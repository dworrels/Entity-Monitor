Only the $850 Zyon\u2014<a href=\"https://www.zyonhelmets.com/\">available now for preorder</a> and delivery later in the year\u2014offers both medical grade air purification and top-tier impact protection in a single system.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91373772\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-2-91372582-air-filtering-helmet.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Image: Zyon Helmets]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is currently no approved helmet on the market that includes an integrated filtration system,&#8221; Tanguy Uzel, founder of the Madrid-based Zyon Helmets, tells me via email. &#8220;The only exception is a model developed by an Indian brand, which does not have homologation or European and American safety standards.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The core of the Zyon is its Breath Safe System, which the company claims processes every molecule of air before it enters your body. How much do you need this? Motorcyclists suffer PM2.5 exposures of 75 micrograms per cubic meter, 5 times more than pedestrians and 15 times more than car occupants. This pollution penetrates lung alveoli and enters the bloodstream, causing chronic inflammation that has been<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4740125/#:~:text=Scientists%20in%20Canada%20and%20the,5%20(18).\"> linked to cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HEPA filters have demonstrated 48% to 60% reductions in allergic symptoms, outperforming many pharmaceutical treatments. Activated carbon neutralizes gases like carbon monoxide, whose exposure above 9 parts per million significantly reduces lung function in commercial drivers. While no portable system completely eliminates gas exposure, partial reduction provides significant health benefits during chronic urban exposure.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91373773\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-1-91372582-air-filtering-helmet.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Image: Zyon Helmets]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-multilayer-filtering\">Multilayer filtering</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zyon has three layers located inside the chin guard, where you can see its honeycomb openings and a mechanism to change the air-intake according to your speed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first hydrophobic barrier blocks water and insects. The second layer employs H13 HEPA filters that capture 99.95% of particles down to 0.3 microns, including the dangerous PM2.5 particles that penetrate deep into the respiratory system and enter the bloodstream, causing chronic inflammation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A third layer uses activated carbon to absorb poisonous gases like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides that escape from exhaust pipes, the company says. A final layer protects the assembly and maintains filter integrity for one to three months of use, depending on the quality of the air during easy rides. This multi-layer filter design eliminates 99% of the pollution that motorcyclists would normally inhale in a city, where concentrations of toxic particles reach levels that would trigger health warnings if they occurred indoors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s for your lungs. For your cranium, the helmet uses the Swedish multidirectional impact protection system (MIPS), which reduces rotational forces during a crash. A low-friction layer allows the helmet to move 10 to 15 millimeters relative to the head during impact, deflecting energy that could damage the brain. This technology functions without interfering with the filtration system or the neck sealing necessary to maintain clean air, the company points out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ECE 22.06 P/J certification (introduced in the EU in 2022) triples the number of impact points tested compared to previous regulations and includes oblique impacts that simulate real accidents. The U.S. uses the Department of Transportation\u2019s FMVSS 218 standard, which is legally required but is considered a Mickey Mouse-level protection that provides \u201c<a href=\"https://ilmotor.com/blogs/news/about-helmet-standards-what-is-the-difference-between-the-american-dot-standard-and-the-european-ece-standard\">minimum helmet performance</a>\u201d rather than optimal protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91373774\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-3-91372582-air-filtering-helmet.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Image: Zyon Helmets]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-three-mode-ventilation\">Three-mode ventilation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The company claims its helmet maintains effective ventilation, even when stopped at traffic lights, through three modes without the need for electric fans. It offers Urban for slow traffic, Road for medium speeds, and Touring for highway use. A single mechanism switches between modes according to riding conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company says that air enters through the front intake, filters through the four layers, circulates through internal channels, and exits through rear vents. This continuous current maintains positive pressure inside the helmet, preventing dirty air from entering through small leaks in the sealing\u2014a critical detail that makes the filtration effective. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our filter acts by electrostatic attraction to capture fine particles and by chemical reaction with a layer of active carbon to neutralize toxic gases. Unlike mechanical filters (such as those of masks), this system allows better breathability, but also requires regular replacement,&#8221; Uzel tells me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zyon\u2019s shell combines fiberglass with organic materials in an integrated matrix. The materials are chemically bonded together during manufacturing to create a single, unified composite material rather than separate layers glued together. The glass fibers provide strength and prevent cracking, while the organic resin allows controlled flexibility that absorbs crash energy by deforming slightly instead of transmitting all the impact force directly to your head, which your brain will be happy about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The helmet is loaded with some clever electronics too, including integrated air quality sensors that can talk to a mobile app that monitors what goes through the filtering system and warns when the filter needs changing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The duration of the filter depends on the environment, but it is recommended to change it every one to three months. Once opened, even without use, it begins to lose properties due to exposure to air,&#8221; Uzel says. &#8220;The helmet detects flights and air conditions in real time. From that data, the app generates custom statistics on the filtered contamination level and filter performance, and notifies the user when to replace it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The helmet also has aviation-class accelerometers, which will identify accident patterns and automatically alert emergency services in your phone\u2014a potentially lifesaving technology for riders who crash in remote areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear light activates when braking through the same motion sensors whenever they detect deceleration, improving visibility especially in low-light conditions or high pollution. The battery provides 18 hours of autonomy and charges via USB-C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like a great design, if it works like they say. The combination of medical filtration, MIPS protection, and smart electronics should protect you against the two main threats that motorcyclists face: accidents and pollution. For riders who spend hours daily breathing toxic urban air, this could be the solution.</p>",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91349797/global-fertility-rate-un-report-having-fewer-children-wars-pandemics-climate-change-fear\">The fertility rate</a> in the U.S. dropped to an all-time low in 2024 with less than 1.6 kids per woman, new federal data released Thursday shows.<br /><br />The U.S. was once among only a few developed countries with a rate that ensured each generation had enough children to replace itself \u2014 about 2.1 kids per woman. But it <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90290981/u-s-fertility-rates-these-maps-show-which-states-may-face-workplace-replacement-issues\">has been sliding in America</a> for close to two decades as more women are waiting longer to have children or never taking that step at all.<br />The new statistic is on par with fertility rates in western European countries, according to World Bank data.<br /><br />Alarmed by recent drops, the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91331189/heres-why-trumps-proposed-5000-baby-bonus-isnt-much-of-a-mothers-day-present\">Trump administration</a> <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91324403/trumps-plans-for-a-baby-boom-wont-work\">has taken steps</a> to increase falling birth rates, like issuing an executive order meant to expand access to and reduce costs of in vitro fertilization and backing the idea of &#8220;baby bonuses&#8221; that might encourage more couples to have kids.<br /><br />But there&#8217;s no reason to be alarmed, according to Leslie Root, a University of Colorado Boulder researcher focused on fertility and population policy.<br /><br />&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing this as part of an ongoing process of fertility delay. We know that the U.S. population is still growing, and we still have a natural increase \u2014 more births than deaths,&#8221; she said.<br /><br />The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the statistic for the total fertility rate with updated birth data for 2024.<br /><br />In the early 1960s, the U.S. total fertility rate was around 3.5, but plummeted to 1.7 by 1976 after the Baby Boom ended. It gradually rose to 2.1 in 2007 before falling again, aside from a 2014 uptick. The rate in 2023 was 1.621, and inched down in 2024 to 1.599, according to the CDC&#8217;s National Center for Health Statistics.<br /><br />Birth rates are generally declining for women in most age groups \u2014 and that doesn&#8217;t seem likely to change in the near future, said Karen Guzzo, director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina.<br /><br />People are marrying later and also worried about their ability to have the money, health insurance and other resources needed to raise children in a stable environment.<br /><br />&#8220;Worry is not a good moment to have kids,&#8221; and that&#8217;s why birth rates in most age groups are not improving, she said.<br /><br />Asked about birth-promoting measures outlined by the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91275267/trumps-transportation-secretary-wants-to-tie-funding-to-birth-rates-in-a-disturbingly-dystopian-agenda\">Trump administration</a>, Guzzo said they don&#8217;t tackle larger needs like parental leave and affordable child care.<br /><br />&#8220;The things that they are doing are really symbolic and not likely to budge things for real Americans,&#8221; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-increase-in-births-in-new-data\">Increase in births in new data</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The CDC&#8217;s new report, which is based on a more complete review of birth certificates than provisional data released earlier this year, also showed a 1% increase in births \u2014 about 33,000 more \u2014 last year compared to the prior year.<br />That brought the yearly national total to just over 3.6 million babies born.<br /><br />But this is different: The provisional data indicated birth rate increases last year for women in their late 20s and 30s. However, the new report found birth rate declines for women in their 20s and early 30s, and no change for women in their late 30s.<br /><br />What happened? CDC officials said it was due to recalculations stemming from a change in the U.S. Census population estimates used to compute the birth rate.<br />That&#8217;s plausible, Root said. As the total population of women of childbearing age grew due to immigration, it offset small increases in births to women in those age groups, she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute&#8217;s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

At first the sneaker is black, but its finish is designed to flake off with time, revealing blue, green, and yellow panels underneath. It give each pair a unique pattern that&#8217;s special to the wearer. Think of it as a data visualization of your walking patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91373647\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-2-91362157-nike-shoe-dataviz.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Nike]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>AJ purists may be used to leaving their purchase in the box to keep it in mint condition, but the concept of scratch-off shoes flips scuff marks from a negative to a plus. The Air Jordan 1 High OG Self-Expression gives scuff marks value: wearing in the shoe so it doesn&#8217;t<em> </em>look the same as when you bought it is intrinsic to the design. It&#8217;s an innovative alternative to typical product customization.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91373648\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-1-91362157-nike-shoe-dataviz.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Nike]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91358181/nike-and-levis-team-up-on-denim-sportswear\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nike</a> has previously put out <a href=\"https://hypebeast.com/2020/12/nike-air-max-1-yours-summit-white-white-sail-medium-khaki-wear-away-reveal\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rub away Air Max 1s</a> and <a href=\"https://hypebeast.com/2019/3/nike-sb-air-jordan-1-retro-high-og-closer-look\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nike SB x Air Jordan 1s with wear-away uppers</a>, while their <a href=\"https://www.nike.com/launch/t/air-force-1-low-dirty-triple-white\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Air Force 1 Low Dirty Triple White</a> ages backwards to reveal a brighter, whiter, cleaner layer underneath an outer layer that already looks worn. <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91064679/dr-martens-x-supremes-new-weather-forecast-shoes-are-so-ugly-they-might-be-beautiful\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Martens got in on the trend last year with color-changing shoes</a> with brown and black topcoats that wore off to reveal bright green and blue as part of a collaboration with Supreme. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91373650\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-3-91362157-nike-shoe-dataviz.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Nike]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For Nike, bringing the effect to the Air Jordan adds a fun new way to experience one of the company&#8217;s signature shoes. &#8220;The\u00a0Air\u00a0Jordan\u00a01\u00a0transcended its basketball origins to become a cultural phenomenon in\u00a0the\u00a01980s, influencing diverse subcultures such as hip-hop, rock, skateboarding, and youth culture,&#8221; Air Jordan&#8217;s Kenlyn Tyree tells <em>Fast Company</em>. &#8220;Its blend of style, comfort, and performance made it a symbol of self-expression and status for a generation of young people.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, apparel made from materials like raw denim or leather are thought to get better with wear, but with rub-away shoes, that idea is taken to another level. The imperfections are the point, and with Nike&#8217;s color-changing Air Jordan 1s, the bold, bright colors draw attention to them even more.</p>",

    "description": "<p>President <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a> declared Wednesday that the United States will \u201cwin\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/ai\">artificial intelligence</a> race. He made the declaration before signing three executive orders aimed at expediting <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a>-related infrastructure projects, promoting and exporting American-made AI technology, and preventing \u201cwoke AI\u201d in the federal government.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in the day, the White House released a 28-page <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf/https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf\">AI Action Plan</a>, which lays out a detailed policy agenda to accelerate AI innovation, build AI infrastructure, and lead in international AI diplomacy and security. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plan paints a bucolic picture of sorts, in which American workers will benefit from the opportunities created by this technological revolution, including high-paying jobs and scientific discoveries, while the private sector is unencumbered by bureaucratic red tape and onerous regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-whatever-it-takes\">&#8216;Whatever it takes&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But Trump also made clear that his AI policy marks a stark departure from the AI guardrails endorsed by President <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/joe-biden\">Joe Biden</a>. During a speech Wednesday at an event cohosted by the Hill and Valley Forum and the <em>All-In</em> podcast, Trump took swipes at a number of policies endorsed by his political opponents and told the audience, \u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of woke.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The White House\u2019s AI agenda outlines risks to innovation from anything perceived as a hindrance\u2014be it ideological policies or environmental regulations\u2014and the executive orders continue a pattern of Trump revoking the policies of his predecessor. The president vowed to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to lead the world in AI innovation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWith your help, that golden age will be built by American workers, it will be powered by American energy, it will be run on American technology improved by American artificial intelligence, and it will make America richer, stronger, greater, freer, and more powerful than ever before,\u201d he told the tech-heavy audience.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-recommended-policy-actions\">Recommended policy actions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Among dozens of recommended policy actions, the AI Action Plan calls for eliminating references to misinformation, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/dei\">diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)</a>, and climate change. What\u2019s more, it notes that AI models must be built on what are referred to as \u201cAmerican values,\u201d without providing specifics about what those values are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-orders/\">executive orders</a> that Trump signed Wednesday also calls for modifying various environmental regulations to streamline and accelerate the federal permitting of data center infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-silicon-valley-s-role\">Silicon Valley&#8217;s role</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump\u2019s AI policy was <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91373066/how-silicon-valley-billionaires-shaped-trumps-new-ai-agenda\">heavily shaped by his Silicon Valley donors</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/david-sacks\">David Sacks</a>, one of four cohosts of the <em>All-In</em> podcast and Trump\u2019s special adviser for AI and crypto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Trump complimented the \u201cgenius and creativity\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/silicon-valley\">Silicon Valley</a>, he also called on change from the technology community. \u201cWinning the new AI race will demand a new spirit of patriotism and national loyalty in Silicon Valley.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 100 groups\u2014including the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the National Organization for Women (NOW), and Oxfam America\u2014<a href=\"https://peoplesaiaction.com/\">signed a resolution</a> opposing the AI action plan, which they describe as being written by Big Tech and Big Oil. These groups instead advocated for a \u201cPeople\u2019s AI Action Plan.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-just-popped-out-of-the-air\">&#8216;Just popped out of the air&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But even Trump seemed, at times, dubious or just naive about the technological revolution he intends to lead. Though AI technology is hardly new, Trump said it was \u201csomething that nobody expected, it just popped out of the air\u201d and also suggested that AI needs a new moniker because he doesn\u2019t like the word \u201cartificial\u201d and prefers the word \u201cgenius\u201d instead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhether we like it or not, we\u2019re suddenly engaged in a fast-paced competition to build and define this groundbreaking technology that will determine so much about the future of civilization itself,\u201d he told the audience.</p>",

    "description": "<p>U.S. automakers worry that President Donald <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91373059/trump-cuts-tariffs-japan-asia-economic-fallout\">Trump&#8217;s agreement to tariff</a> Japanese vehicles at 15% would put them at a competitive disadvantage, saying they will face steeper import <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91345871/trumps-50-tariffs-steel-aluminum-imminent-heres-what-know\">taxes on steel, aluminum</a> and parts than their competitors.<br /><br />&#8220;We need to review all the details of the agreement, but this is a deal that will charge lower tariffs on Japanese autos with no U.S. content,&#8221; said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents the Big 3 American automakers, General Motors, Ford and Jeep-maker Stellantis.<br /><br />Blunt said in an interview the U.S. companies and workers &#8220;definitely are at a disadvantage&#8221; because they face a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tariff on parts and finished vehicles, with some exceptions for products covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that went into effect in 2020.<br /><br />The domestic automaker reaction reveals the challenge of enforcing policies across the world economy, showing that for all of Trump&#8217;s promises there can be genuine tradeoffs from policy choices that risk serious blowback in politically important states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, where automaking is both a source of income and of identity.<br /><br />The United Auto Workers said in a statement it was &#8220;deeply angered&#8221; by the deal. &#8220;A better deal would have held Japanese automakers to the same standards U.S. workers have fought for at GM, Ford, and Stellantis,&#8221; the UAW said.<br /><br />&#8220;If this becomes the blueprint for trade with Europe or South Korea, it will be a major missed opportunity,&#8221; the union added. &#8220;We need trade deals that raise standards \u2014 not reward the race to the bottom. This deal does the opposite.&#8221;<br /><br />Trump portrayed the trade framework as a major win after announcing it on Tuesday, saying it would add hundreds of thousands of jobs to the U.S. economy and open the Japanese economy in ways that could close a persistent trade imbalance. The agreement includes a 15% tariff that replaces the 25% import tax the Republican president had threatened to charge starting on Aug. 1. Japan would also put together $550 billion to invest in U.S. projects at the &#8220;direction&#8221; of the president, the White House said.<br /><br />The framework with Japan will remove regulations that prevent American vehicles from being sold in that country, the White House has said, adding that it would be possible for vehicles built in Detroit to be shipped directly to Japan and ready to be sold.<br /><br />But Blunt said that foreign auto producers, including the U.S., Europe and South Korea, have just a 6% share in Japan, raising skepticism that simply having the open market that the Trump administration says will exist in that country will be sufficient.<br /><br />&#8220;Tough nut to crack, and I&#8217;d be very surprised if we see any meaningful market penetration in Japan,&#8221; Blunt said.<br /><br />Asked at Wednesday&#8217;s briefing about whether Trump&#8217;s sectoral tariffs such as those on autos were now subject to possible change, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the issue had been going through the Commerce Department.<br /><br />The framework with Japan was also an indication that some nations simply saw it as preferential to have a set tariff rate rather than be whipsawed by Trump&#8217;s changes on import taxes since April. But for the moment, both Japan and the United Kingdom with its quotas on auto exports might enjoy a competitive edge in the U.S.<br /><br />&#8220;With this agreement in place it provides Japan with a near-term operating cost advantage compared to other foreign automakers, and even some domestic U.S. product that uses a high degree of both foreign production and parts content,&#8221; said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars. &#8220;It will be interesting to see if this is the first domino to fall in a series of foreign countries that decide long-term stability is more important that short term disputes over specific tariff rates.&#8221;<br /><br />Autos Drive America, an organization that represents major Japanese companies Toyota, Honda and Nissan and other international automakers, said in a statement that it is &#8220;encouraged&#8221; by the announced trade framework and noted its members have exceeded domestic automaker production for the past two years.<br /><br />The statement urged &#8220;the Trump administration to swiftly reach similar agreements with other allies and partners, especially the European Union, South Korea, Canada and Mexico.&#8221;<br /><br />The Japanese framework could give automakers and other countries grounds for pushing for changes in the Trump administration&#8217;s tariffs regime. The president has previously said that he values flexibility in negotiating import taxes. The USMCA is up for review next year.<br /><br />Ford, GM and Stellantis do &#8220;have every right to be upset,&#8221; said Sam Fiorani, vice president at consultancy AutoForecast Solutions. But &#8220;Honda, Toyota, and Nissan still import vehicles from Mexico and Canada, where the current levels of tariffs can be higher than those applied to Japanese imports. Most of the high-volume models from Japanese brands are already produced in North America.&#8221;<br /><br />Fiorani noted that among the few exceptions are the Toyota 4Runner, the Mazda CX-5 and the Subaru Forester, but most of the other imports fill niches that are too small to warrant production in the U.S.<br /><br />&#8220;There will be negotiations between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico, and it will probably result in tariffs no higher than 15%,&#8221; Fiorani added, &#8220;but nobody seems to be in a hurry to negotiate around the last Trump administration&#8217;s free trade agreement.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>St. John contributed from Detroit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u2014Josh Boak and Alex St. John, Associated Press</em></p>",

    "description": "<p>You landed a job interview: You\u2019ve researched the company, reread the job listing, and practiced your talking points. But have you considered the importance of choosing the right time of day to interview? According to new research, when you interview might impact how well you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1605041/abstract\">study</a> analyzing the timing and performance of Italian students in oral interviews\u2014which are required to pass many classes at Italian universities\u2014researchers found that the time of day had a big impact on students\u2019 likelihood of success. Researchers believe the study could shed light on successes and failures in other high-pressure situations, like job interviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers utilized a University of Messina database of interview-style exam results from October 2018 to February 2020. Data from more than 100,000 exams revealed that the rate of students who passed followed a bell curve that peaked between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. and was much lower in the early morning and late afternoon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research was inspired by a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1018033108\">study</a> that found judges are more lenient in their sentencing at the beginning of the court session or after meal breaks, says Carmelo Vicario, a neuroscientist at the University of Messina and lead author of the new study. After seeing the data on judicial rulings, Vicario says he was interested in discovering whether the same principle might apply to other fields, including education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis was, of course, a completely different field,\u201d Vicario tells <em>Fast Company</em>. \u201cBut we found this similarity.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the study analyzes existing data, rather than data from controlled trials, Vicario says he isn\u2019t able to confirm exactly why the middle of the day seems to be when students are most successful. Still, the researchers have a number of theories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, since younger people tend to be night owls and older people tend to prefer the morning, the middle of the day might help mitigate the clash between these \u201cchronotypes,\u201d or biological rhythms that impact how alert people are throughout the day. Between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. could be a middle ground when both students and their professors are in their prime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This same mismatch between chronotypes could contribute to the difference in interview success during the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/hiring\" title=\"Hiring\">hiring</a> process for young workers being interviewed by more senior employees, adding to the bias that an estimated 36% have against Gen Z candidates, according to a recent <a href=\"https://www.resumebuilder.com/1-in-3-hiring-managers-say-its-beneficial-to-avoid-hiring-gen-z-senior-candidates/\">ResumeBuilder</a> survey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2015.00100/full\">80 genes</a> regulate the circadian rhythms behind different chronotypes, and people consistently operating outside the hours that work with their circadian rhythm can experience issues with <a href=\"https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-018-0162-z\">productivity</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2019.0098\">health problems</a> and <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349142361_Sleep_and_chronotype_in_relation_to_work-related_stress_and_negative_affect_The_moderating_role_of_a_flexible_start_of_work\">work-related anxiety</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help overcome bias related to the time of day, experts have a few <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91358233/the-9-5-might-be-hurting-your-teams-performance\">tips</a> that can be applied to everything from exams to job interviews and beyond, such as offering flexible meeting hours and scheduling collaboration when both parties have high energy levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBy recognizing biological differences in how and when people work best\u2014and making room for that diversity\u2014leaders can reduce hidden bias, unlock untapped potential, and build more <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/productivity\" title=\"Productivity\">productive</a> and inclusive teams,\u201d Camilla Kring, a researcher who studies applied chronology, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91358233/the-9-5-might-be-hurting-your-teams-performance\">wrote</a> in a recent article for <em>Fast Company</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, authors of the new study note that more research is needed to determine whether mismatched chronotypes are the hidden force behind varying interview success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEven this is a speculative interpretation,\u201d Vicario says, noting his hope that this work will inspire future research that helps to pin down exactly why interviews in the middle of the day tend to go better. Vicario also hopes people will consider researching the impact of timing on decision-making in other high-pressure situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen there\u2019s a kind of pressure, the influence of the time of the day can be stronger compared to when you have a large amount of time to evaluate the details of the situation,\u201d Vicario says. \u201cBeing aware [of timing\u2019s impact] can make decisions fairer.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<hr />",

Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Trump&#8217;s sweeping tariffs on imports, which Powell says could push up inflation.<br /><br />Powell&#8217;s caution has infuriated Trump, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt.<br /><br />The Fed has been renovating its Washington headquarters and a neighboring building. With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion, from $1.9 billion.<br /><br />When asked last week if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Trump said, &#8220;I think it is.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it&#8217;s really disgraceful,&#8221; Trump said.<br /><br />Firing Powell would threaten the Fed&#8217;s independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors.</p>",

Chipotle reported net income of $436.1 million (32 cents per diluted share), a decrease from $455.7 million (33 cents per diluted share) year-over-year (YOY).\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In premarket trading, Chipotle\u2019s stock price (NYSE:CMG) has plummeted over 12% since the market closed Wednesday night.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Chipotle reported a 3% increase YOY in total revenue, it credited the $3.1 billion sum to the opening of 61 new restaurants.\u00a0In reality, restaurants saw comparable sales drop 4%, thanks to smaller bills. Wall Street had predicted a 2.9% decrease, according to consensus estimates <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/23/chipotle-mexican-grill-cmg-q2-2025-earnings.html\">cited by CNBC</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-eating-american-diners\">What&#8217;s eating American diners?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a post-earnings investors meeting, Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright blamed \u201congoing volatility\u201d in consumer environment trends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMuch of what we\u2019re experiencing right now is due to macro and the consumer. The low-income consumer is looking for value as a price point at present,\u201d Boatwright stated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91368442/prices-are-rising-again-heres-what-just-got-more-expensive\">Tariffs</a> are also a factor, with Chipotle estimating a 0.5% rise in cost of sales.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chipotle\u2019s decline is part of a broader trend. Fast food restaurants saw a 0.9% decrease in traffic YOY during quarter two, <a href=\"https://www.revenuemanage.com/trends/restaurant-trends-july-2025-q2/\">according to a report</a> published this month by Revenue Management Solutions (RMS).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, prices at these quick-service restaurants increased by 1.3% YOY\u2014though this is less than quarter one\u2019s 3.1% increase. Meanwhile, the average bill at Chipotle increased by 0.9%.&nbsp;</p>",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91373966/tesla-stock-price-today-reasons-tsla-shares-down",
    "description": "<p>Investors in Tesla can\u2019t seem to catch a break. Yesterday, Elon Musk\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/evs\" title=\"EVs\">electric vehicle</a> company reported its Q2 2025 results\u2014and they weren\u2019t good. Today, the stock (Nasdaq: TSLA) is down significantly because of it. Here\u2019s what you need to know about TSLA\u2019s latest movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tsla-shares-hit-in-early-trading\">TSLA shares hit in early trading</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As of the time of this writing, TSLA shares are currently down over 6%, or $20 per share, to $312.56 in premarket trading. That drop comes after the company reported its second-quarter results for its fiscal 2025 yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company <a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-second-quarter-2025-production-deliveries-deployments\">reported</a> that it produced 410,244 vehicles during the quarter, over 396,000 of which were its popular models 3 and Y. During the same period, Tesla delivered 384,122 vehicles, its models 3 and Y accounting for over 373,000 of those deliveries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what seems to have concerned investors the most about the company\u2019s Q2 results is its revenue number. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the quarter, Tesla reported revenue of $22.5 billion. That was a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91373639/tesla-steepest-decline-quarterly-revenue-over-a-decade\">12% decline</a> from the $25.5 billion that the company posted in the same quarter a year earlier. It was also worse than the $22.74 billion in revenue that many analysts were expecting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even worse was that this revenue decline was the second quarterly revenue drop in a row, and it came after Tesla launched refreshed versions of its popular Model Y SUV.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-factors-weighing-tesla-down\">3 factors weighing Tesla down</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla is facing several problems, which are both impacting its revenue and making investors nervous for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main problem is that Tesla\u2019s revenues are declining. This decline can be attributed to multiple factors, the first being Musk himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since CEO Elon Musk leapt headfirst into politics earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91313599/can-the-tesla-brand-be-saved\">Tesla\u2019s brand has taken a</a> popularity hit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk\u2019s leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)\u2014and the extreme cuts it implemented after President Trump\u2019s inauguration\u2014was deeply unpopular with progressives, who have historically been the ones attracted to Tesla\u2019s electric vehicles. This alienation of a large part of Tesla\u2019s customer base hasn\u2019t done the company any favors as far as sales are concerned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Musk isn\u2019t directly to blame for all of the problems Tesla is facing. The second factor hurting the company is increased competition <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91270755/byd-most-innovative-companies-2025\">from electric vehicles produced by competitors</a> around the world. Car manufacturers of all stripes, from America to Europe to Asia, are releasing EVs that are often much more affordable than Tesla\u2019s, giving customers cheaper options to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A third factor that is likely weighing on investors\u2019 minds is the upcoming expiration of the $7,500 <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91363601/thinking-of-buying-an-ev-your-tax-credit-window-is-closing\">electric vehicle tax credit</a> in the United States. This EV credit was killed in Trump\u2019s Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Elon Musk vehemently opposed. The credit expires on September 30, and investors are nervous about how the loss of the credit will impact sales of Tesla\u2019s pricy EVs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tsla-shares-have-had-a-rough-2025\">TSLA shares have had a rough 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After Tesla\u2019s disappointing Q2 2025 earnings yesterday, the stock is down over 6% in premarket trading this morning as of the time of this writing. However, that\u2019s not the worst news when it comes to Tesla\u2019s stock price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After hitting an all-time high of $488.54 per share in December 2024, TSLA shares have declined sharply. As of yesterday\u2019s close at $332 per share, Tesla\u2019s shares have declined 17.6% this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla\u2019s additional 6% decline is only compounding those losses and shows that investors are still jittery about where the company\u2019s sales go from here.</p>",

But his latest book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/19596/9780593799550\"><em>Time Anxiety</em></a>, tackles something different: our collective panic about never having enough hours in the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book challenges <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/productivity\" title=\"Productivity\">productivity</a> culture&#8217;s relentless optimization, offering counterintuitive solutions like embracing &#8220;granny hobbies&#8221; and creating \u201creverse bucket lists.\u201d For Guillebeau, who admits he&#8217;s &#8220;very forward-minded&#8221; and constantly asking \u201cWhat&#8217;s next?\u201d these insights emerged from his own struggles with time pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fast Company</em> spoke with Guillebeau about why excellence isn&#8217;t always the goal, what he learned from visiting every country, and how to find meaning when you can&#8217;t control your legacy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You introduce this concept of the \u201creverse bucket list.\u201d Why is looking backward as important as looking forward?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a very forward-minded person. I\u2019m always like, <em>What&#8217;s next?</em> It&#8217;s like, <em>Oh, the book is out. What&#8217;s the next book?</em> And it\u2019s like, well, I just spent two years writing this book. Maybe I should live in that zone for a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reverse bucket list is just like it sounds\u2014what have I done that is interesting or notable, whether to other people or not? I think it\u2019s helpful to just celebrate or even observe some of those things. You can do it as a big picture, like a life bucket list, or you can just be like, what\u2019s your list of things that you\u2019ve gotten done today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of us who tend to be thinking more about the future, perhaps reflecting on what we&#8217;ve been able to do thus far can actually bring us to a centering point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You visited every country in the world before age 35. What surprised you about that experience?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I first got into that idea because I\u2019m kind of compulsive, and I am a list maker. I was an aid worker in West Africa in my early twenties, and I\u2019d been to maybe 70 countries. I was like, how many are there, and what would it take to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of my favorite discoveries were the Baltics and the Balkans. Places like Lithuania and Montenegro ended up being really peaceful spots where I had great experiences and met interesting people. I definitely wouldn&#8217;t have gone to either of those places if it wasn&#8217;t for having this objective. There was something about combining a love of travel with a love of goal setting and list making that made it really work for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The book mentions someone who flew to different European cities every Wednesday, only to fly right back without visiting. What&#8217;s the lesson there?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Dutch guy would go to Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam every Wednesday for 20 years and fly somewhere within Europe\u2014Stockholm or Barcelona\u2014spend a couple of hours in the terminal, then fly back. That was his happy place, his Zen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people are gonna say, \u201cOh, that&#8217;s so dumb. He&#8217;s doing all this travel without ever traveling anywhere.\u201d But the point is, that&#8217;s something that made him feel alive. It gave him a little milestone to anchor the rest of his life with. There&#8217;s some weird thing like that for everybody. The whole point is to figure out what that looks like to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You advocate for \u201cgranny hobbies\u201d and tactile breaks. Why are these important in our digital age?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s actually research behind having a hobby that&#8217;s hands-on but \u201cthumbs-down\u201d\u2014meaning not digital, not scrolling. It could be knitting, baking, gardening. These are things that are really easy to pick up, and you can leave them for a while and come back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research shows this actually can reduce anxiety and contribute to peace of mind. And it\u2019s low pressure. If your knitting project goes awry, oh well. It\u2019s not like you forgot to use BCC and emailed a hundred people by mistake. These hobbies get us operating on a different time schedule\u2014you&#8217;re not racing against a digital deadline, but working more slowly to hand-make something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your \u201cthree-quarter-ass rule\u201d seems to challenge conventional wisdom about aiming for consistent excellence. Why do we need permission to not do our best?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to run an event series, and the team would spend forever talking about tiny details. Someone finally said, \u201cWe don&#8217;t want to half-ass it, but do we really need to put our full ass behind this thing? Can we just three-quarter-ass it?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t actually do your best at everything. It\u2019s not possible. Life is about choice and selection. You want to maybe pick a couple of things to be excellent at, and for everything else, there are ways of not doing things or doing them adequately. Excellence is not always the standard. Sometimes done is better than perfect, especially for those of us who get stuck because we want things to be perfect and don&#8217;t even know where to begin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How has writing this book changed your own relationship with time?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to think a lot about legacy: What do we leave behind? But I&#8217;ve distanced myself from that because legacy is something we can&#8217;t really control. Most things we do are forgotten. People who leave legacies aren&#8217;t on some 60-year strategic plan. They&#8217;re just doing things that ultimately have a positive impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve shifted to focusing more on living well. What does it mean to live well? Hopefully that involves contribution and service. I want to make some part of the world a little better, and that\u2019s achievable. It\u2019s measurable for those who want to measure it, and even if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s intuitively knowable.</p>\n\n\n<hr />",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91373504/national-tequila-day-2025-deals-today-history-mexican-liquor",
    "description": "<p>Tequila, the Mexican hard liquor that&#8217;s become a bar staple, has its very own holiday to celebrate its crisp, earthy flavors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today (Thursday, July 24) is National Tequila Day. Let\u2019s take a look at the history of the adult beverage so you can wow your coworkers at happy hour. Then we can explore some fun offers to celebrate the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-shot-or-two-of-tequila-history\">A shot or two of tequila history</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A forerunner to the modern hard liquor dates back to the <a href=\"https://www.liquor.com/articles/history-of-tequila/\">Aztecs (and possibilty even</a> earlier civilizations) in Mexico, as noted by Liquor.com. They fermented the sap of the agave plant to create a milky beverage called pulque and worshipped the husband-and-wife god duo behind this act, Mayahuel and Patecatl.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spanish arrived in Mexico in 1517 and two years later began their conquest to take over. The soldiers missed brandy and began to experiment with mud stills and agave to replace it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually the Marquis of Altamira took things a step further. He opened the first major distillery in the early 1600s in present-day Tequila, Jalisco.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cuervo family took things commercial in 1758 with their own distillery. The Sauza family followed suit in 1873. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is believed that <a href=\"https://www.casamexicotequila.com/the-history-of-tequila-in-north-america-part-2/\">Don Cenobio Sauza</a> first imported tequila to the United States in 1873. The alcohol was present at the 1893 Chicago World&#8217;s Fair. The spirit also grew in popularity during <a href=\"https://distilleryway.com/articles/history-of-tequila#:~:text=The%2020th%20Century&amp;text=During%20prohibition%20in%20the%20U.S.,using%20specific%20varieties%20of%20agave.\">Prohibition</a> as it was easily smuggled into the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The invention of the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91281754/national-margarita-day-2025-best-deals-history-of-the-drink\">margarita</a> in the 1940s further strengthened tequila\u2019s public relations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1974 Mexico declared tequila its intellectual property meaning it had to be made and aged in certain regions of the country. The Tequila Regulatory Council was formed 20 years later in part for quality control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What truly cemented tequila\u2019s legacy was when imported tequila shifted from <a href=\"https://www.liquor.com/oral-history-of-tequila-5271627\">\u201cmixto,\u201d</a> a combination of a tequila from agave plants and other sugars, to a 100% agave tequila. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bartenders loved using these \u201cpure\u201d liquids to create even more yummy cocktails. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, these smaller batched craft creations helped elevate the liquor, while the celebrity endorsements didn\u2019t hurt either. (We\u2019re looking at you, George Clooney and Casamigos.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, the United States is tequila\u2019s best customer. In 2024, almost 32.2 million 9-liter cases were sold, making it the best year ever for the spirit, according to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/2060/tequila/#topicOverview\">Statista.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-celebrate-national-tequila-day\">How to celebrate National Tequila Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After that lengthy history lesson, you probably worked up a thirst and want to help the 2025 statistics. Below are a few deals to be had for National Tequila Day:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Chili&#8217;s</strong>: Restaurant chain Chili\u2019s is <a href=\"https://www.chilis.com/margaritas\">here to help</a>. It is offering $5 Tequila Trifectas.

    "description": "<p>Tesla is speeding toward a head-on collision with the realities of the auto industry. Amid protests over CEO Elon Musk\u2019s involvement with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, not to mention Tesla\u2019s stagnant model line and obsolete technology, the company\u2019s revenue for the first quarter of 2025 slid 9% year over year to $19.34 billion while global deliveries shrank 13%. The second quarter was equally dire: Tesla delivered just 384,122 cars, down 13% year over year, and took in $22.5 billion in revenue, 12% lower than the same period last year. Tesla sales have now been eclipsed by China\u2019s BYD for three consecutive quarters.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Musk wants Tesla fanboys not to worry. Instead of focusing on the company\u2019s declining sales figures, Musk spent most of his opening remarks on his recent earnings call talking about the enormous potential of the company\u2019s Robotaxi service and Optimus humanoid robots to make Tesla\u2014and its investors\u2014very, very rich.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those promises are still rather hollow. Tesla\u2019s Robotaxi service, which arrived in Austin in June, is still an invite-only test limited to a small geofenced area. Competitor Waymo has more than 100 fully autonomous vehicles operating on the Uber platform in that city, covering a 90-square-mile area. Tesla covers <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/waymo-tesla-robotaxi-service-area-expansion-austin-texas-phallic-shaped-2025-7\">a fraction of that</a> in a zone shaped like a penis because Musk is a comedy genius. (&#8220;It&#8217;s going to get bigger and longer,&#8221; he told investors on his recent earnings call.) It\u2019s also <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/tesla-robotaxi-incidents-spark-confusion-concerns-austin-rcna215909\">full of dangerous glitches</a> that reveal the limitations of Musk\u2019s self-driving solution, which currently relies <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2025/05/17/tesla-robotaxi-will-have-lots-of-tele-ops-ie-supervised-fsd/\">heavily on tele-operators</a> to avoid fatal accidents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weeks after the Tesla service launched, the city of Austin says the <a href=\"https://www.fox7austin.com/news/austin-city-council-presented-driverless-car-update\">test remains limited to 10 to 20 Model Y cars</a>, which look nothing like the actual Robotaxi design Musk originally presented to investors. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91270760/waymo-most-innovative-companies-2025\">Google&#8217;s Waymo</a> and Baidu&#8217;s Apollo Go autonomous cab services continue to expand across the planet, with thousands of cars already on the streets thanks to designs that combine <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> brains with multiple optical, radar, and laser sensors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other promise\u2014the <em>really</em> big one\u2014is Optimus, the humanoid robot that Musk has said could one day transform his company into a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2024/06/14/elon-musk-says-teslas-optimus-robot-could-drive-company-to-25-trillion-valuation-heres-what-experts-think/\">$25 trillion market-cap, world-dominating empire</a>. In Musk\u2019s vision, legions of 5-foot-8 electric androids running Tesla\u2019s vehicle-grade AI will ferry battery cells, haul parts carts, and stack sheet-metal blanks across the company\u2019s gigafactories, taking on the dull, injury-prone chores no human wants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These bots, he has said, will be working on Tesla assembly lines by the end of 2025. Next year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/23/elon-musk-tesla-humanoid-robots-optimus\">they\u2019ll roam third-party warehouses</a> and logistics hubs across North America. Within five years, Musk promises, Tesla will be making 1 million units per year. Within a decade, <a href=\"https://qz.com/elon-musk-tesla-market-cap-robots-optimus-robotaxis-1851540331\">there could be 100 million of them</a> in the wild as companies worldwide deploy them for stockroom restocking, parcel delivery, elder-care assistance, and other services. Conveniently, their sales would buoy Tesla\u2019s share price just as its core <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/evs\" title=\"EVs\">EV</a> lineup shows its vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOptimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue, like it\u2019s really bananas,\u201d Musk told investors in April.&nbsp;&#8220;It will be the biggest product ever,&#8221; he reiterated on the July 22 earnings call.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Except, just like with Robotaxi, it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s working out as promised. At this point, it&#8217;s extremely hard to believe that Optimus will materialize in any meaningful way within the timeframe Musk anticipates. It\u2019s even harder to believe that the program can get off the ground quickly enough to compete with companies that appear to be further ahead in developing and deploying humanoid robots\u2014especially in China, where competitors have the advantage of fully dominating the supply chain to manufacture bots at scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91372636\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-2-91372600-elon-musk-humanoid-robots.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Image: Tesla]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Market analysts predict the entire humanoid robot market could reach $13 billion to $38 billion between 2030 and 2035 (making Musk&#8217;s claims of $10 trillion in annual revenue mathematically impossible, at least for the next decade). Meanwhile, the industry is still in its Macintosh era, according to Jeff Cardenas, CEO of Apptronik, which makes the Apollo 1 humanoid robot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is like the early 1980s for personal computers,\u201d Cardenas told me recently. \u201cWe&#8217;re in the early days.\u201d That means there\u2019s a chance for Tesla to catch up. But it also means there\u2019s a Mars-size gap between Musk\u2019s $25 trillion robot revolution and the hard work of actually engineering it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-robot-dreams-meet-hard-reality\">ROBOT DREAMS MEET HARD REALITY</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the Optimus reality today: <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250704PD211/tesla-robot-optimus-production-hardware.html\">Production reportedly froze in mid-June</a> when the bots\u2019 overheating joints, limp wrists, and batteries that croaked before lunchtime forced a complete procurement pause. By then, only about 1,000 bots had rolled off the Fremont, California, pilot line, costing <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jlp_teslas-optimus-bom-cost-is-estimated-at-activity-7327643264830828544-0Y-r/\">around $60,000 apiece</a> to make. According to videos of the bots working, they were moving <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1ksgfel/new_tesla_optimus_video_shows_humanoid_robot/\">at less than half the speed</a> of the humans they are meant to replace.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimus\u2019s problems have prompted a redesign to improve the robots\u2019 performance. Tesla, according to reports, is evaluating new providers of all its key failing components, a <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/tesla-halts-robot-parts-purchase-pending-optimus-design-change\">process that will further delay</a> an already delayed schedule.<strong> </strong>According <a href=\"https://www.ainvest.com/news/tesla-reportedly-pauses-optimus-robot-production-design-overhaul-2507/\">to AInvest</a>, two sources in the Optimus supply chain claim that &#8220;Tesla had procured enough parts to produce 1,200 Optimus units and had manufactured close to 1,000.\u201d Though Musk had claimed the company would produce 5,000 units in 2025, according to these sources, \u201cWith the suspension of parts procurement, this target is now largely unattainable.\u201d (<em>The Information</em> <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/tesla-halts-robot-parts-purchase-pending-optimus-design-change\">confirmed</a> the report.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On his Q2 earnings call, Musk said that Tesla is now working on an Optimus 3 prototype. \u201cWe are gonna retool a bunch of things, so it\u2019s gonna probably be prototypes of Optimus 3 [at the] end of this year and then scale production next year,\u201d he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rosary of failures may explain why <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-optimus-humanoid-robot-program-head-exiting-firm-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-06-06/\">Optimus&#8217;s program chief, Milan Kovac, bolted in June</a>. Kovac left Tesla abruptly, citing family reasons (&#8220;I want to make it clear that this is the only reason,&#8221; he insisted on social media). The project is now in the hands of Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot boss, Ashok Elluswamy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some old-design Optimus robots are currently in Tesla factories doing limited jobs. The company has shown the robots performing specific tasks, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CAD895Nk7xA\">folding a T-shirt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hKV2RBuOKPU\">moving batteries</a> at glacial speeds. Musk also recently reposted a video of an Optimus <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1946730635516899502?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1946730635516899502%7Ctwgr%5Ef082710e6d0f535bc84ed8f0fad76a853166ff55%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Ftechnology%2Ftech-news%2Felon-musks-tesla-optimus-humanoid-robot-serving-popcorn-goes-viral-says-this-will-become-normal-in-a-few-years%2Farticleshow%2F122810959.cms\">serving popcorn</a> at the new Tesla Diner in Hollywood, though the clip is speeded up, giving the impression that the robot functions at a normal pace.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Jetsons</em>-esque diner, which houses a Supercharger station, is a smokescreen, detonated the day before the company&#8217;s Q2 results and meant to distract from yet another empty promise: Musk hasn\u2019t yet delivered batteries that load as fast as gas pumps, so he\u2019s now inviting drivers to fill up on pancakes and burgers while waiting for their cars to charge. The popcorn-serving Optimus, meanwhile, is a prop used by the company to distract fans and investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-magnet-size-problem\">A MAGNET-SIZE PROBLEM</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimus\u2019s problems run deep, starting with the rare-earth magnets it needs to power its motors. Without the magnets, there\u2019s no way to make robots that can move with the speed and precision of real humans. While Tesla hasn\u2019t disclosed the number of magnets the Optimus requires, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rare-earth-metals-next-high-155500203.html\">analyst Luke Lango says</a> it may use up to 8 pounds of magnets. (A typical humanoid robot needs more than 40 servo motors, and each of those requires up to 3.5 ounces of magnets.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/23/teslas-optimus-hit-by-chinas-rare-earth-restrictions-says-musk.html\">Back in March</a>, Musk blamed Optimus\u2019s manufacturing problems on the lack of rare-earth magnets. Beijing had canceled exports when Musk&#8217;s former best buddy declared a trade war against China. In June, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/business/china-rare-earth-licensing.html#:~:text=Progress%20With%20E.U.-,Before%20Talks%20With%20U.S.,requirements%20introduced%20two%20months%20ago.\">resumed issuing permits</a> for rare-earth magnet exports, putting them on a short leash while <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3318865/china-cracks-down-rare-earth-smugglers-vowing-stronger-export-controls\">cracking down on smuggling</a>. But this is a problem that is not going to be solved anytime soon, if ever. As long as geopolitical tensions exist, no Western company can fully rely on Chinese magnets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91372632\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-1-91372600-elon-musk-humanoid-robots.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Image: Tesla]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. government is trying to stop Chinese dominance by investing in MP Materials, an American company that just built a small magnet supply chain that\u2019s still in its embryonic state. To make the millions of magnets that Musk needs for Optimus to succeed at scale, Tesla would have to put itself at the front of the line, ahead of <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/21/rare-earth-magnets-china-exports-surge.html#:~:text=Chinese%20rare%2Dearth%20magnet%20producers,required%20to%20secure%20export%20licenses.\">everyone</a> from carmakers to gadget peddlers, including Apple (which itself <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-expands-us-supply-chain-with-500-million-usd-commitment/\">bought into</a> the MP Materials pipe dream this month). Such a supply chain will be very hard to build and could disintegrate at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-designed-to-fail\">DESIGNED TO FAIL?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if\u2014and that is a Starship-size if\u2014Tesla manages to secure a steady supply chain to scale up production to the levels that Musk needs, Optimus&#8217;s design may be doomed from the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla is chasing the hardest form factor in robotics, humanoids, without lidar, which means its robots will encounter the same issues that plague the company&#8217;s Full Self-Driving mode and Robotaxi. While Musk claims that lidar is for losers, the exclusive use of regular cameras has proven insufficient to understand the world around cars, leading to accidents. (From 2019 to 2023, Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot was involved in <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a44185487/report-tesla-autopilot-crashes-since-2019/\">736 crashes</a>, including 17 <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/tesla-highest-rate-deadly-accidents-study-1235176092/\">fatal ones</a>. And that\u2019s without counting the near-misses and car bumper accidents.) It will be the same with robots, which is why many of Tesla&#8217;s rivals, including startups like Unitree and AgiBot, are leaning on proven sensor stacks.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even then, the humanoid form factor may not be right in some settings. Chris Walti, Tesla&#8217;s first Optimus lead, who left in 2022 to found the non-humanoid <a href=\"https://mytra.ai/\">robotics startup Mytra</a>, recently <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/teslas-first-optimus-lead-doubts-about-elon-musks-robot-dream-2025-5#:~:text=robot%2C%20said%20humanoid%20robots%20like%20Optimus%20were%20the%20wrong%20option%20for%20factory%20work&amp;text=Walt%20said%20the%20human%20form%20%22evolved%20to%20escape%20wolves%20and%20bears.\">argued</a> that human-shaped robots are &#8220;the wrong option for factory work&#8221; because the human form &#8220;evolved to escape wolves and bears,\u201d rather than perform repetitive industrial tasks, making it a \u201csuboptimal system.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91372653\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-3-91372600-elon-musk-humanoid-robots.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A Tesla Optimus robot scoops popcorn and gestures at customers during the opening of the Tesla Diner in Hollywood on July 21, 2025.

Fallon/AFP/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality today is that specialized, purpose-built automation consistently outperforms general-purpose humanoid robots in cost, reliability, and efficiency for industrial tasks. That makes Tesla&#8217;s approach both an expensive engineering exercise and one that may lack a viable business strategy. Unless Optimus mutates into something tougher, easier to make, and a lot cheaper (Unitree\u2019s model has a $16,000 price tag), it\u2019s destined to remain a showroom tease for a long time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apptronik\u2019s Cardenas is still bullish on humanoids, which he argues can one day be deployed to perform a multitude of tasks. (Most bots today are created for single purposes.) &#8220;My view is that the key thing for robotics to scale is versatility,\u201d he says, noting his belief that we will someday see humanoids everywhere in the world, both legged and wheeled. Investors seem to agree. Financing for the sector has been growing wildly, especially in China, where the humanoid robot industry is most advanced. There, total funding <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3319018/china-robotics-firm-unitree-eyes-ipo-filing-year-industry-starts-commercialise\">reached $4.4 billion</a> as of July 2025, doubling the previous year\u2019s high-water mark, according to data from ITjuzi, which tracks China\u2019s venture-capital market.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On July 21, <a href=\"https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/jdcom-leads-funding-in-spirit-ai-limx-dynamics-engine-ai-to-advance-embodied-intelligence\">Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com unveiled investments</a> in three Chinese robotics startups: Engine AI, LimX Dynamics, and Spirit AI. Meanwhile, Hangzhou-based Unitree reached unicorn status in June with a new funding round that valued it at <a href=\"https://theaiinsider.tech/2025/06/20/chinese-robotics-company-unitree-robotics-valued-at-1-4-billion-after-series-c-funding-round/\">more than $1.3 billion</a>. Investors included Alibaba Group Holding and affiliate Ant Group; Tencent Holdings; China Mobile; carmaker Geely; and Jinqiu Capital, an investment firm founded by former <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/tiktok\" title=\"TikTok\">ByteDance</a> employees.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of these Chinese companies are already lining up customers. Hong Kong-listed UBTech secured a $12.6 million purchase from state-owned car exporter MiEE (Shanghai) Automotive Technology, by far the <a href=\"https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3388185915555973\">largest deal in the humanoid industry</a>. Unitree and AgiBot also <a href=\"https://www.rockingrobots.com/china-mobile-places-largest-ever-humanoid-robot-order/\">struck deals with telecoms operator China Mobile</a>, worth $6.4 million and $10.9 million, respectively. Unitree founder and CEO Wang Xingxing said the company&#8217;s annual revenue had <a href=\"https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3353252936479360\">surpassed $139.4 million</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These deals are far from the trillions that Musk covets, but they are a clear signal that his company is behind. Three months ago, Musk promised an army of Optimus robots marching through Tesla factories by the end of the year. Looking at the current state of the project, his 100-million robot party is turning into the Fyre Festival of robotics.</p>\n\n\n<hr />",

    "description": "<p>A leader recently told me about her dilemma: Her top performer of four years was asking about advancement opportunities, but with frozen budgets and no open positions, she felt powerless to help. Sound familiar?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This scenario plays out everywhere. High performers hit their stride, ask &#8220;What&#8217;s next?&#8221; and managers default to the same answer: promotion. When that&#8217;s not possible, both sides feel stuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here&#8217;s what most leaders miss: When employees ask about advancement, they&#8217;re often asking for something deeper\u2014to be seen, valued, and recognized for their contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For decades, organizations have made promotion the primary symbol of professional success. It&#8217;s become our go-to way of saying &#8220;your work matters.&#8221; But this creates problems when budgets freeze: managers feel powerless, and employees feel invisible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution isn&#8217;t finding more money for promotions. It&#8217;s separating recognition from title changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-s-curve-of-growth-framework\">The S Curve of Growth Framework</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of thinking about career development as a ladder (up or nothing), I encourage leaders to think about it as a learning curve\u2014specifically, what I call the S Curve of Growth. Every skill, project, or responsibility follows this predictable S-shaped pattern:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Launch Point:</strong> You&#8217;re at the base of the S, where learning feels slow but you&#8217;re building crucial foundations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sweet Spot:</strong> The steep middle of the S, where you gain confidence and competence. Progress feels exponential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mastery:</strong> The top plateau of the S, where you&#8217;ve reached high performance but growth levels off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The S Curve of Growth gives you and your employees a shared language for career conversations. Instead of &#8220;I need a promotion,&#8221; the conversation becomes &#8220;I&#8217;m reaching mastery on my project management S Curve\u2014what new curve should I start climbing?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-making-this-work-in-practice\">Making This Work in Practice</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most effective leaders using this approach:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make development ongoing, not annual.</strong> Replace yearly reviews with regular check-ins. Ask employees where they see themselves on different learning curves and what support they need to progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let employees drive their growth.</strong> Using the S Curve framework, stop dictating development paths. Ask: &#8220;Which of your S Curves do you want to accelerate? What new curve interests you?&#8221; Then create opportunities around their answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recognize progress publicly.</strong> Acknowledge when someone moves from struggling with a new system to training others on it. Call out when they take on a challenging project. Make their growth visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-bottom-line\">The Bottom Line</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Growth doesn&#8217;t require promotions. A software developer can master new programming languages, mentor junior colleagues, or lead cross-functional projects\u2014all without a title change. A <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketing</a> manager can expand into data analytics, build vendor relationships, or develop content strategy expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you help employees map their growth across multiple S Curves, you solve two problems: they feel recognized and engaged, and you build a more versatile, capable team. Everyone wins, even when the org chart stays frozen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question isn&#8217;t whether you can afford to promote everyone. It&#8217;s whether you can afford to not help them grow.</p>",

She\u2019d recently adopted <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> to streamline workflows and free up time for more strategic work. But in the exit interview, the employee shared something she hadn\u2019t expected: he felt unseen, disconnected, and undervalued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of her managers went even further\u2014using <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/389e505c-a1cc-4176-a592-dd1d0fa171b8\">AI-generated scripts</a> for everything from difficult feedback to performance check-ins, and even praise.\u00a0 The messages felt impersonal, disconnected, and inauthentic. Employees took note. Even if <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/productivity\" title=\"Productivity\">productivity</a> increased, effectiveness took a dive. One top performer began to disengage and soon gave notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For busy leaders, automating conversations with team members can bring a sense of relief. Plug in a prompt. Let the machine guide the 1:1. However, when we offload the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/emotional-labor\">emotional labor</a> of leadership, we risk eroding trust and connection, the very foundations that make teams thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI can be a <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work\">game changer</a> for managers, but only when it\u2019s used to amplify the human side of leadership. Too often, tools designed to save time end up weakening connection and culture. The opportunity isn\u2019t just to use AI. It\u2019s to use it well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-leading-effectively-with-ai-nbsp\">Leading Effectively with AI&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the proper <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91124670/ai-guardrails-will-they-protect-or-paralyze\">guardrails</a>, AI can expand a manager\u2019s capacity, freeing them up to lead with more empathy, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91161761/how-to-communicate-like-youre-the-boss\">presence</a>, and purpose. Think of AI as your backstage partner, not your stand-in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This risk is especially real for <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2023/01/helping-gen-z-employees-find-their-place-at-work\">Gen Z</a> professionals<strong>, </strong>many of whom launched their careers remotely and hadn\u2019t, for a time, seen relational leadership modeled in person.

If we let AI handle the hard parts for them, like navigating conflict, building trust, or making tough calls, we miss the chance to develop the very capabilities they\u2019ll need when AI inevitably falls short or fails in a crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through our work advising dozens of companies facing these dynamics,<a href=\"https://www.kathrynlandisconsulting.com/\"> Kathryn,</a> as an executive coach and keynote speaker, and<a href=\"https://jennyfernandez.com/\"> Jenny,</a> as an executive adviser and learning &amp; development expert, have identified four strategies to help managers embrace AI in ways to make them more strategic, effective, and human-centered.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-know-what-to-automate-and-what-needs-you\">1. Know What to Automate\u2014and What Needs You</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As generative AI becomes more embedded in day-to-day workflows, leaders must guide their managers in determining which tasks should be automated and which demand human judgment and emotional intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is well-suited for structured, repeatable tasks: generating first drafts of reports, summarizing meeting notes, preparing talking points, or reviewing written communication for tone and clarity. These applications<strong> </strong>reduce cognitive load and free up time for more meaningful work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But AI falls short in moments that require discernment, empathy, or trust-building. It cannot read between the lines of disengagement, coach a direct report who\u2019s questioning their fit on the team, or navigate a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91369251/how-to-avoid-getting-ambushed-in-a-high-stakes-meeting\">high-stakes conversation</a> that touches on identity, like feeling excluded, overlooked, or underestimated. Delegating these responsibilities to a tool, even one that appears well-crafted, risks eroding a team\u2019s <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2022/12/a-guide-to-building-psychological-safety-on-your-team\">psychological safety</a> and your leadership credibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use AI to clear space, not to take your place. We helped Lisa\u2019s team draft a simple guide to distinguish what to automate and what to lead directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to Automate vs. Where to Show Up</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Use AI for\u2026</strong></td><td><strong>Show up as a leader when..</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Summarizing reports or meeting notes</td><td>Delivering difficult feedback or navigating emotionally charged conversations</td></tr><tr><td>Reviewing written communication or organizing check-in agendas</td><td>Coaching someone through a new role, challenge, or career inflection point</td></tr><tr><td>Preparing performance review drafts</td><td>Celebrating wins or recognizing great work</td></tr><tr><td>Analyzing team feedback or surfacing key themes from engagement data</td><td>Discussing concerns openly and cocreating solutions with the team</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Pro tip: Ask yourself: <em>Am I using AI to enhance my leadership, or to avoid the parts that feel uncomfortable?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-show-your-team-what-good-ai-use-looks-like\">2. Show Your Team What Good AI Use Looks Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want AI to be used well, your team has to see what \u201cwell\u201d looks like. That starts at the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managers take their cues from what leaders say <em>and</em> what they do. When Lisa began introducing AI into her team\u2019s workflows, she focused on implementation, but hadn\u2019t yet modeled how to use it thoughtfully. Her managers saw the tools being used for speed and scale, but not as an enabler for coaching, collaboration, or deeper thinking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent coaching session, Lisa reflected that she had unintentionally created a culture of quiet experimentation\u2014without guidance, feedback, or clarity about what <em>effective </em>AI use looked like. We encouraged her to share her learning process with her direct reports: where she was experimenting, where she\u2019d made mistakes, and where she saw potential.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began demoing use cases with her team, inviting feedback, and normalizing discomfort. That shift, from quiet adoption to visible shared learning, sparked more thoughtful, responsible AI use across her team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are three ways you can do the same with your team:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Share your learning journey.</strong> Be open about where you\u2019re experimenting and what you\u2019re still figuring out.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Frame AI as an enabler.</strong> Position it as a way to work smarter and lead with greater focus and presence.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Create psychological safety.</strong> Encourage your team to try, fail, and learn without fear of judgment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with great modeling, boundaries matter. Without clear guardrails, AI can quietly start doing the parts of leadership that should never be outsourced.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-draw-the-line-between-support-and-substitution\">3. Draw the Line Between Support and Substitution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When expectations are vague, AI can slowly shift from a helpful assistant to a leadership shortcut. We\u2019ve seen managers start by using it to draft talking points, only to lean on it later for delivering feedback or handling conflict. The tone may be polished, but the message often lacks the personalization and presence. People notice, and over time, trust erodes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaders must help their teams set clear boundaries. AI can help structure a message, but it shouldn\u2019t deliver it for you, especially when the moment calls for empathy, vulnerability, or moral courage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research from <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/press/new-mit-sloan-research-suggests-ai-more-likely-to-complement-not-replace-human-workers\">MIT Sloan</a> reinforces this distinction: while AI excels at structured, transactional tasks, it\u2019s significantly less effective in emotionally nuanced situations, such as coaching, conflict resolution, or performance feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is especially important for middle managers, who play a critical role in developing Gen Z professionals. Many early-career employees are still building <a href=\"https://corporate.britishcouncil.org/insights/gen-z-workplace-bridging-soft-skills-gap-drive-success\">confidence</a> through live, relational interactions and will take their cues from what is modeled. When managers default to AI prompts, they not only weaken their own impact, but also risk sending the message that presence is optional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A useful rule of thumb: If a conversation could shape how someone feels about their value, performance, or belonging; it needs to be human-led.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As AI tools become more capable, drawing the line between support and substitution will become one of the defining responsibilities of modern leadership.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-help-managers-use-saved-time-strategically\">4. Help Managers Use Saved Time Strategically</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of AI\u2019s biggest benefits is time. But without a clear plan, that reclaimed time is often consumed by low-value meetings, inbox clutter, or busywork. The risk isn\u2019t just wasted hours. It\u2019s wasted opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Help managers use their freed-up capacity with intention. Encourage them to reinvest it in what matters most: mentoring team members, building culture, thinking strategically, or developing their own <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/future-of-jobs-report-2025-jobs-of-the-future-and-the-skills-you-need-to-get-them/\">leadership skills</a>. These are the high-leverage activities that often fall by the wayside, but make the biggest difference over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask yourself:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Where is your time most valuable, and how are you protecting it?&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What high-impact conversations are you putting off, and why?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In what ways could you invest this time to grow your team, or yourself?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Pro tip:\u00a0Use time by design, not by default.\u00a0 When time is freed, leaders have a choice: fill it by default, or use it by design.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-better-way-to-lead-with-ai\">A Better Way to Lead with AI</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lisa began modeling her own learning, setting clearer boundaries, and making space for reflection. She stopped simply asking what her managers were automating, and started asking why. That shift helped her to rebuild trust, reconnect with her team, and lead with focus. Ultimately, the most significant impact of AI wasn\u2019t speed. It was presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI will continue to shape how we lead, communicate, and make decisions. But leadership has never been just about efficiency. It\u2019s about discernment, trust, and showing up fully for the moments that matter. The best leaders won\u2019t only ask, \u201cHow can I use AI?\u201d They\u2019ll ask, \u201cHow is my use of AI impacting the people I lead?\u201d\u00a0 The future of leadership isn\u2019t a choice between human or machine. It\u2019s human\u2014you bringing yourself to the job, with AI as your copilot.</p>",

    "description": "<p>More than a decade ago, Pramod Sharma set out to make learning more engaging. Through <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> and computer vision, his startup <a href=\"https://www.playosmo.com/en-US/\">Osmo</a> transformed iPad apps into hands-on experiences, letting kids use puzzle pieces and other physical objects to solve spelling and math problems on screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a lot of fun\u2014until Osmo grew, and Sharma\u2019s role shifted from inventing to managing. Meetings, PowerPoint decks, endless email threads took over. \u201cAt some point, you become a manager, and you spend a lot of time in communication,\u201d Sharma tells <em>Fast Company</em>. \u201cWe realized a lot of our communication wasn\u2019t fun.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Sharma and a few colleagues left Osmo four years ago, they decided to tackle that problem. The result is <a href=\"https://www.napkin.ai/\">Napkin</a>, a web app that uses generative AI to turn text and numbers into flow charts, diagrams, and other visuals. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a graphic designer, you don\u2019t need to be a visual thinker,\u201d Sharma says. \u201cOur vision is to democratize visuals for everyone.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One year into its open beta, Napkin has surpassed five million registered users. Now, the company is preparing to monetize while staying true to the lessons learned from Osmo\u2014chief among them: keep things light and approachable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur users really love the fact that it\u2019s playful,\u201d Sharma says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-text-to-visuals-with-the-help-of-ai\">From Text to Visuals, with the Help of AI</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Napkin\u2019s experience <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91178294/napkin-is-a-great-new-ai-tool-for-making-quick-visuals\">starts with a screen</a> that resembles a page from a school notebook. Users paste or write text, highlight the key parts, hit a magic button, and the app generates several draft visuals to help communicate the core ideas and numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These visuals can be edited to highlight specific phrases or match a company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/branding\" title=\"Branding\">branding</a>. \u201cWhen we started, we had this mindset that we wanted to push for a certain style,\u201d Sharma says. \u201cNow, we think of Napkin as a tool. Editing is a big part of that.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as important is <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90954034/why-napkin-is-a-great-app-for-gathering-and-exploring-your-ideas\">keeping the interface fun</a>. \u201cTraditionally, business products don\u2019t tend to be fun,\u201d Sharma says. \u201cI used to think [that\u2019s] because the boring stuff sells.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Napkin, Sharma wanted to try something different, starting with a frictionless onboarding experience. It\u2019s a lesson drawn directly from Osmo. Kids, Sharma points out, won\u2019t tolerate complexity. \u201cIf they don\u2019t intuitively get it, they don\u2019t want to play,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Osmo, Napkin encourages learning by doing. \u201cWe have no tutorial,\u201d Sharma says. \u201cThat thinking comes from games.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This hands-on approach also supports global adoption. Sixty percent of Napkin\u2019s users don\u2019t speak English, and the service supports dozens of languages. \u201cSouth Korea is a big market for us,\u201d Sharma says. \u201cJapan is a huge market for us.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until now, Napkin has been free to use during its open beta. Soon, the company will introduce two paid subscription tiers, alongside a free plan. It has also started previewing API access for developers and companies looking to integrate the tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-more-than-just-a-powerpoint-replacement\">More Than Just a PowerPoint Replacement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The rise of generative AI has been a major advantage for Napkin. Sharma calls large language models a \u201chuge accelerator.\u201d But with that comes higher expectations, especially for visuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUsers have a high bar for AI,\u201d Sharma says. \u201cYou can\u2019t get away with 70 percent.\u201d People may settle for rough graphics when making them on their own, but expect professional-grade output from AI. \u201cAn Apple keynote, or a TED talk: They want AI to get to that level,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharma doesn\u2019t see Napkin as just a better slide tool. \u201cIt\u2019s not just to build a better slide deck,\u201d he says. He wants <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketers</a>, executives, and creators to tap into their visual creativity\u2014something he compares to learning a new language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBefore I went to college, I did not speak English at all,\u201d says Sharma, who was born in India. \u201cMy family didn\u2019t speak. I was in a small town. But once I went to college and started learning English, it opened my world in a very significant way.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same, he argues, can happen with visual communication. \u201cWhat you think about new ideas changes,\u201d he says.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Ten years ago, just months after announcing his presidential campaign, Donald Trump called sky-high CEO pay \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d telling <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/13/donald-trump-on-ceo-pay-its-disgraceful/\">CBS\u2019s <em>Face the Nation</em> in 2015</a>: \u201cYou see these guys making enormous amounts of money, and it&#8217;s a total and complete joke.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, average CEO pay\u2014and the gap between it and median worker pay\u2014has <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90946788/out-of-control-ceo-pay-why-its-a-problem\">grown even more</a>. And as president, Trump&#8217;s policies are making that inequality even worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The average CEO-to-worker-pay ratio for S&amp;P 500 Index companies in 2024 was 285 to 1, according to the AFL-CIO\u2019s <a href=\"https://aflcio.org/paywatch\">annual Executive Paywatch report</a>\u2014an increase from 268 to 1 in 2023.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, as Americans fretted about the rising costs of eggs and housing, and the way they felt the country\u2019s economy was leaving them behind, the average CEO of an S&amp;P 500 company saw an average pay increase of $1.24 million. In 2024, the CEOs at those companies received $18.9 million in total compensation, up 7% from the year prior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax cuts in Trump\u2019s \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d are set to increase CEO take-home pay even more. Each CEO is set to get about $500,000 back from those tax cuts; all together, the CEOs of the publicly traded companies in the AFL-CIO\u2019s Executive Paywatch database will see a combined $738 million in income tax savings. Meanwhile, that bill has severely cut funds for government services like Medicare health coverage, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, and school lunches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AFL-CIO is a 70-year-old federation of more than 60 unions, representing 15 million-plus workers. It is highlighting CEO pay through this report to note how \u201cthe system is obviously broken,\u201d Fred Redmond, AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer, said in a press conference. \u201cWorkers really have one concern in mind: They just want to share in the benefits and profits that they help to create every day. And the 285-to-1 ratio is not fair compensation to the workers.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skyrocketing CEO pay isn\u2019t a recent issue; the gap between what a CEO takes home and what an average worker earns has been widening for years. Looking at the S&amp;P Index specifically, the average CEO compensation package increased $6.5 million in the past decade alone, the report notes. In 1965, the pay ratio between CEOs and average workers <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90946788/out-of-control-ceo-pay-why-its-a-problem\">was 20 to 1</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The median annual wage for workers in the U.S. across all industries was just $49,500 in 2024. At that wage, a worker would need to have been working since 1740 to earn what the average S&amp;P 500 CEO took home in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, CEO-to-worker-pay ratios also vary by <a href=\"https://aflcio.org/paywatch/highest-paid-ceos\">individual company</a>. In 2024, Starbucks\u2019s new CEO, Brian Niccol, received upwards of $95 million in total compensation. That puts Starbucks\u2019s CEO-to-median-worker-pay ratio at 6,666 to 1. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella earned $79 million in 2024, for a ratio of 408 to 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with cutting taxes for high earners, the Trump administration is considering no longer requiring this information be publicly disclosed to investors. In 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule requiring CEO-to-worker-pay ratio disclosures (that requirement didn\u2019t go into effect until 2017).\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Trump\u2019s SEC chair, Paul Atkins, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/05/16/trump-sec-ceo-compensation-disclosure-atkins-roundtable/\">has said</a> that rules around executive compensation disclosure have grown \u201cincreasingly complex and lengthy,\u201d and is reportedly considering loosening disclosure requirements, including around executive perks like the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91176910/environmental-impact-of-the-starbucks-ceos-supercommute\">personal use of corporate jets</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AFL-CIO is advocating for those disclosure requirements to remain as they are. \u201cIn our view, sunlight is the best disinfectant to prevent CEO pay, waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d Redmond said, \u201cand we are urging visitors to the Executive Paywatch website to tell the SEC the importance of CEO pay disclosure.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<hr />",

Sign up for <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/newsletters/briefweekly/\">The Brief Weekly</a> to get up to speed on their essential coverage of Texas issues.</p>\n\n            \n\n                \n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n                    \n<p>One day in late May 2024, lawyer Zina Bash spent 6 1/2 hours working on a case against Facebook parent company Meta on behalf of the state of Texas. She reviewed draft legal filings. She participated in a court-ordered mediation session and then discussed the outcome with state Attorney General Ken Paxton.</p>\n\n<p>In her previous job as senior counsel on Paxton\u2019s leadership team, that labor would have cost Texas taxpayers $641.</p>\n\n<p>But Bash had moved to private practice. Paxton hired her firm to work on the Meta case, allowing her to bill $3,780 an hour, so that day of work will cost taxpayers $24,570.</p>\n\n<p>In the past five years, Paxton has grown increasingly reliant on pricey private lawyers to argue cases on behalf of the state, rather than the hundreds of attorneys who work within his office, an investigation by The Texas Tribune and ProPublica found. These are often attorneys, like Bash, with whom Paxton has personal or political ties.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to Bash, one such contract went to Tony Buzbee, the trial lawyer who successfully defended Paxton during his 2023 impeachment trial on corruption charges. Three other contracts went to firms whose senior attorneys have donated to Paxton\u2019s political campaigns. Despite these connections and what experts say are potential conflicts of interest, Paxton does not appear to have recused himself from the selection process. Although he is not required to by law, this raises a concern about appearing improper, experts who study attorneys general said.</p>\n\n<p>Paxton appears to have also outsourced cases more frequently than his predecessors, available records show. And he\u2019s inked the kind of contingent-fee contracts, in which firms receive a share of a settlement if they win, far more often than the attorneys general in other large states, including California, New York and Pennsylvania. Since 2015, the New York and California attorneys general have awarded zero contingent-fee contracts; Pennsylvania\u2019s has signed one. During that period, Paxton\u2019s office approved 13.</p>\n\n<p>One of those was with Bash\u2019s firm, Chicago-based Keller Postman, at the time known as Keller Lenkner, which she joined as partner in February 2021 after resigning from her job at the attorney general\u2019s office. Paxton had signed a contract with the company two months earlier to investigate Google for deceptive business practices and violations of antitrust law. A little more than a year later, Bash\u2019s firm won a state contract to work on the Meta litigation, alleging its facial recognition software violated Texans\u2019 privacy. This time, Bash was the co-lead counsel.</p>\n\n<p>Meta, which called the <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/14/paxton-facebook-privacy-lawsuit/\">lawsuit</a> meritless, settled the case for $1.4 billion in the summer of 2024. It was a windfall for Keller Postman. The firm billed $97 million, the largest fee charged by outside counsel under Paxton\u2019s tenure. Bash\u2019s work alone accounted for $3.6 million of that total.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            A letter from Zina Bash to the Texas attorney general\u2019s office informs the office that the state owes her firm, Keller Postman, almost $97 million for its work on the state\u2019s case against Meta.\n    \n            (Obtained by The Texas Tribune. Highlighted by ProPublica.)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Bash, a former U.S. Supreme Court clerk, said in a statement she is honored the attorney general\u2019s office partnered with Keller Postman based on the firm\u2019s \u201cfirst-rate attorneys and extensive experience.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe have a record of taking on the most significant litigation in the country against the most powerful defendants in the world,\u201d Bash said.</p>\n\n<p>Keller Postman did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>There is little to stop Paxton, or any other occupant of his office, from handing these contracts out. The attorney general can award them without seeking bids from other law firms or asking anyone\u2019s permission.</p>\n\n<p>Asked to provide competitive-bid documents for the contingent-fee contracts it has awarded, the attorney general\u2019s office said it had none because state law \u201cexempts the OAG from having to do all of the solicitation steps when hiring outside counsel.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Given the high-profile nature of representing an attorney general and the potential for a big payday, many qualified firms would be eager to compete for this work, said Paul Nolette, a professor of political science at Marquette University who studies attorneys general.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be curious to know what the justification is for this not going on the open market,\u201d Nolette said.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Paxton declined interview requests for this story. He has publicly defended the practice of hiring outside law firms, arguing that his office lacks the resources in-house to take on massive corporations like tech companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese parties have practically unlimited resources that would swamp most legal teams and delay effective enforcement,\u201d Paxton told the Senate finance committee during a budget hearing in January.</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for Paxton said in a statement that the outside lawyers hired by the office are some of the best in the nation. With the contingent-fee settlements to date, more than $2 billion, the state \u201ccould not have gotten a better return on its investment,\u201d the statement said.</p>\n\n<p>Chris Toth, former executive director of the National Association of Attorneys General, questioned why so much extra help is needed. Outside counsel is appropriate for small states, he said, that \u201conly have so many lawyers with so many levels of expertise.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Texas attorney general\u2019s office, one of the largest in the country, has more than 700 attorneys.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLarge states typically don\u2019t hire outside counsel,\u201d Toth said. \u201cThey should have the people in-house that should be able to go toe-to-toe with the best attorneys that are out there.\u201d</p>\n\nA Troubled History\n<p>When a Texas attorney general previously made a practice of giving lucrative contracts to private counsel, it didn\u2019t end well.</p>\n\n<p>Dan Morales was the last Democrat to hold the office. He became embroiled in scandal after he used outside firms to help secure a $17 billion settlement in Big Tobacco litigation in 1998.</p>\n\n<p>Republicans, including then-Gov. George W. Bush, blasted the $3.2 billion payout to the outside lawyers as exorbitant. Their attacks grew more intense when Morales sought to steer $500 million of that sum to a lawyer, a personal friend, who did very little work on the case. Morales pleaded guilty in 2003 to related federal corruption charges. He served 3 1/2 years behind bars.</p>\n\n<p>John Cornyn, the Republican who succeeded Morales in 1999, criticized his predecessor\u2019s handling of the tobacco case during his campaign for the office. In an interview for this story, Cornyn said he never hired outside counsel as attorney general because he focused on recruiting talented in-house lawyers that he felt could handle all the office\u2019s cases.</p>\n\n<p>Paxton is challenging Cornyn, now a four-term U.S. senator, in next year\u2019s Republican primary.</p>\n\n<p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican who led the office after Cornyn, appears to have rarely used private lawyers. The attorney general\u2019s office was able to produce records for only part of Abbott\u2019s 12-year term because state law allows the files to be deleted after so many years. The office signed nine outside counsel contracts between 2010 and 2014, all pro bono or for hourly rates rather than contingency. Abbott did not respond to an interview request.</p>\n\n<p>Paxton also seldom outsourced cases during his first five years in office. Through 2019, he awarded only nine outside counsel contracts, all pro bono or hourly rate. The most expensive contract capped fees at $500,000 \u2014\u00a0far less than $143 million the state paid to the two firms, including Bash\u2019s, that handled the Meta case.</p>\n\n<p>He changed course in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>That summer, the attorney general\u2019s office was gearing up to file its first case against Google. It related to allegations that the company monopolized the online advertising market, raising costs for advertisers, who increased the price of their products for average consumers as a result. Paxton initially had no plans to hire outside counsel for the litigation, three former deputy attorneys general told the Tribune and ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>But before the case was filed, the attorney general\u2019s office was thrown into upheaval. At the end of September, seven of Paxton\u2019s senior advisers reported him to the FBI, concerned his relationship with an Austin real estate investor had crossed the line into bribery and corruption. State House members would later impeach Paxton on counts related to the accusations; state senators eventually acquitted him. The federal criminal investigation into Paxton did not result in any criminal charges.</p>\n\n<p>Over fall 2020, each of the lawyers in his office who had accused Paxton of wrongdoing quit or was fired. That included Darren McCarty, the head of civil litigation who was supposed to lead the Google litigation before he reported his boss to the FBI. He resigned on Oct. 26.</p>\n\n<p>Less than two months later, on Dec. 16, Paxton signed contracts with The Lanier Law Firm and Keller Postman to investigate Google. They filed the lawsuit against the tech giant in federal court the same day.</p>\n\n<p>Paxton replaced the lawyers who complained to the authorities. The staffing of the antitrust and consumer protection divisions, which would have handled these cases, remained constant at more than 80 employees in the following years. Yet Paxton continued to outsource lawsuits against large corporations to private lawyers.</p>\n\n<p>Under Keller Postman\u2019s contract, the firm would be paid only if it secured a settlement or won at trial. These contingent-fee cases have the potential to be far more profitable for the outside firms than those in which they bill at a regular hourly rate. In a successful case, the contracts say that firms are paid either a percentage of a settlement or the sum of hours billed by the firm times four, whichever is less.</p>\n\n<p>In the Meta case, Keller Postman was entitled to 11% of the state\u2019s settlement, a share that totaled $154 million. But because the firm\u2019s fees and expenses totaled $97 million, it billed that sum.</p>\n\n<p>In multiple legislative sessions, Paxton has testified that outsourcing was the only way his office could stand toe-to-toe with corporate titans.</p>\n\n<p>If Paxton has a shortage of qualified in-house attorneys, Cornyn told the newsrooms, that\u2019s because of the damage the whistleblower scandal did to the reputation of the attorney general\u2019s office as a home for ambitious young lawyers.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a victim of his own malfeasance and mismanagement because people did not want to work for him anymore,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cAnd if you run off your best lawyers because you engage in questionable ethical conduct, then you\u2019re left with very few options. But this shouldn\u2019t be a way to reward bad behavior.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Former Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard said he was surprised Paxton began hiring contingent-fee outside lawyers only after the scandal, since those contracts, with their potential for high profits, are tougher to ethically defend.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI would have thought it would have been the other way around \u2014 that he got more careful after he got the whistle blown on him,\u201d said Goddard, a Democrat. \u201cBut it looked like he got more reckless.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Attorney General Ken Paxton, right, sits with lawyer Tony Buzbee on the ninth day of Paxton\u2019s\u2019s impeachment trial at the Texas Capitol in Austin on Sept. 15, 2023.\n    \n            (Julius Shieh/The Texas Tribune)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \nConnections to Contract Recipients\n<p>Paxton\u2019s style of procurement also benefited Buzbee, the man who successfully defended him during his impeachment trial, which stemmed from allegations the whistleblowers raised.</p>\n\n<p>The attorney general chose to skip most of the proceedings, so for the 10 days of trial in the Texas Senate, his most vociferous advocate was the loquacious Buzbee. The pair sat side by side when the attorney general did attend.</p>\n\n<p>A little more than a year later, Paxton hired The Buzbee Law Firm to pursue an antitrust suit against the investment firms BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard that accuses the companies of manipulating the coal market in a way that allegedly increased electricity prices for Texans. The firms deny wrongdoing.</p>\n\n<p>Buzbee is a successful litigator and one of Houston\u2019s most famous plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. Among other victories, he won settlements for victims of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and $73 million for Gulf of Mexico oil drillers in a 2001 antitrust case. But he\u2019s known primarily for personal injury work, not antitrust litigation.</p>\n\n<p>His firm, one of two hired for this latest attorney general\u2019s office contingent-fee case, could collect 10% of any judgment or settlement. The case is in its early stages, though the Trump administration in May filed a brief in the case in support of Texas.</p>\n\n<p>Buzbee downplayed the potential for a big payday in an email to the newsrooms and argued there is no buddy system at play, noting he believed other law firms also interviewed with Paxton\u2019s office for the job. (The attorney general\u2019s office did not confirm this.) He said his firm has to pay for significant expenses up front, without any guarantee of payment.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe current arrangement may be a good deal for other lawyers, but in all candor, it\u2019s not for me,\u201d Buzbee said, adding that his normal hourly rate is $2,250. \u201cFrankly, the only reason I\u2019m even doing it is that I am proud to represent the state in such a landmark case.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            A page from an outside counsel contract, signed by both Buzbee and Paxton, shows The Buzbee Law Firm was hired to represent the state in litigation against BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp. and The Vanguard Group Inc.\n    \n            (Obtained by The Texas Tribune)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The connections between Paxton and the lawyers he has hired also extend to other firms. The attorney general\u2019s office hired the firm Norton Rose Fulbright, one of the largest in the country with more than 3,000 lawyers on staff, to work on separate Google cases for the state, focusing on consumer protection allegations.</p>\n\n<p>The attorney general\u2019s office has awarded three contracts to the firm since 2022 for cases against the tech giant. Three times during that period, Joseph Graham, the firm\u2019s lead counsel on the Google litigation, contributed $5,000 to Paxton\u2019s campaign for attorney general. Twice, the donations came within 16 days of Graham signing one of the firm\u2019s contracts with the attorney general.</p>\n\n<p>The firm and its attorneys have contributed $39,500 to Paxton\u2019s campaign since he took office. Neither Graham nor Norton Rose Fulbright responded to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Mark Lanier, founder of The Lanier Law Firm, which the state hired to work on a separate Google case, is a large donor to Texas elected officials. He has contributed $31,000 to Paxton\u2019s campaigns since 2015. The largest contribution, for $25,000, came six months after Lanier signed his firm\u2019s Google contract. </p>\n\n<p>The Lanier contract is slightly different from the others the attorney general\u2019s office awarded, in that the firm\u2019s payment is partially based on a basic hourly rate but it could also be paid more if it wins the case, as in the contingent-fee model. Lanier noted in an emailed statement to the newsrooms that he took a reduced fee on this case and maintained that the attorney general\u2019s office needed the kind of firepower his team can bring against an opponent like Google.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Texas AG office and its lawyers are good, but specialists are needed in a war like this.  And it is a war,\u201d Lanier wrote. \u201cIt would be irresponsible to pursue Google on behalf of Texans without bring[ing] the fullest resources you can.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A competitive, open process for awarding contracts can be a strong defense against accusations of favoritism, Goddard said.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike some other states, Texas does not require these contracts be put out to competitive bid.</p>\n\n<p>Florida, for example, has one of the most robust laws in the country for procuring outside counsel, requiring the attorney general to explain in writing why a contingent-fee contract is necessary. It also mandates most contracts be put out to competitive bid and caps contingent-fee payouts at $50 million.</p>\n\n<p>Texas has no such cap.</p>\n\n<p>It also has virtually no method for state lawmakers to truly supervise this kind of practice. State law mandates only that the attorney general notify the Legislature when his office awards a contingent-fee contract, and certify that no in-house lawyers or private attorneys at an hourly rate can handle the task. Paxton has done so in boilerplate two-page letters that all say outside attorneys are needed because of the \u201cscope and enormity\u201d of the cases.</p>\n\n<p>If lawmakers are concerned about these contracts, there is no mechanism for them to challenge Paxton\u2019s determination that private counsel is needed.</p>\n\n<p>Having lawyers bid for work would eliminate the appearance of impropriety that hangs over Paxton\u2019s hires, Goddard said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA couple look like paybacks, which is extraordinarily improper, in other words to award a contract to someone who\u2019s a major contributor or has recently left your office,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of those would not be allowed in our state.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Officials in other states have said they can still secure big wins for their constituents without relying on private firms.</p>\n\n<p>California, for example, reached a $93 million settlement with Google in 2023 over <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-announces-93-million-settlement-regarding-google%E2%80%99s\">claims</a> that the company was clandestinely tracking users\u2019 locations. A year earlier, in a case with similar allegations, Oregon and Nebraska led a 40-state coalition that won a $392 million settlement against the company. Texas was not part of this suit.</p>\n\n<p>The latter agreement required Google to make new privacy disclosures to consumers, restricted its ability to share users\u2019 location information with advertisers and required the company to prepare an annual report detailing how it was complying with the settlement terms.</p>\n\n<p>Doug Peterson, the Republican attorney general of Nebraska at the time, said negotiating the financial penalty \u2014 Nebraska\u2019s share was $11.9 million \u2014 was a secondary goal of the settlement.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe most important thing we\u2019re trying to do is to stop the bad behavior,\u201d Peterson said.</p>\n\n<p>McCarty, one of the attorney general employees who blew the whistle on Paxton, said private lawyers can be talented, but they have an incentive to fixate on the financial portion of settlements \u2014 which is tied to their compensation \u2014 rather than enforcement provisions that may best protect a state\u2019s residents.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGovernment enforcers, especially in the antitrust context, can focus on more effective solutions,\u201d McCarty said.</p>\n\n<p>Norton Rose Fulbright has yet to send its final billing records to the attorney general\u2019s office but is likely to be rewarded handsomely. The firm helped the state secure a $1.38 billion settlement with Google in May. Google spokesperson Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda said the Texas settlement, which has not been finalized, will contain no new restrictions on the company\u2019s practices.</p>\n\n<p>Under the terms of its contracts, the firm\u2019s fees could exceed $350 million.</p>",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91372556/what-happened-when-albuquerque-made-riding-its-buses-free",
    "description": "<p>Sabina Wohlmuth\u2019s days used to include long, hot walks across the city of Albuquerque, sometimes 2 or 3 miles at a time. Wohlmuth relies on the bus, but when she was short on cash, she walked instead of paying the fare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt was only a dollar for a one-way trip, but still, if you\u2019re homeless and you\u2019re poor that\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d Wohlmuth says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wohlmuth now takes the bus every day, to her job at McDonald\u2019s, to the store, and to the sober living facility where she stays. And each of those bus trips costs Wohlmuth zero dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Albuquerque made zero-fare transit permanent <a href=\"https://www.cabq.gov/transit/news/zero-fares-is-here-to-stay\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in November 2023</a>, becoming one of the largest U.S. cities to implement zero-fare transit. About a year and a half later, transit officials and advocates say the zero-fare program is working as intended, by serving the city\u2019s lowest-income residents. As some other midsize cities walk back their plans to make transit free, in Albuquerque the program is sticking around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is a public service, and the people we serve really rely on it,\u201d says Leslie Keener, director of the City of Albuquerque\u2019s transit department. \u201cI think it\u2019s a way to really just open up access and create mobility so that people have the opportunity to have some upward movement.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-mobility-for-survival\">Mobility for survival</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly 90% of Albuquerque\u2019s bus riders have household incomes of less than $35,000 per year, and a similar percentage don\u2019t have access to a vehicle. Making it easier for the city\u2019s lowest-income residents to get around is part of what Christopher Ramirez calls \u201cthe first purpose of public transit.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTransit equity is giving the people that are most in need the resources, and then build out\u201d other aspects of public transit, such as routes and frequency, says Ramirez, the cofounder and executive director of Together for Brothers. In 2017, the organization conducted a community health impact assessment that led to a focus on transit equity advocacy. Since 2019, the community organization has led a coalition to push for free transit in Albuquerque.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many bus riders in Albuquerque are experiencing homelessness, and rely on the bus to get to medical appointments, social service providers, work, and to visit friends and family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charles Battiste says he takes the bus every day. On a Wednesday in February, Battiste was riding the bus west on Central Avenue, the city\u2019s main thoroughfare, from a methadone treatment program to a hotel where he\u2019d recently secured temporary housing on the other side of town.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q, a 32-year-old who has been unhoused since they were 18, also rode the bus down Central Avenue&nbsp;that day in the opposite direction, to pick up some cough medicine at a hospital. Like Battiste, Q relies on the bus on a daily basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTransportation comes up frequently as one of the top barriers for our clients and those we serve in accessing healthcare, jobs, housing, all of the things that we know are the structural solutions to homelessness,\u201d says Rachel Biggs, chief strategy officer at Albuquerque Health Care for the Homeless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe know people in Albuquerque are stretched really thin, even the folks who aren\u2019t already .\u00a0.\u00a0. experiencing homelessness. The numbers of people living in poverty and who need transportation support just continue to grow, and we have a lot of transit-dependent residents.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biggs says her organization previously spent about $50,000 per year purchasing bus passes for clients so they could make appointments, look for housing, and get to work. This created a \u201creally cumbersome system\u201d that involved clients shuttling from the city\u2019s shelter on the far west side of town to Health Care for the Homeless\u2019s office early in the morning to pick up a free daily bus pass, then \u201cturning around and getting back on the bus\u201d to reach their destinations for the day. Monthly passes were less feasible because of the frequency that people experiencing homelessness lost their passes amid encampment sweeps, Biggs says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEspecially when you\u2019re experiencing homelessness, time is a very valuable resource,\u201d she says. \u201cSo to be able to get around town and not have to go through all the hoop-jumping, so that you can now hop on and hop off, it does increase access to all the services and all the things that someone would need to end their homelessness.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For other Albuquerque residents, free public transit serves as a lifeline, a vital mobility option when money is tight or other transportation falls through. One 67-year-old woman found herself on the bus after her car was repossessed due to difficulties making ends meet recently. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have something that\u2019s free, when you\u2019ve always driven, you\u2019ve always paid insurance, and you pay for almost everything,\u201d she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Erica Grier, who works as a part-time caregiver and uses a Section 8 voucher to afford housing, uses the bus every day. She estimates that she previously spent at least $20 per month on the bus, money that\u2019s now back in her pocket to pay for groceries and other monthly expenses. \u201cIt\u2019s a good service that the city provides, just like how the library is free,\u201d she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keener says the city has seen ridership shift since the pandemic launched a new era of remote work and Albuquerque launched free transit: fewer commuters, and more people experiencing homelessness who can now more easily use the bus to reach their destinations or who are using it as shelter from the elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recovering ridership</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ridership has steadily increased since Albuquerque first piloted zero fares in 2022, with overall ridership up 20% in the past three years. <a href=\"https://www.cabq.gov/transit/news/7-million-rides-strong-abq-ride-is-making-a-comeback\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">City officials</a> credit the zero-fare program with helping ABQ Ride\u2019s ridership numbers creep back up toward pre-pandemic levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Albuquerque, Kansas City, Missouri, made headlines when it became the first major U.S. city to go fare-free in 2020. But five years later, the Kansas City Council <a href=\"https://www.kcur.org/news/2025-04-04/kansas-city-will-reinstate-bus-fares-and-reduce-frequency-of-most-routes-under-funding-plan\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">voted to bring back $2 fares</a> in an attempt to stave off major service cuts amid a budget shortfall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for now, at least, it seems like Albuquerque\u2019s free fares are sticking around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fare revenue previously \u201cwasn\u2019t much of anything,\u201d according to Keener, and brought in about $3 million in revenue before the cost of collecting fare was deducted. That represented a drop in the bucket for the transit agency\u2019s $67 million annual budget, comprised of about $23 million from the city\u2019s transportation infrastructure tax and about $8 million from the county and other regional government entities. The rest of the budget is subsidized from the city\u2019s General Fund to the tune of about $30 million each year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The city\u2019s recently approved budget for fiscal year 2026 kept this subsidy, and the city \u201cstands behind its zero-fares system,\u201d Keener says, adding that the agency\u2019s focus right now is on expanding routes and increasing service frequency. ABQ Ride served 7 million riders in 2024, which is about 78% of the agency\u2019s pre-pandemic ridership numbers\u2014but ABQ Ride is also operating at only 64% of its pre-pandemic service, with reduced frequency on many routes and some headways of up to an hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ABQ Ride is in the process of implementing a revamped \u201c<a href=\"https://abqrideforward.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ABQ-RIDE-Forward-Virtual-Public-Meeting-Phase-III.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recovery network</a>\u201d that aims to bring the agency back to about 95% of pre-pandemic service, according to Keener, since returning to 100% of service levels wouldn\u2019t be financially feasible. The proposed recovery network includes <a href=\"https://abq-ride-forward-recovery-network.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">streamlining and restructuring some routes</a> to offset costs of increasing frequency and evening and weekend service. The reconfiguring is expected to increase the number of residents within a half-mile of a route with frequent service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ramirez views expanding frequency as the next step after making buses free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Ramirez, ABQ Ride has long tried to do \u201ca lot with a little,\u201d with the recovery plan raising questions of whether the agency should focus on having as many routes as possible or improving service in high-passenger areas. \u201cWe need more frequency in the places that need it most,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe bus should be for everybody,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt should be to connect people who need it most to get where they need to go. It\u2019s people getting to schools, it\u2019s people getting to work, it\u2019s people getting outdoors, it\u2019s people getting food, it\u2019s people getting to healthcare.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<p><em>This story was supported with grant funding from <a href=\"https://www.nealpeircefoundation.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Neal Peirce Foundation</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story was originally published by <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__nextcity.org_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=RXKGy0nj_EIT6X84yEymh4LIJnrXTWsTyicD9JoQJE4&amp;m=IfZmInIOoCZ_wD4Q2CgwC_SZRoWTimS6qjT0gqhJwiceJWIjaDuxcbkF1LSpR5Mu&amp;s=eOYAEhXxT723p8hz73i1Pk-ORRJl_5kn9tQJa5213hk&amp;e=\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Next City</a>, a nonprofit news outlet covering solutions for equitable cities.

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91372031/3-simple-steps-to-overcome-self-doubt-at-work",
    "description": "<p>I\u2019ve spent over two decades on stages around the world as a charity auctioneer. Even in the earliest years of my career, my job exposed me to titans of industry and people at the highest levels of business. But as I became more experienced in my career, I always had the same thought: W<em>hat am I doing here? Everyone here knows so much more than I do.\u00a0</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any comments or thoughts I planned to share remained exactly that\u2014thoughts\u2014because when I opened my mouth, I worried everyone would remember I wasn\u2019t supposed to be at the table in the first place. What started as a feeling that stopped me from speaking followed me in my career. That feeling stopped me from putting my hand up for a promotion, a raise, or for anything at all. It made me feel like I wasn\u2019t supposed to be sitting in the boardroom\u2014or anywhere near the building, for that matter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk to any woman who has been in the working world or in a leadership position in the past two decades, and she can tell you all about imposter syndrome. Imposter syndrome is a feeling that stops many of us, particularly women, in our tracks. It keeps many of us from getting into the room where we would have the chance to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you ascend the corporate ladder, no matter how deserving you are of a new title, a raise, or a new position, you may never truly believe you deserve any of it. When you look around a room of your peers, there\u2019s a little voice inside telling you that you\u2019re lucky to be in that room. Sound familiar?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s time to surmount the syndrome.\u00a0 Start with this simple three-step process so you can focus on the thing that matters most: you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-stop-the-spiral\">1. STOP THE SPIRAL</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell me if this sounds familiar: You\u2019re having a conversation with someone in your life\u2014a friend, someone senior in your office, or someone whose opinion you care deeply about. They mention they are so glad that they get to see you now that your children are getting older and you can be in the office more. The comment stops you cold. Now you\u2019re spiraling, your mind filling in a narrative. <em>I\u2019ve been out of the game for years. Everyone here thinks I don\u2019t work hard enough, that I\u2019m not here enough, that I don\u2019t do a good job. I need to show them I do care. I\u2019ll start working on the weekends, do extra work</em> . . . On and on you go with a spiral of self-doubt and insecurity about everything that you have ever felt about your job performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What did this person actually say? \u201cIt\u2019s great to see you in the office more now that your children are getting older.\u201d Period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your answer? \u201cThanks!\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>End scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-control-the-narrative-nbsp\">2. CONTROL THE NARRATIVE&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Believe in yourself enough to believe that other people are thinking the best of you, not the worst. To really slam that imposter syndrome, rewrite your own story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s go back and rewrite that scene, shall we?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What did that person say? \u201cIt\u2019s great to see you in the office more now that your children are getting older.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what I want you to hear: \u201cYou are such a valuable member of this team, it\u2019s really great to have your positive energy in this office. You must be an incredible multitasker to be raising kids at home and crushing it at work, too. What a role model for the people around you. We are lucky to have you.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>End scene. Cue applause.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-accept-there-are-no-gold-stars-in-life\">3. ACCEPT THERE ARE NO GOLD STARS IN LIFE</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Never forget there are no gold stars given out when you are an adult. No one gives you a gold star for showing up to work, just like no one gives you a gold star for making your bed when you get up in the morning. You are responsible for everything that happens in your life and your response to it. Once you stop looking for affirmation from those around you and seek it from yourself, you can realize you have had the power all along.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Bollin was previously convicted of murder.</p>\n        <p>According to prosecutors, on April 8, 2021, Bollin hid a firearm in his lunch cooler and went to work at Kent Moore Cabinets.

A trooper, Juan Tovar, tried to apprehend him at his house, and Bollin shot him in the left eye. Tovar, who lost the eye, retreated to his vehicle.</p>\n        <p>The district attorney\u2019s office noted that the mothers of Whited and Ordonez addressed the jury and described \"how their relatives have suffered physically since the shooting.\"</p>\n        <p>In a statement, prosecutors said, \"Brazos County was changed forever by this defendant\u2019s actions.

A judge subsequently sentenced Cuellar-Torres to life in prison with a minimum of 32.5 years.</p>\n        <p>The two victims, ages 17 and 16 at the time, attended a birthday party in Hillsboro on Oct. 21, 2023. Prosecutors said, \"The brother of the teen celebrating her birthday felt the victims were being disrespectful.\" The brother reportedly asked his friends, including Cuellar-Torres, who were part of a local gang, \"to help him confront\" the victims.</p>\n        <p>The brother allegedly drove Cuellar-Torres and three other teenagers, who were carrying firearms, back to the party. The brother and another teen reportedly \"lured the victims and others outside.\"</p>\n        <p>According to the district attorney\u2019s office, Cuellar-Torres and another teen \"hid in the shadows\" before opening fire on the victims, striking them. Seventeen-year-old Jesus Copado-Oropeza died as a result, and the other victim sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Authorities recovered 22 shell casings at the scene.</p>\n        <p>Cuellar-Torres and the teenager who was with him reportedly confessed to the crime. Prosecutors said they uncovered text messages between Cuellar-Torres and his fellow gang members in which the defendant \"complained that he was 'losing time' and wanted to 'catch a body' before he turned 18.\"</p>\n        <p>Cuellar-Torres\u2019 gang associate allegedly told him he would get charged as an adult, but the defendant \"dismissed those concerns, saying he would blame alcohol and drugs for his decisions and would avoid punishment.\"&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>According to the district attorney\u2019s office, Cuellar-Torres boasted about killing Copado-Oropeza in a separate chat and \"claimed that he could now become a cartel assassin.\"</p>\n        <p>The defendant was less than a month away from turning 18 at the time of the shooting. He was originally charged as a juvenile and then transferred to adult court for prosecution following a waiver proceeding. Prosecutors noted that \"the juvenile justice reforms will make the defendant eligible for parole consideration after 15 years and conditional release after serving half of his sentence.\"</p>\n        <p>The defendant will be booked into the Oregon Department of Corrections to serve his sentence at the Oregon Youth Authority.</p>\n        <p><strong>MORE:</strong></p>\n        <ul><li><a href=\"https://washingtoncountyda.org/da/news/2025/07/21/derek-owen-cuellar-torres-pleads-guilty-homicide-case\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Owen Cuellar-Torres Pleads Guilty in Homicide Case - Washington County District Attorney's Office</a></li></ul>",

Without providing evidence, Trump has called the men \u201csome of the most violent savages on the face of the Earth.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Last week, the men were released as suddenly as they\u2019d been taken away. Now, the truth of all their stories \u2014 one by one \u2014 will begin to be told. </p>\n\n<p>Starting here. </p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve compiled <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/venezuelan-immigrants-trump-deported-cecot/\">a first-of-its-kind, case-by-case accounting of 238 Venezuelan men who were held in El Salvador</a>.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>ProPublica, The Texas Tribune and a team of Venezuelan journalists from Alianza Rebelde Investiga (Rebel Alliance Investigates) and Cazadores de Fake News (Fake News Hunters) spent the past four months reporting on the men\u2019s lives and their backgrounds. We obtained government data that included whether they had been convicted of crimes in the U.S. or had pending charges. We found most were listed solely as having immigration violations. We also conducted interviews with relatives of more than 100 of the men; reviewed thousands of pages of court records from the U.S. and South America; and analyzed federal immigration court data.</p>\n\n<p>Some of our findings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>We obtained internal data showing that the Trump administration knew that at least 197 of the men had not been convicted of crimes in the U.S. \u2014 and that only six had been convicted of violent offenses. We identified fewer than a dozen additional convictions, both for crimes committed in the U.S. and abroad, that were not reflected in the government data.</p>\n\n</li>\n<li><p>Nearly half of the men, or 118, were whisked out of the country while in the middle of their immigration cases, which should have protected them from deportation. Some were only days away from a final hearing. </p>\n\n</li>\n<li><p>At least 166 of the men have tattoos. Interviews with families, immigration documents and court records show the government relied heavily on tattoos to tie the men to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua \u2014 even though law enforcement experts told us that tattoos are not an indicator of gang membership. </p>\n\n</li>\n<li><p>The men who were imprisoned range in age from 18 to 46. The impact of their monthslong incarceration extended beyond them. Their wives struggled to pay the rent. Relatives went without medical treatment. Their children wondered if they would see them again.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson did not respond to questions about the men in the database but said Trump \u201cis committed to keeping his promises to the American people and removing dangerous criminal and terrorist illegals who pose a threat to the American public.\u201d She referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security, which did not respond. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/venezuelan-immigrants-trump-deported-cecot/\">Read the men\u2019s stories in our database.</a></p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Reporting by: <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/perla-trevizo\">Perla Trevizo</a>, ProPublica and The Texas Tribune; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/melissa-sanchez\">Melisa S\u00e1nchez</a>, ProPublica; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/mica-rosenberg\">Mica Rosenberg</a>, ProPublica; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/gabriel-sandoval\">Gabriel Sandoval</a>, ProPublica; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/jeff-ernsthausen\">Jeff Ernsthausen</a>, ProPublica; Ronna Risquez, Alianza Rebelde; Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, Cazadores de Fake News; Adriana N\u00fa\u00f1ez Moros, independent journalist; Carlos Centeno, independent journalist; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/maryam-jameel\">Maryam Jameel</a>, ProPublica; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/gerardo-del-valle\">Gerardo del Valle</a>, ProPublica; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/cengiz-yar\">Cengiz Yar</a>, ProPublica; Gabriel Pasquini, independent journalist; Kate Morrisey, independent journalist; Coral Murphy Marcos, independent journalist; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/lomi-kriel\">Lomi Kriel</a>, ProPublica and The Texas Tribune; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/nicole-foy\">Nicole Foy</a>, ProPublica; Rafael Carranza, Arizona Luminaria; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/lisa-riordan-seville\">Lisa Seville</a>, ProPublica</p>\n<p>Design and development by: <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/ruth-talbot\">Ruth Talbot</a>, ProPublica</p>\n<p>Additional design and development by: <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/zisiga-mukulu\">Zisiga Mukulu</a>, ProPublica</p>\n<p>Additional data reporting by: <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/agnel-philip\">Agnel Philip</a>, ProPublica</p>",

    "title": "The Huawei Dilemma: Why Europe Needs Strong Intelligence Guardrails",
    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/huawei-spain-intelligence",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>Spain's recent decision to award Huawei a contract worth \u20ac12.3 million to manage and store legally authorized wiretaps raises significant concerns about the country's commitment to digital sovereignty. This move jeopardizes Spain\u2019s national security and undermines the trust that is essential for the intelligence-sharing frameworks of the European Union and NATO.</p><p>While Huawei has made considerable efforts to demonstrate technical compliance with European standards, the political reality is more complicated: any sensitive system it builds is, by default, subject to exploitation by Beijing. Huawei is subject to China\u2019s 2017 National Intelligence Law and cannot credibly claim complete independence from the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP\u2019s) security and intelligence apparatus. Despite this, Madrid\u2019s procurement process proceeded as if the controversy around Huawei had no bearing on the domain of sensitive state surveillance networks.</p><p>This episode highlights the lack of clear institutional safeguards in Europe and among transatlantic allies for assessing foreign vendors in critical intelligence systems. While the EU\u2019s 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox has guided member states regarding telecommunications infrastructure, there is no similar framework for the technologies that support law enforcement and intelligence operations. The result is fragmentation: some countries exclude Huawei on national security grounds, while others invite it to manage their surveillance backbones.</p><p>This divergence is not sustainable in an environment that requires intelligence sharing to stay ahead of adversaries.</p><p><strong>Spain\u2019s SITEL Contract is Effectively A Security Breach</strong></p><p>Spain\u2019s wiretap system, SITEL, functions as the core for Spanish law enforcement and intelligence wiretap activities, storing sensitive data about targets involved in terrorism, organized crime, and even foreign espionage.</p><p>Huawei is technically capable of managing such a system, but under China\u2019s 2017 National Intelligence Law, the company is compelled to cooperate with Chinese intelligence services. This creates a constant vulnerability in any critical infrastructure that Huawei or any PRC company operates abroad. However, Spain's procurement process treated Huawei's bid as if it were a neutral supplier.</p><p>Political factors have also shaped Madrid's decision. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez's government has aimed to strengthen economic ties with China, seeking investment and technological collaboration. This approach has caused Spain to clash with several EU states that have taken a more cautious stance toward Huawei in telecom infrastructure. There is also unease within Spain; reports indicate that officials from the national police and Guardia Civil have expressed concerns about depending on a Chinese vendor for such a sensitive role.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Sign up for the </strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>Cyber Initiatives Group</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

The country\u2019s cybersecurity agency later banned Huawei from 5G networks used in critical sectors after detecting unusual data traffic patterns at a Brussels telecom hub.</p><p>The \u201cGeneration\u201d bribery scandal worsened these concerns. Members of the European Parliament accepted lavish perks from lobbyists linked to Huawei, raising fears that influence operations had penetrated EU regulatory bodies. This incident eroded public trust and showed how corruption scandals can weaken vendor neutrality.</p><p>Belgium\u2019s swift and decisive response demonstrates a security-first approach, which should be adopted across the EU and transatlantic alliance. In contrast, Spain\u2019s SITEL contract indicates either a gap in awareness or a willingness to take risks that could affect Europe\u2019s shared security framework.</p><p><strong>Diverging National Paths Across Alliances</strong></p><p>The approach to Huawei varies further across Europe. Greece demonstrates how economic dependence can override security concerns \u2014 the country chose Huawei as a key provider for its telecommunications infrastructure. Huawei has even offered discounted equipment and \u201ctraining centers\u201d for Greek engineers to strengthen this relationship further. However, leaked documents in 2024 revealed that Huawei provided perks to Greek officials to secure these contracts.</p><p>Elsewhere in Europe, Huawei maintains a significant market share in Germany\u2019s 5G infrastructure despite pressure from the U.S. and the EU to choose a different path. Berlin adopted a pragmatic integration strategy and argued that excluding Huawei would incur prohibitive costs and delay 5G deployment. Germany has imposed limited restrictions on Huawei in specific networks, but the company nonetheless remains central to its telecom infrastructure.</p><p>These divergent national approaches illustrate Europe\u2019s fractured response. Greece and Germany focused on cost and speed, while Belgium emphasized national security, leaving the EU without a unified strategy.</p><p><strong>Conflict-Zone Dynamics</strong></p><p>Recent patterns emerging from conflict zones further emphasize the urgent need for a unified security policy. In Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, local populations and military operations are increasingly served by unauthorized mobile operators using Russian and potentially Chinese-supplied infrastructure. These networks\u2014established in Crimea, Donbas, and southern Ukraine\u2014are not only illegal under international law but also structurally opaque, enabling surveillance, population control, and disinformation on a large scale. Evidence indicates that Chinese vendors have been involved in providing equipment to these unauthorized operators, either directly or through intermediaries. In Crimea, for example, existing infrastructure was reportedly transformed using Russian intercept technology (SORM), raising concerns that Chinese equipment may have aided these transitions.</p><p>This reality exposes a significant blind spot in current EU and NATO frameworks. If hostile actors can take over infrastructure built with Chinese components during war, it is naive to think the same systems would stay secure during peacetime or under foreign pressure. The lesson is clear: infrastructure is deeply tied to geopolitical goals. Allowing vendors linked to authoritarian regimes to operate within the backbone of democratic intelligence or law enforcement systems not only compromises sovereignty but also offers adversarial regimes chances to exploit legal ambiguities and technical backdoors in moments of crisis.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

However, the alliance\u2019s guidance remains focused on telecommunications rather than surveillance and intelligence systems. This gap in oversight is significant. Intelligence-sharing within NATO depends on the secure handling of sensitive data. If one member state allows a high-risk vendor to operate its interception system, it creates a weakest-link problem that undermines trust. With adversaries mainly relying on hybrid threats, which exploit economic and technological channels to weaken the alliance, Huawei\u2019s presence in SITEL is a glaring vulnerability.</p><p><strong>Why Binding Guardrails Matter</strong></p><p>Intelligence sharing fundamentally depends on mutual assurances. The EU and NATO operate on the assumption that member states follow similar security standards. When one state diverges, it jeopardizes the effectiveness of the entire group. This creates a real risk, as adversaries can exploit these gaps to breach shared systems and compromise allied operations.</p><p>The debate over Huawei is not just about technology; it is about the integrity of Europe\u2019s intelligence infrastructure. Without enforceable standards, Europe\u2019s goals for strategic autonomy will be undermined by compromises and strategic divisions.</p><p>Policy Prescriptions: Binding EU & NATO Mechanisms</p><ol><li><strong>Codify Vendor Exclusion Policies:</strong> The European Commission should formalize its 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox from a voluntary framework into a binding directive, at least concerning intelligence infrastructure. This regulation must require the exclusion of vendors subject to foreign intelligence laws from operating within critical national security systems.</li><li><strong>Align NATO procurement standards:</strong> NATO must implement a collective security standard that requires member States to vet vendors for potential State influence and espionage risks.</li><li><strong>Support Member-State Transitions:</strong> For countries already relying on high-risk vendors, the EU and NATO should provide transition assistance to subsidize migration to trusted suppliers. This approach balances security needs with economic realities.</li><li><strong>Enhance Transparency in Intelligence Procurement:</strong> Member States should share sanitized risk assessments for major intelligence infrastructure contracts with other member State services whose security relies on them. Transparency enables allied oversight and strengthens democratic accountability.</li></ol><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Spain\u2019s Huawei contract highlights a deeper problem: the lack of binding standards to safeguard Europe\u2019s intelligence infrastructure. Procurement policy is a matter of national security. As hybrid threats grow and alliances face unprecedented pressure, EU and NATO leaders must act to address this critical gap. Without enforceable guidelines, the trust that underpins Europe\u2019s security framework is in jeopardy.</p><p>Europe\u2019s credibility hinges on its ability to align its intelligence infrastructure with alliance standards; otherwise, it risks increasing strategic division.</p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

Webster</a>, <a href=\"https://veritenews.org/\">Verite News</a>                </p>\n                                             \n\n        \n                        <p>This article was produced for ProPublica\u2019s Local Reporting Network in partnership with <a href=\"https://veritenews.org/\">Verite News</a>. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/dispatches\">Sign up for Dispatches</a> to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.</p>\n\n        \n\n    \n      \n  \n\n\n\n                    \n<p>Louisiana passed a new police accountability law following allegations of civil rights violations against a sheriff\u2019s deputy <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/three-children-attacked-a-black-woman-a-sheriffs-deputy-arrived-and-beat-her-more\">caught on video dragging a Black woman</a> by her hair and slamming her head into the ground.</p>\n\n<p>The woman, Shantel Arnold, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26018127-shantel-arnold-lawsuit/#document/p1\">sued the deputy and the sheriff</a>, accusing the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office of conspiring to cover up the 2021 assault. The Sheriff\u2019s Office agreed in March to pay Arnold $300,000 after three days of trial but before jury deliberations began, Arnold\u2019s attorney said.</p>\n\n<p>After the incident, ProPublica, in partnership with WRKF, WWNO and The Times-Picayune, published an investigation detailing the long <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/louisiana-deputy-who-slammed-a-black-woman-on-the-pavement-was-named-in-multiple-suits-records-show\">history of excessive-force complaints</a> against Jefferson Parish sheriff\u2019s Deputy Julio Alvarado. Alvarado, a 20-year veteran of the Sheriff\u2019s Office, was employed by the department as of March.</p>\n\n<p>Arnold\u2019s attorney, state Sen. Gary Carter, D-New Orleans, said he introduced the legislation after it emerged that Alvarado had <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/jefferson-parish-sheriff-deputy-alvarado-lopinto\">failed to write a report</a> about his encounter with Arnold despite his department\u2019s policy that officers document each time they use force. Jefferson Parish Sheriff Joseph Lopinto said during his testimony in the March trial over Arnold\u2019s lawsuit that Alvarado\u2019s commanders instructed him against writing such a report after video of his actions spread across social media.</p>\n\n<p>Arnold\u2019s run-in with Alvarado, which was captured in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_5arYnINQ&amp;t=22s\">14-second video</a>, left the woman with bruises and scratches across her body, a busted lip and recurring headaches, according to her subsequent account to police investigators.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHad it not been for a bystander capturing how this officer beat up Shantel Arnold, there would be no report, there would be no evidence of it, there would be no indication that it ever happened,\u201d Carter said in a recent interview.</p>\n\n<p>The new law, passed unanimously by state legislators and signed by Gov. Jeff Landry in June, will <a href=\"https://legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1426023\">require all law enforcement agencies</a> to report every time an officer\u2019s use of force results in serious injury. It directs the Council on Peace Officer Standards and Training, which certifies police officers, to adopt a policy on mandatory use-of-force reporting by Jan. 1. Details of how the process will work have not been spelled out, nor has the penalty for failing to comply.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The bill was introduced as \u201c<a href=\"https://legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1414416\">Shantel Arnold\u2019s Law</a>,\u201d but Carter said that name was removed because \u201cSheriff Lopinto got very upset about that, and that almost killed the bill.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Neither the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office nor Alvarado\u2019s attorney responded to requests for comment or an interview.</p>\n\n<p>Alvarado came across Arnold in September 2021, when the officer responded to a 911 call about a fight among 25 people in Jefferson Parish. When the deputy pulled up in his patrol car, Alvarado saw Arnold, covered in dirt, walking down the street. Arnold told the deputy she was attacked by a group of boys who frequently bullied her. When Alvarado ordered her to stop, Arnold said she just wanted to go home and kept walking. That\u2019s when the deputy jumped out of his vehicle, grabbed Arnold and slammed her into the sidewalk, according to several witnesses.</p>\n\n<p>In a video taken by a bystander, Alvarado drags Arnold along the pavement, holds her by her braids and slams her repeatedly onto the pavement. Arnold was not charged with a crime and was later taken to a hospital. The Sheriff\u2019s Office did not use body cameras at the time but has since begun using them.</p>\n\n<p>The Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office denied wrongdoing. A <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/jefferson-parish-sheriff-deputy-alvarado-lopinto\">2022 internal investigation</a> by the Sheriff\u2019s Office determined Alvarado\u2019s actions against Arnold were \u201cboth reasonable and acceptable.\u201d Alvarado received an \u201capproximately\u201d 40-hour suspension for failing to file a written report, Lopinto said in his March testimony.</p>\n\n<p>Arnold alleged in her 2022 lawsuit that the Sheriff\u2019s Office knew Alvarado had a propensity for violence against Black people and other minority groups yet continued to have him patrol such communities, putting the public in danger.</p>\n\n<p>Lopinto attributed Alvarado\u2019s history of complaints to his working a high-crime beat, according to a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/jefferson-parish-sheriff-deputy-alvarado-lopinto\">2022 Times-Picayune interview</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s getting a complaint every month,\u201d Lopinto said. During that same interview, Lopinto dismissed Arnold\u2019s account and accused her of \u201clooking for a paycheck.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Alvarado\u2019s alleged misdeeds fit a broader pattern in the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office, as the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/series/unwatched\">yearlong investigation into the Sheriff\u2019s Office</a> by ProPublica, WRKF and WWNO found. Between 2013 and 2021, deputies disproportionately discharged guns against Black people. Of the 40 people shot at by Jefferson Parish deputies during that time, 73% were Black, more than double their share of the population. Twelve of the 16 people who died after being shot or restrained by deputies during that time were Black.</p>\n\n<p>Alvarado has been named in at least 10 federal civil rights lawsuits since 2007, all involving the use of excessive force; eight of the plaintiffs were members of minority groups. </p>\n\n<p>The Sheriff\u2019s Office settled three of those lawsuits. Arnold\u2019s $300,000 payout is the third \u2014 and largest \u2014 settlement involving Alvarado. Five other lawsuits were closed in favor of the Sheriff\u2019s Office, one was dismissed on a legal technicality and one was indefinitely delayed.</p>\n\n<p>The Sheriff\u2019s Office said in filings responding to the eight lawsuits that were not dismissed or delayed that officers\u2019 actions were \u201creasonable under the circumstances\u201d and characterized the claims as \u201cfrivolous.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Prior to the 2021 incident involving Arnold, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office had settled a 2016 lawsuit accusing Alvarado of grabbing a 14-year-old Hispanic boy by the neck and slamming his head against the concrete as the child screamed, \u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d A woman had called the police complaining that the boy and a friend were wrestling in a parking lot. Alvarado then threatened to have the boy and his family deported, according to the suit. The Sheriff\u2019s Office, which paid the boy\u2019s family $15,000, said in court filings that Alvarado\u2019s actions were \u201creasonable under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In 2018, another lawsuit claimed Alvarado and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/if-everybodys-white-there-cant-be-any-racial-bias-the-disappearance-of-hispanic-drivers-from-traffic-records\">three deputies beat Atdner Casco</a>, a Honduran native, and stole more than $2,000 from him during a traffic stop the year before, then conspired to have him deported. Casco claimed Alvarado beat and choked him until he agreed to keep silent about being robbed. The Sheriff\u2019s Office denied wrongdoing but settled that case in 2020 for $50,000.</p>\n\n<p>Both incidents were cited in Arnold\u2019s lawsuit as evidence that Alvarado has exhibited a pattern of behavior throughout his career that made him unfit for duty. Carter, Arnold\u2019s attorney, raised yet another incident during the March trial in which sheriff detectives in December 2019 witnessed Alvarado patronizing a massage parlor that was being investigated for suspected prostitution. Alvarado denied he went there to \u201chave a sexual act performed on him.\u201d He was demoted from sergeant to deputy for \u201cbringing the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office in disrepute\u201d and for patronizing an \u201cillegitimate business while on duty and neglecting your responsibilities to detectives under your command,\u201d Carter said during the trial, citing an internal police report.</p>\n\n<p>Carter said in an interview that Lopinto\u2019s continued defense and employment of Alvarado represented a permissive attitude toward questionable behavior.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe stood by\u201d Alvarado, who \u201cshows no contrition, no remorse,\u201d Carter said.</p>",

Rumors also circulated that his running mate, Hsiao Bi-khim, had misrepresented the status of her U.S. citizenship, falsely <a href=\"https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.34749EQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">claiming</a> to have renounced it to meet the eligibility requirements for office.</p><p>Earlier this summer, videos were posted to social media platforms purporting to show President Lai promoting questionable cryptocurrency investments. Other anti-unification figures are shown in blurry-mouthed clips boasting about the government\u2019s role in developing digital currency software. Other clips that went viral insist that the government in Taipei is undergoing a secret operation to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67891869\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">harvest</a> the blood of its citizens so that the United States can create a bioweapon to attack China.</p><p>Every day, social media feeds in Taiwan are flooded with a mix of sensational and carefully-crafted, more subdued claims. They range from fear-mongering about a potential cross-strait conflict to narratives portraying the Republic of China as grappling with <a href=\"https://english.cw.com.tw/article/article.action?id=3580\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">racism</a> and <a href=\"https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/articles/9972\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">food safety</a> issues, to casting doubt on its relationship with Washington.</p><p>In 2023, Taiwan\u2019s National Security Bureau reported a 60 percent increase in Chinese-origin disinformation over the previous year, with a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-disinformation-3f05dac36399bf672a702100147bf8fa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">documented</a> 2.16 million cases on record. Now, as tensions between Beijing and Taipei continue, so too does the sophistication\u2014and volume\u2014of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s disinformation campaign.</p><p>\u201cChina conducts overwhelming political warfare against Taiwan\u2014disinformation, cognitive warfare, fake news,\u201d Liang-Chih Evans Chen, Associate Research Fellow, Institute for National Defense and Security Research, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant battle for public perception and morale. And it\u2019s getting worse.\u201d</p><p>According to Taiwan\u2019s National Security Bureau, China is increasingly leveraging generative artificial intelligence to amplify disinformation efforts aimed at destabilizing Taiwan.</p><p>\u201cThe quality used to be questionable, but that has changed. With AI and deepfake technology, the People\u2019s Liberation Army can manipulate videos and other very convincing media,\u201d one high-ranking Taiwanese military official working in psychological operations, who spoke anonymously because they are not authorized to speak on the record, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cSometimes, they also take raw local footage and re-edit it to appear as if it\u2019s coming from within Taiwan, making it more believable and easier to influence people.\u201d</p><p>So far in 2025, more than 500,000 \u201ccontroversial messages\u201d <a href=\"https://www.arise.tv/china-using-ai-to-fuel-disinformation-campaigns-against-taiwan-says-security-bureau/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">linked</a> back to China have circulated on platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and X, often spiking during politically sensitive moments such as President Lai Ching-te\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/north-east-asia/taiwan-strait-china/president-lais-first-year-sees-increased-tensions-across-taiwan-strait\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">statements</a> on cross-strait relations or major announcements like new U.S. investments by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).</p><p>Disinformation is also <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-disinformation-3f05dac36399bf672a702100147bf8fa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">spread</a> through YouTube, encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, and via fake accounts that used AI-generated profile photos, deepfakes, and phony news articles to make propaganda appear organic and credible.</p><p>\u201cStarting around 2008, China\u2019s main strategy was to purchase media companies in Taiwan to spread their narratives easily. This was somewhat successful. But in 2014, after the Sunflower Movement, a large student-led social movement, China realized young people weren\u2019t watching traditional TV; they got news online,\u201d DPP Legislator and Associate Professor at National Taipei University Graduate School of Criminology, Puma Shen, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThey created many websites that acted like news outlets but were actually filled with disinformation and fake news. Some were based in Singapore or Malaysia but operated by Chinese actors.\u201d</p><p>Shen explained that Facebook was long the \u201cmain channel for distribution.\u201d His team reported suspicious sites to the tech giant, which subsequently blocked them, but \u201cthis method only worked until around 2019-2020,\u201d according to Shen.</p><p>\u201cAfter that, they shifted focus to YouTube. They used AI voices to convert articles into videos with images and then shared those videos on Facebook. Facebook couldn\u2019t block YouTube URLs, so this became a new battlefield,\u201d Shen told us. \u201cCurrently, 70 to 80 percent of political news in Chinese on YouTube is influenced by China\u2019s disinformation campaigns. Google tries to act but struggles. Before Taiwan\u2019s 2024 presidential election, Google removed about 200 Chinese government-related channels per day, but it\u2019s hard to keep up.\u201d</p><p>The biggest struggle now is TikTok, as Taipei has \u201cno cooperation there,\u201d according to Shen.</p><p>\u201cThe algorithm controls what information people see. It\u2019s designed for quick, passive consumption, making it a great tool for brainwashing. Even if only one video out of fifty contains a political message, that message gets embedded in your mind,\u201d Shen said. \u201cThe algorithm isn\u2019t transparent, so they can decide what to show and influence people\u2019s thoughts. This is dangerous, especially when people spend hours swiping through videos daily.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>From disinformation to deepfakes, Cipher Brief experts are tackling today\u2019s most-pressing national security issues at The Cipher Brief Threat Conference October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. If your business is national security, </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><p>Observers also point out that Beijing has shifted its tactics in recent years, moving away from overt messaging on cross-strait relations to more passively stoking internal divisions within Taiwan. This includes smear campaigns and false claims about local services. Often, the disinformation is masked as clickbait\u2014celebrity gossip or wellness content\u2014that subtly steers readers toward politically motivated conspiracy theories.</p><p>The mainland\u2019s disinformation efforts <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-dossiers/asia-pacific-regional-security-assessment-2024/chapter-5/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">involve</a> a broad network of state actors, including its military\u2019s Strategic Support Force, the Ministry of State Security, the Central Propaganda Department, and the Ministry of Public Security\u2014all playing distinct roles in cyber operations, propaganda, and information control. These agencies push overt messaging through state media and diplomatic channels and run covert campaigns, often in partnership with private companies or loosely affiliated groups like hacktivists.</p><p>Outsourcing these operations to commercial entities is a growing trend, making attribution more difficult. This includes paid propagandists, troll farms, clickbait content creators, and data firms selling disinformation tools. By hiring third parties to execute these campaigns, the Chinese government obscures its involvement, complicating accountability and amplifying the reach and sophistication of its influence operations.</p><p>Tactics also include collaborating with sympathetic Taiwanese media, amplifying critical voices from within Taiwan\u2014such as retired military officials and political influencers\u2014and targeting younger audiences through popular platforms.</p><p>Experts underscore that disinformation is becoming more subtle, often disguised as health advice or entertainment before veering into political messaging. While Beijing denies interfering in Taiwan\u2019s affairs, the growing sophistication of these campaigns, bolstered by evolving AI tools, poses an increasingly complex threat to Taiwan\u2019s information integrity and security.</p><p>China\u2019s disinformation campaign aims, analysts say, to erode public trust in Taiwan\u2019s government, particularly the ruling DPP while deterring support for Taiwanese independence.</p><p>Ching Yang, one of the leading investigators at the Taipei-based disinformation monitoring organization Doublethink Lab, highlighted that newspapers in Hong Kong \u201chave recently accused certain politicians or their families of accepting U.S. money to create divisions between Taiwan and Mainland China.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey use allegations about projects and funding to drive disinformation aimed at weakening Taiwan\u2019s unity,\u201d he tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. The DPP, however, may not be the CCP\u2019s primary target.</p><p>\u201cThe real enemy for China is not Taiwan,\u201d Shen stressed. \u201cIt is the U.S.\u201d He points out that there are around 13 \u201cmain narratives\u201d the CCP uses in its disinformation push.</p><p>\u201cWe tested which resonated most with Taiwanese teenagers \u2014 anti-U.S. messages ranked highest,\u201d Shen explained. \u201cThey push anti-U.S. messages both inside Taiwan and in the U.S. They (CCP) try to undermine trust in the U.S. and the West generally. Also, they discourage cooperation with Japan and India. For Taiwanese who are anti-China but consume enough anti-U.S. messaging, the strategy is to make them see China as not so bad.\u201d</p><p>In Taiwan, the disinformation approach is mainly to suggest that Washington is unreliable, would abandon Taiwan in a conflict, or is exploiting the island\u2014such as claims that U.S. arms sales are a scam or that U.S. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67891869\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pork</a> is not safe to consume, claims that have triggered large protests in the past.</p><p>These messages, often amplified by Beijing-linked actors or Taiwanese figures sympathetic to China, don\u2019t always rely on conspiracy theories; instead, they illuminate real news in ways that cast the U.S. in a negative light, fueling skepticism and weakening trust in the U.S.-Taiwan alliance. From Shen\u2019s purview, the objective is to \u201csow distrust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trust the government, don\u2019t trust the ruling party, don\u2019t trust democracy or the U.S,\u201d Shen noted. \u201cThey (CCP) want to persuade maybe 40-50 percent of Taiwanese that China isn\u2019t so bad, and that if China invades, it could take over quickly \u2014 so better to sign a peace agreement. The CCP wants to persuade its citizens that it\u2019s the best party because it brings stability and prosperity.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

Inside the mainland, disinformation helps legitimize potential military action by manufacturing public support and framing aggression as a justified response to Taiwanese provocation, reinforcing nationalist sentiment. Internationally, these campaigns offer China a legal and moral veneer, particularly for non-Western audiences, while casting Taiwan and its allies\u2014especially the U.S.\u2014as aggressors.</p><p>Taipei faces significant challenges in addressing threats posed by disinformation. The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau <a href=\"https://english.ftvnews.com.tw/news/2024119W09EA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">established</a> the Cognitive Warfare Research Center last year, to counter disinformation campaigns targeting Taiwan\u2019s democracy and security. In January, the government <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-disinformation-3f05dac36399bf672a702100147bf8fa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pledged</a> to double down on its efforts to counter burgeoning disinformation campaigns. In late 2022, the government <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202403220009\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">designated</a> Chinese media platforms\u2014including TikTok\u2014 a \u201cnational security threat\u201d and banned their use on government-issued devices. </p><p>While Beijing\u2019s efforts to influence public opinion have largely fallen flat, fatigue is setting in among Taiwanese citizens who are exposed to constant warnings and pressure. Experts warn that as Taiwan sharpens its defenses, China will only evolve its tactics, making future disinformation campaigns harder to detect and resist.</p><p>\u201cTaiwanese people generally recognize the danger from China. But politicians here, like in many countries, sometimes try to downplay it or persuade citizens otherwise,\u201d Shen said. \u201cSince we speak Chinese, we\u2019re vulnerable to Chinese disinformation and \u201clawfare,\u201d China\u2019s legal and political warfare to keep Taiwan isolated internationally.\u201d</p><p>Yang is concerned that Beijing\u2019s growing use of disinformation as a soft power tool could signal a prelude to more aggressive, hard-power or kinetic action.</p><p>\u201cCompared to Russia\u2019s tactics before invading Ukraine, China uses disinformation to frame their opponents negatively. For example, Russian propaganda accused Ukraine of being run by Nazis,\u201d he added. \u201cSimilarly, in Taiwan, Chinese media accuse the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and President Tsai Ing-wen of being \u2018Nazis\u2019 or extremists. This disinformation aims to justify aggression and create division internally.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.

Members of the movement, she said, understood that law enforcement agencies were surveilling their activities.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been warned my entire life, \u2018The FBI\u2019s watching us,\u2019\u201d said Farrell-Smith, a member of the Klamath Tribes in Oregon.</p>\n\n<p>Government records later confirmed <a href=\"https://shec.ashp.cuny.edu/exhibits/show/settler-colonialism-and-indige/item/3462\">wide-ranging FBI surveillance of the movement</a> in the 1970s, and now the agency is focused on her and a new generation of Indigenous activists challenging development of a mine in northern Nevada. Farrell-Smith advises the group People of Red Mountain, which opposes a Canadian company\u2019s efforts to tap what it says is one of the world\u2019s largest lithium deposits.</p>\n\n<p>Law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, have for years worked alongside private mine security to surveil the largely peaceful protesters who oppose the mine, called Thacker Pass, according to more than 2,000 pages of internal law enforcement communications reviewed by ProPublica. Officers and agents have tracked protesters\u2019 social media, while the mining company has gathered video from a camera above a campsite protesters set up on public land near the mine. An FBI joint terrorism task force in Reno met in June 2022 \u201cwith a focus on Thacker Pass,\u201d the records also show, and Lithium Americas \u2014 the main company behind the mine \u2014 hired a former FBI agent specializing in counterterrorism to develop its security plan.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re out there doing ceremony and they\u2019re surveilling us,\u201d Farrell-Smith said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey treat us like we\u2019re domestic terrorists,\u201d added Chanda Callao, an organizer with People of Red Mountain.</p>\n\n<p>All told, about 10 agencies have monitored the mine\u2019s opponents. In addition to the FBI, those agencies include the Bureau of Land Management, Humboldt County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Nevada State Police Highway Patrol, Winnemucca Police Department and Nevada Threat Analysis Center, the records show.</p>\n\n<p>Andrew Ferguson, who studies surveillance technology at the American University Washington College of Law, called the scrutiny of Indigenous and environmental protesters as potential terrorists \u201cchilling.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt obviously should be concerning to activists that anything they do in their local area might be seen in this broad-brush way of being a federal issue of terrorism or come under the observation of the FBI and all of the powers that come with it,\u201d Ferguson said.</p>\n\n<p>The FBI did not respond to requests for comment. The Bureau of Land Management, which coordinated much of the interagency response, declined to comment. Most of the law enforcement activity has focused on monitoring, and <a href=\"https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/free-speech-or-interference-in-rare-move-lithium-americas-sues-thacker-pass-protesters\">one person has been arrested to date</a> as a result of the protests.</p>\n\n<p>Mike Allen, who served as Humboldt County\u2019s sheriff until January 2023, said his office\u2019s role was simply to monitor the situation at Thacker Pass. \u201cWe would go up there and make periodic patrol activity,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Allen defended the joint terrorism task force, saying it was \u201cwhere we would just all get together and discuss things.\u201d (The FBI characterizes <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/terrorism/joint-terrorism-task-forces\">such task forces</a>, which include various agencies working in an area, as the front line of defense against terrorism.)</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            In this May 2022 email, an FBI special agent invites Nevada\u2019s Humboldt County Sheriff\u2019s Office to a joint terrorism task force meeting focused on Thacker Pass.\n    \n            (Records obtained by Siskiyou Rising Tide and Information for Public Use.

In all those cases, Lithium Americas avoided engagement with the protestors and coordinated with the local authorities when necessary for the protection of everyone involved.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Crowley noted that Lithium Americas has worked with Indigenous communities near the mine to study cultural artifacts and is offering to build projects worth millions of dollars for the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe, such as a community center and greenhouse.</p>\n\n<p>But individuals and the community groups opposed to the mine don\u2019t want money. They worry mining will pollute local sources of water in the nation\u2019s driest state and harm culturally significant sites, including that of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-lithium-corp-nevada-reno-native-americans-0057adec1750407e862e547a362d3aa8\">an 1865 massacre of Indigenous people.</a></p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe understand how the land is sacred and how much culture and how much history is within the McDermitt Caldera,\u201d Callao said of the basin where Thacker Pass is located. \u201cWe know how much it means to not only the next generation, but the next seven generations.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n\n                            \n                                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n\n            First image: Construction at Lithium Americas\u2019 Thacker Pass mine near Orovada, Nevada.

Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are contributing to increasingly intense hurricanes, heat waves, wildfires and droughts. The solution \u2014 powering the electrical grid, vehicles and factories with cleaner energy sources \u2014 brings tradeoffs.</p>\n\n<p>Massive amounts of metals are required to manufacture solar panels, wind turbines and other renewable energy infrastructure. Demand for lithium will skyrocket 350% by 2040, largely to be used in electric vehicles\u2019 rechargeable batteries, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/lithium-2\">according to the International Energy Agency</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. produces very little lithium \u2014 and China controls a majority of refining capacity worldwide \u2014 so development of Thacker Pass enjoys bipartisan support, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-technology-us-news-nevada-a045e1cb9e5be5d010186720143e4d54\">receiving a key permit</a> in President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-energy-dept-finalizes-226-billion-loan-lithium-americas-nevada-mine-2024-10-28/\">a $2.26 billion loan</a> from President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. (Development ran into issues in June, when a Nevada agency <a href=\"https://gbrw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lithium-Nevada-CD.pdf\">notified the company</a> that it was using groundwater without the proper permit. <a href=\"https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/06/26/state-orders-lithium-mine-to-stop-unauthorized-water-pumping-citing-rancher-dispute/\">Company representatives have said</a> they are confident that they will resolve the matter.)</p>\n\n<p>Many minerals needed to produce cleaner energy are found on Indigenous lands. For example, 85% of known global lithium reserves are on or near Indigenous people\u2019s lands, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-00994-6#Fig1\">according to a 2022 study</a> by researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia, the University of the Free State in South Africa and elsewhere. The situation has put Indigenous communities at odds with mining industries as tribes are asked to sacrifice land and sovereignty to combat climate change.</p>\n\n<p>Luke Danielson is a mining consultant and lawyer who for decades has researched how mining affects Indigenous lands. \u201cWhat I fear would be we set loose a land rush where we\u2019re trampling over all the Indigenous people and we\u2019re taking all the public land and essentially privatizing it to mining companies,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>If companies or governments attempt to force mining on such communities, it can slow development, noted Ciaran O\u2019Faircheallaigh, a professor emeritus of Australia\u2019s Griffith University and author of \u201cIndigenous Peoples and Mining.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf there are bulldozers coming down the road and they are going to destroy an area that is central to people\u2019s identity and their existence, they are going to fight,\u201d he said. \u201cThe solution is you actually put First Peoples in a position of equal power so that they can negotiate outcomes that allow for timely, and indeed speedy, development.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Environmental activists Will Falk, left, and Max Wilbert led early opposition to the mine, after which the Bureau of Land Management fined them tens of thousands of dollars for the cost of monitoring them.\n    \n            (David Calvert/The Nevada Independent)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n\u201cWe\u2019re Not There for an Uprising\u201d\n<p>Most of the documents tracing law enforcement\u2019s involvement at Thacker Pass were obtained via public records requests by two advocacy groups focused on climate change and law enforcement, Siskiyou Rising Tide and Information for Public Use. They shared the records with ProPublica, which obtained additional documents through separate public records requests to law enforcement agencies.</p>\n\n<p>Given the monitoring of mining\u2019s opponents highlighted in the records, experts raised questions about authorities\u2019 role: Is the government there to support industrial development, protect civil liberties or act as an unbiased arbiter? At Thacker Pass, the documents show, law enforcement has helped defend the mine.</p>\n\n<p>Protests have at times escalated.</p>\n\n<p>A small group of <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-an-anti-trans-group-split-the-fight-against-a-lithium-mine/\">more radical environmentalists led by non-Indigenous activists</a> propelled the early movement, setting up a campsite on public land near the proposed mine site in January 2021. In June 2022, a protester from France wrote on social media, \u201cWe\u2019ll need all the AR15s We can get on the frontlines!\u201d Tensions peaked in June 2023, when several protesters entered the worksite and blocked bulldozers, leading to one arrest.</p>\n\n<p>That group \u2014 which calls itself Protect Thacker Pass \u2014 argued that its actions were justified. Will Falk, one of the group\u2019s organizers, said that, in any confrontation, scrutiny unfairly falls on protesters instead of companies or the government. \u201cAs a culture, we\u2019ve become so used to militarized police that we don\u2019t understand that, out of the group of people gathered, the people who are actually violent are the ones with the guns,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Falk and another organizer were, as a result of their participation in protests, barred by court order from returning to Thacker Pass and disrupting construction, and the Bureau of Land Management fined them <a href=\"https://thisisreno.com/2021/09/blm-fines-attorney-involved-in-thacker-pass-lithium-mine-lawsuit/\">for alleged trespass on public lands during the protest</a>. The agency charged them $49,877.71 for officers\u2019 time and mileage to monitor them, according to agency records Falk shared with ProPublica. Falk said his group tried to work with the agency to obtain permits and is disputing the fine to a federal board of appeals.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNone of us are armed. We\u2019re not there for an uprising,\u201d said Gary McKinney, a spokesperson for People of Red Mountain, which parted ways with Falk\u2019s group before the incident that led to an arrest.</p>\n\n<p>McKinney, a member of the Duck Valley Shoshone-Paiute Tribe, leads annual prayer rides, journeying hundreds of miles across northern Nevada on horseback with other Native American activists to Thacker Pass. He described the rides, intended to raise awareness of mining\u2019s impact on tribes and the environment, as a way to exercise rights under the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, which protects tribes\u2019 ability to practice traditional spirituality. Still, the group feels watched. A trail camera once mysteriously appeared near their campsite along the path of the prayer ride. They also crossed paths with security personnel. </p>\n\n<p>Beyond the trail rides, the FBI tracks McKinney\u2019s activity, the records show. The agency informed other law enforcement when he promoted a Fourth of July powwow and rodeo on his reservation, and it flagged a speech he delivered at a conference for mining-affected communities.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re being watched, we\u2019re being followed, we\u2019re under the microscope,\u201d McKinney said.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n\n                            \n                                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n\n            First image: Then-Humboldt County Sheriff Mike Allen questioned whether Raymond Mey, a Lithium Americas security contractor, had a state private investigator\u2019s license in a June 2021 email.

In an April 2021 update, for example, he provided an aerial photograph of the protesters\u2019 campsite. Law enforcement agencies worked with Mey, and he pushed to make that relationship closer, seeking \u201can integrated and coordinated law enforcement strategy to deal with the protestors at Thacker Pass.\u201d The records indicate that the FBI was open to him attending its joint terrorism task force.</p>\n\n<p>Mey is not licensed with the Nevada Private Investigators Licensing Board, which is required to perform such work in the state, according to agency records.</p>\n\n<p>Mey said that he didn\u2019t believe he needed a license because he wasn\u2019t pursuing investigations. He said that his advice to the company was to avoid direct conflict with protesters and only call the police when necessary.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n\n                            \n                                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n\n            First image: Gary McKinney, spokesperson for People of Red Mountain.

Two recent fights at the heart of this clash have intersected with Thacker Pass \u2014 one concerning an oil pipeline in the Great Plains and the other over a copper mine in the Southwest.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning in 2016 and continuing for nearly a year, <a href=\"https://americanindian.si.edu/nk360/plains-treaties/dapl\">a large protest camp on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation</a> sought to halt construction of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access Pipeline. Members of the Indigenous-led movement contended that it threatened the region\u2019s water. The protest turned violent, leading to hundreds of arrests. Law enforcement eventually cleared the camp and the pipeline was completed.</p>\n\n<p>Law enforcement agencies feared similar opposition at Thacker Pass, the records show.</p>\n\n<p>In April 2021, Allen, then the local sheriff, and his staff met with Mark Pfeifle, president and CEO of the communications firm Off the Record Strategies, to discuss \u201clessons learned\u201d from the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. Pfeifle, who helped the Bush administration build support for the second Gulf War, <a href=\"https://www.desmog.com/2017/07/20/emails-bush-iraq-war-pr-delve-off-the-record-strategies-dakota-access-pipeline/\">had more recently led a public relations blitz</a> to discredit the Standing Rock protesters. This involved <a href=\"https://grist.org/protest/standing-rock-national-sheriffs-association-tigerswan-dakota-access-pipeline/\">suggesting using a fake news crew</a> and mocking up wanted posters for activists, according to emails obtained by news organizations. Pfeifle sent Allen presentations about the law enforcement response at Standing Rock, including one on \u201cExamples of \u2018Fake News\u2019 and disinformation\u201d from the protesters. \u201cAs always, we stand ready to help your office and your citizens,\u201d he wrote to the sheriff.</p>\n\n<p>The department appears not to have hired Pfeifle, although Allen directed his staff to also meet with Pfeifle\u2019s colleague who worked on the Standing Rock response.</p>\n\n<p>Around July 2021, the Humboldt County Sheriff\u2019s Office held a meeting \u201cto plan for the reality of a large-scale incident at Thacker Pass\u201d similar to the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. Police referred to the ongoing protests on public land at Thacker Pass as an \u201coccupation.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Allen said he didn\u2019t remember meeting with Pfeifle but said he wanted to be prepared for anything. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to expect, but from what we understand, there were professional protestors up there and more were coming in,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Pfeifle didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Members of People of Red Mountain have also traveled to Arizona to object to the development of a controversial copper mine that\u2019s planned in a national forest east of Phoenix. There, some members of the San Carlos Apache Tribe oppose the development because it would destroy an area they use for ceremonies. (In May, <a href=\"https://azmirror.com/2025/05/27/supreme-court-refuses-apache-plea-to-save-oak-flat-from-copper-mining-destruction/\">the Supreme Court handed down a decision</a> allowing a land transfer, removing the final key obstacle to the mine.)</p>\n\n<p>On these trips, Callao and others have frequently found a \u201cnotice of baggage inspection\u201d from the Transportation Security Administration in their checked luggage. She provided ProPublica with photos of five such notices.</p>\n\n<p>An agency spokesperson said that screening equipment does not know to whom the bag belongs when it triggers an alarm, and officers must search it.</p>\n\n<p>To Callao, the surveillance, whether by luggage inspection, security camera or counterterrorism task force, adds to the weight placed on Indigenous communities amid the energy transition.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to accept the burden of the climate crisis,\u201d Callao said, \u201cWe should be able to protect our ancestral homelands.\u201d</p>",

When we played a kids\u2019 game, the dark clouds parted and my life took a radical turn</p><p>I was halfway through a yoga session when it happened. I was sitting opposite a stranger and we were about to do a clapping exercise together, like a child\u2019s game of pat-a-cake. I didn\u2019t feel awkward, or silly; I went for it and gave it everything. It was as if the clouds parted and the sunlight shone through. I felt a huge sense of relief, as if I had just found something I had been looking for.</p><p>I was in my late 20s, and I\u2019d had chronic depression since my teens. It would come in waves, and I could see another wave heading towards me. After a photography degree, and a couple of years working at a picture library, I had been desperate to break into the media and, in 2003, I was really excited about getting a job on a magazine picture desk. It felt like an achievement and a lucky break in a competitive industry, but I soon discovered its office was not a great place to be.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/23/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-clapped-my-hands-and-hit-the-brakes-on-years-of-depression\">Continue reading...</a>",

Authorities noticed the vehicle was running and unlocked, and the keys were left in the ignition.</p>\n        <p>According to deputies, while they were examining the baby, 28-year-old Clarisse Finnegan exited the bar and told authorities she owned the car. The woman reportedly further said her husband, 60-year-old Norman Finnegan Jr., was inside the bar.</p>\n        <p>A witness allegedly noticed the vehicle at around 10 p.m. when she arrived at the bar, and a man came out approximately 15 minutes later, looked inside, and then went back into the bar.</p>\n        <p>According to the sheriff\u2019s office, Finnegan said she first went to the bar to use the restroom and to get money from her husband to purchase necessities for the baby. She reportedly said she checked on the infant and then went inside the bar to see if her husband was ready to leave. Finnegan Jr. allegedly paid for his tab before his wife went outside and was taken into custody for questioning.</p>\n        <p>The sheriff\u2019s office said the couple provided conflicting statements about Finnegan\u2019s timing in the bar. Witnesses reportedly claimed they saw both Finnegan and her husband drinking inside the establishment.</p>\n        <p>Authorities arrested the couple, and they were charged with felony child neglect without great bodily harm. Finnegan Jr. was released on $2,500 bond, while his wife was released on her own recognizance.</p>\n        <p>Sheriff Rick Staly said, \"These two will never receive parents of the year award with this behavior.

Rollins oversees the wildland firefighting workforce at the U.S. Forest Service, a subagency of the Department of Agriculture. Rollins had noted in her remarks that the administration had exempted firefighters from a federal hiring freeze, and she claimed that the administration was outdoing its predecessor: \u201cWe have reached 96% of our hiring goal, far outpacing the rate of hiring and onboarding over the past three years and in the previous administration.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the Forest Service\u2019s assertions have gotten even more optimistic: The agency now claims it has reached <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/fire/workforce\">99% of its firefighting hiring goal</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But according to internal data obtained by ProPublica, Rollins\u2019 characterization is dangerously misleading. She omitted a wave of resignations from the agency this spring and that many senior management positions remain vacant. Layoffs by the Department of Government Efficiency, voluntary deferred resignations and early retirements have severely hampered the wildland firefighting force. According to the internal national data, which has not been previously reported, more than 4,500 Forest Service firefighting jobs \u2014 as many as 27% \u2014 remained vacant as of July 17. A Forest Service employee who is familiar with the data said it comes from administrators who input staffing information into a computer tool used to create organization charts. The employee said that while the data could contain inaccuracies in certain forests, it broadly reflects the agency\u2019s desired staffing levels. The employee said the data showing \u201cactive\u201d unfilled positions was \u201ccurrent and up-to-date for last week.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The Department of Agriculture disputes that assessment, but the figures are supported by anecdotal accounts from wildland firefighters in New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, California and Wyoming. According to a recent survey by Forest Service fire managers in California, 26% of engine captain positions and 42% of engineer positions were vacant. A veteran Forest Service firefighter in California characterized the Trump administration\u2019s current estimate of the size of its firefighting workforce as \u201cgrossly inaccurate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Last week, Tom Schultz, the chief of the Forest Service, circulated a letter to high-ranking officials in the agency that underscored the dire moment. \u201cAs expected, the 2025 Fire Year is proving to be extremely challenging,\u201d wrote Schultz in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by ProPublica. \u201cWe know the demand for resources outpaces their availability.\u201d Schultz at once directed staff to employ full suppression \u2014 stomping out fires as quickly as possible, instead of letting them burn for the sake of landscape management \u2014 and acknowledged that the resources necessary to pursue such an aggressive strategy were lacking. All options were on the table, he wrote, including directing human-resources employees to fight fires and asking recently departed employees with firefighting qualifications to return to work.</p>\n\n<p>When asked about the discrepancy between Schultz\u2019s memo and Rollins\u2019 public statements on firefighting staffing at the Forest Service, an agency spokesperson said that Schultz was referring to employees who can be called on to bolster the agency\u2019s response \u201cas fire activity increases,\u201d while Rollins was pointing only to full-time firefighters. \u201cThe Forest Service remains fully equipped and operationally ready to protect people and communities from wildfire,\u201d the spokesperson said, noting that \u201cmany individuals that have separated from the Agency either through retirements or voluntary resignations still possess active wildland fire qualifications and are making themselves available to support fire response operations.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The federal government employs thousands of wildland firefighters, but the precise number is opaque. Throughout the Department of the Interior, which is overseen by Secretary Doug Burgum, there are about 5,800 wildland firefighters in four agencies that have been impacted by cuts. An employee at a national park in Colorado that is threatened by wildfire said that they were \u201cseverely understaffed during the Biden administration on most fronts, and now it\u2019s so much worse than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But the Forest Service is by far the largest employer of wildland firefighters, and it has long used gymnastic arithmetic to paint an optimistic picture of its staffing. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/wildfires-forest-service-firefighters-preparedness-level-five\">Last summer, ProPublica reported</a> that the Forest Service under President Joe Biden had overstated its capacity. Robert Kuhn, a former Forest Service official who between 2009 and 2011 co-authored an assessment of the agency\u2019s personnel needs, recently said that the practice of selectively counting firefighters dates back years. \u201cWhat the public needs to understand is, that is just a very small number of what is needed every summer,\u201d he said. Riva Duncan, a retired Forest Service fire chief and the vice president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a labor advocacy organization, said staffing is a constant frustration for managers on the ground. \u201cWe have engines that are completely unstaffed,\u201d said Duncan, who remains active in wildland firefighting, having worked in temporary roles this summer. \u201cWe have vacant positions in management.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That said, there is a difference this fire season from years past. Officials in the previous administration <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/wildland-firefighters\">publicly acknowledged the danger</a> presented by an exodus of experienced wildland firefighters. The Trump administration has taken a different approach \u2014 claiming to have solved the problem while simultaneously exacerbating it. When asked about the staffing cuts, Anna Kelly, a White House deputy press secretary, wrote, \u201cPresident Trump is proud of all Secretary Rollins has accomplished to improve forest management, including by ending the 2001 <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/06/23/secretary-rollins-rescinds-roadless-rule-eliminating-impediment-responsible-forest-management#:~:text=Secretary%20Rollins%20Rescinds%20Roadless%20Rule%2C%20Eliminating%20Impediment%20to%20Responsible%20Forest%20Management,-Press%20Release\">Roadless Rule</a> for stronger fire prevention, and Secretary Burgum\u2019s great work protecting our nation\u2019s treasured public lands.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In March, Congress finally codified a permanent raise for federal wildland firefighters via the appropriations process, a change that advocates have sought for years. In her remarks in June, Rollins credited the president: \u201cOut of gratitude for the selfless service of our Forest Service firefighters, President Trump permanently increased the pay for our federal wildland firefighters.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But in February, the Trump administration laid off about <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-doge-cuts-forest-service-firefighting\">700 employees</a> who support wildland fire operations, from human-resource managers to ecologists and trail-crew workers. Those employees possess what are known as red cards \u2014 certifications that allow them to work on fire crews. Many were subsequently rehired, but the administration then pushed Forest Service employees to accept deferred resignations and early retirements.</p>\n\n<p>Last month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to combine their firefighting forces. For the moment, it\u2019s unknown what form that restructuring will take, but many Forest Service firefighters are anticipating further staffing cuts. A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior wrote, \u201cWe are taking steps to unify federal wildfire programs to streamline bureaucracy.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Administration officials have maintained that employees primarily assigned to wildland fire were exempted from the resignation offers this spring. But according to another internal data set obtained by ProPublica, of the more than 4,000 Forest Service employees who accepted deferred resignations and early retirements, approximately 1,600 had red cards. (A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture wrote that the actual number was 1,400, adding that 85 of them \u201chave decided to return for the season.\u201d)</p>\n\n<p>Even those figures don\u2019t account for all the lost institutional knowledge. The departures included meteorologists who provided long-range forecasts, allowing fire managers to decide where to deploy crews. One of the meteorologists who left was Charles Maxwell, who had for more than 20 years interpreted weather models predicting summer monsoons at the Southwest Coordination Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, an interagency office. The thunderstorms can fuel wildfire, with lightning and wind, and extinguish them, with great rains. Lately, according to Maxwell, the monsoons have become less and less reliable, and understanding their nuances can be challenging. Maxwell said that he\u2019d already been planning to retire next year. But he also said he \u201cwas concerned with the degree of chaos, the potential degradation of services and what would happen to my job.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Maxwell noted that his work had been covered by knowledgeable fill-ins from out of state. But another firefighter who worked on blazes in New Mexico said that Maxwell\u2019s understanding of the monsoon had been missed. A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, which oversees the interagency office where Maxwell worked, wrote, \u201cWe do not comment on personnel matters.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The monsoon season is now here and has brought deadly flash flooding along old burn scars in Ruidoso, New Mexico, while distributing sporadic rain in the state\u2019s Gila National Forest.</p>\n\n<p>It is shaping up to be a severe fire season. On Monday, federal firefighters reported 86 new fires across the West; by Tuesday, there were 105 more. And there\u2019s already been some criticism of the federal response. Arizona\u2019s governor and members of Congress have called for an investigation into the Park Service\u2019s handling of a blaze this month that leveled a historic lodge on the Grand Canyon\u2019s North Rim. Last month, Rollins acknowledged, \u201cFires don\u2019t know Republican or Democrat, or which side of the aisle you are on.\u201d This much, at least, is true.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/ellis-simani\">Ellis Simani</a> contributed data analysis.</p>",

It could also, in time, require states to allow more launches or even more launch sites \u2014 known as spaceports \u2014 along their coastlines.</p>\n\n<p>The order is a step toward the rollback of federal oversight that Musk, who has fought bitterly with the Federal Aviation Administration over his space operations, and others have pushed for. Commercial rocket launches have grown exponentially more frequent in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Critics warn such a move could have dangerous consequences.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt would not be reasonable for them to be rescinding regulations that are there to protect the public interest, and the public, from harm,\u201d said Jared Margolis, a senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit that works to protect animals and the environment. \u201cAnd that\u2019s my fear here: Are they going to change things in a way that puts people at risk, that puts habitats and wildlife at risk?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The White House did not answer questions about the draft order.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Trump administration is committed to cementing America\u2019s dominance in space without compromising public safety or national security,\u201d said White House spokesperson Kush Desai. \u201cUnless announced by President Trump, however, discussion about any potential policy changes should be deemed speculation.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The order would give Trump even more direct control over the space industry\u2019s chief regulator by turning the civil servant position leading the FAA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/elon-musk-spacex-doge-faa-ast-regulation-spaceflight-trump\">Office of Commercial Space Transportation</a> into a political appointment. The last head of the office and two other top officials recently took voluntary separation offers.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The order would also create a new adviser to the transportation secretary to shepherd in deregulation of the space industry.</p>\n\n<p>The draft order comes as SpaceX is ramping up its ambitious project to build a reusable deep-space rocket to carry people to Earth\u2019s orbit, the moon and eventually Mars. The rocket, called Starship, is the largest, most powerful ever built, standing 403 feet tall with its booster. The company has hit some milestones but has also been beset by problems, as three of the rockets launched from Texas this year have exploded \u2014 disrupting air traffic and raining debris on beaches and roads in the Caribbean and Gulf waters.</p>\n\n<p>The draft order also seeks to restrict the authority of state coastal officials who have challenged commercial launch companies like SpaceX, documents show. It could lead to federal officials interfering with state efforts to enforce their environmental rules when they conflict with the construction or operation of spaceports.</p>\n\n<p>Derek Brockbank, executive director for the Coastal States Organization, said the proposed executive order could ultimately force state commissions to prioritize spaceport infrastructure over other land uses, such as renewable energy, waterfront development or coastal restoration, along the coastline. His nonprofit represents 34 coastal states and territories.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that it could potentially undermine the rights of a state to determine how it wants its coast used, which was the very fundamental premise of the congressionally authorized Coastal Zone Management Act,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t see any president, no matter what their party is, coming in and saying, \u2018This is what a state should prioritize or should do.\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<p>SpaceX is already suing the California Coastal Commission, accusing the agency of political bias and interference with the company\u2019s efforts to increase the number of Falcon 9 rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base. The reusable Falcon 9 is SpaceX\u2019s workhorse rocket, ferrying satellites to orbit and astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>\n\n<p>The changes outlined in the order would greatly benefit SpaceX, which launches far more rockets into space than any other company in the U.S. But it would also help rivals such as Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin and California-based Rocket Lab. The companies have been pushing to pare down oversight for years, warning that the U.S. is racing with China to return to the moon \u2014 in hopes of mining resources like water and rare earth metals and using it as a stepping stone to Mars \u2014 and could lose if regulations don\u2019t allow U.S. companies to move faster, said Dave Cavossa, president of the Commercial Space Federation, a trade group that represents eight launch companies, including SpaceX, Blue Origin and Rocket Lab.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt sounds like they\u2019ve been listening to industry, because all of those things are things that we\u2019ve been advocating for strongly,\u201d Cavossa said when asked about the contents of the draft order.</p>\n\n<p>Cavossa said he sees \u201csome sort of environmental review process\u201d continuing to take place. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about doing is right-sizing it,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>He added, \u201cWe can\u2019t handle a yearlong delay for launch licenses.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The former head of the FAA\u2019s commercial space office said <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/testimony/statement-kelvin-b-coleman-associate-administrator-commercial-space-transportation-faa-0\">at a Congressional hearing last September</a> that the office took an average of 151 days to issue a new license during the previous 11 years.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial space launches have boomed in recent years \u2014 from 26 in 2019 to 157 last year. <a href=\"https://explore.dot.gov/t/FAA/views/CommercialSpaceTransportation/Main?%3Aembed=y&amp;%3Aiid=1&amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y#1\">With more than 500 total launches</a>, mostly from Texas, Florida and California, SpaceX has been responsible for the lion\u2019s share, <a href=\"https://explore.dot.gov/t/FAA/views/CommercialSpaceTransportation/Main?%3Aembed=y&amp;%3Aiid=1&amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y#1\">according to FAA data</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But the company has tangled with the FAA, which last year proposed fining it $633,000 for violations related to two of its launches. The FAA did not answer a question last week about the status of the proposed fine.</p>\n\n<p>SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab and the FAA did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, the FAA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106193.pdf\">environmental reviews</a> look at 14 types of potential impacts that include air and water quality, noise pollution and land use, and provide details about the launches that are not otherwise available. They have at times drawn big responses from the public.</p>\n\n<p>When SpaceX sought to increase its Starship launches in Texas from five to 25 a year, residents and government agencies submitted thousands of comments. Most of the nearly 11,400 publicly posted comments opposed the increase, a ProPublica analysis found. The FAA approved the increase anyway earlier this year. After conducting an environmental assessment for the May launch of SpaceX\u2019s Starship Flight 9 from Texas, the FAA released documents that revealed as many as 175 airline flights could be disrupted and Turks and Caicos\u2019 Providenciales International Airport would need to close during the launch.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to seeking to cut short environmental reviews, the executive order would open the door for the federal government to rescind sections of the federal rule that seeks to keep the public safe during launches and reentries.</p>\n\n<p>The rule, referred to as Part 450, was approved during Trump\u2019s first term and aimed to streamline commercial space regulations and speed approvals of launches. But the rule soon fell out of favor with launch companies, which said the FAA didn\u2019t provide enough guidance on how to comply and was taking too long to review applications.</p>\n\n<p>Musk helped lead the charge. Last September, he told attendees at a conference in Los Angeles, \u201cIt really should not be possible to build a giant rocket faster than paper can move from one desk to another.\u201d He called for the resignation of the head of the FAA, who stepped down as Trump took office.</p>\n\n<p>Other operators have expressed similar frustration, and some members of Congress have signaled support for an overhaul. In February, Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., <a href=\"https://republicans-science.house.gov/_cache/files/f/7/f722d474-0997-430c-8cc3-7554c4dd5829/B6133FA0A66669E002C1F483872D2B627B4C1B724591D570E2C1E8B8504D0CEA.gao-letter-on-part-450---clean-25-02-12.pdf\">signed a letter asking</a> the Government Accountability Office to review the process for approving commercial launches and reentries.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>In their letter, Babin and Lofgren wrote they wanted to understand whether the rules are \u201ceffectively and efficiently accommodating United States commercial launch and reentry operations, especially as the cadence and technological diversity of such operations continues to increase.</p>\n\n<p>The draft executive order directs the secretary of transportation to \u201creevaluate, amend, or rescind\u201d sections of Part 450 to \u201cenable a diversified set of operators to achieve an increase in commercial space launch cadence and novel space activities by an order of magnitude by 2030.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The order also directs the Department of Commerce to streamline regulation of novel space activity, which experts say could include things like mining or making repairs in space, that doesn\u2019t fall under other regulations.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/brandon-roberts\">Brandon Roberts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/pratheek-rebala\">Pratheek Rebala</a> contributed data analysis.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>Is anyone surprised that Russian President Vladimir Putin so badly overestimated his ability to continue to string along U.S. President Donald Trump? Shocked that Putin has once again become the victim of the echo chamber that he created for himself? Is anyone really surprised that Putin, who so badly miscalculated in February 2022 when he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has again made a serious strategic mistake by failing to take openings offered to him by the U.S. President to end the war in Ukraine?</p><p>Putin's failures are actually years in the making. After assuming power in the early 2000\u2019s, he surrounded himself with sycophants and \u201cloyal\u201d servants who were unwilling to give him bad news, and always ready to repeat the lies and distortions the Russian leader wanted to promote. Anyone who dared disagree with him was either thrown in jail, forced into exile or assassinated by the Russian \u201cstrongman\u201d. </p><p>As a result, in the run up to Putin\u2019s failed February 2022 effort to seize all of Ukraine, there is little doubt that his advisors parroted back to him the things he wanted to hear.  I can imagine what that sounded like. <em>\u201cThe Ukrainian people love Russia and will welcome Russian forces invading their country with \u2018Bread and Salt\u2019;\u201d \u201cUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a \u201cpuppet\u201d placed on his throne by Washington and his unpopular government is incapable of standing up to the great Tsar Vladimir;\u201d \u201cUkraine\u2019s western provided weapons are no match for Russia\u2019s incredible arsenal;\u201d \u201cUkraine\u2019s Armed Forces cannot stand up to the Russian Military, which is the best in the world;\u201d \u201cThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was a weak organization that would collapse under the weight of Moscow\u2019s greatness and would never stand up to Putin over Ukraine\u201d.</em> I could go on.</p><p>Instead of being met with \u2018Bread and Salt\u2019 in the winter of 2022, Russian forces were greeted with Javelins, Stingers, and Bayraktar Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and highly motivated Ukrainian forces that humiliated the Russians on the battlefield and stopped Moscow from achieving its initial objectives. More than three years later, the Russian people have suffered over a million Russian casualties and now face serious social and economic problems.</p><p>When President Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, it appeared Putin\u2019s echo chamber once again failed the Russian President, who was apparently convinced that he could deceive and manipulate Trump endlessly by pretending to want to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine, while continuing to launch attacks on Ukraine day and night.</p><p>For months, President Trump and his Administration tried to look past Putin\u2019s deceitful behavior. The U.S. president appeared willing to \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d when Putin blatantly insulted him by launching strikes while Trump\u2019s Special Envoy was in Moscow to \u201ctalk peace\u201d and Trump\u2019s emissaries were in Kyiv to encourage the Ukrainians to consider making compromises to end the war. Fueled by his own arrogance and lacking advisors around him who will speak the truth, Putin repeatedly insulted the U.S. president and the people who elected him to lead the United States. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong></em><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></em></u></a></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>If the Russians really understood what they were dealing with in President Trump, Putin would have known that there was a limit to what he could get away with vis-a-vis his American counterpart. Instead, his complete failure to understand the dynamics in the U.S. and Trump\u2019s own personality has finally led to the U.S. president turning a corner \u2014 recently announcing his support for continued military support to the Ukrainians in their fight to defend their country against Putin\u2019s aggression, and his willingness to seriously consider adopting secondary sanctions that will place increased pressure on the already struggling Russian economy. </p><p>Trump is calling Putin\u2019s bluff, and the Russian people will once again pay the price for their \u201cleader\u2019s\u201d lack of judgement and self-awareness.</p><p>For those Americans who support continued U.S. assistance to Ukraine and recognize that the loss of Ukraine to Putin will have dire consequences for the U.S. far beyond the battlefield, the U.S. president\u2019s recent shift in thinking is a very welcome sign that the White House understands that in any confrontation with Putin, the U.S. can and will demonstrate the fortitude and stamina needed to counter the Russian dictator\u2019s imperial ambitions and that Washington will not tolerate being insulted by Putin. </p><p>Continued supplies of defense weapons, the removal of Biden-era restrictions on how the Ukrainians can use U.S. weapons systems, and increased economic pressure on the Russian regime are all important steps that the U.S. can now take to demonstrate to Putin that he is wrong if he thinks he can bully the American people and their elected leaders. </p><p>But there is another tool that President Trump can also use to increase pressure on Putin \u2013 his own voice.</p><p>During the 2016 U.S. Presidential elections, then-candidate Trump openly spoke about his desire to forge better relations with Russia. After his election, he continued to try to improve relations with Moscow despite facing significant attacks from his political opponents in Washington. As a result, during Trump\u2019s first term in office he was very popular among the Russian people, who were hopeful that their government would take advantage of Trump\u2019s positive feelings about their country and take advantage of the opening Trump was offering to improve their lives. </p><p>After being re-elected to the White House in 2024, the Russians were once again offered an opportunity to reduce tensions with the U.S. and roll-back economic sanctions and the diplomatic isolation that have undermined the hopes many Russians had in the past of living a better life. Between January and June 2025, Trump offered Putin multiple openings to find an off-ramp to the costly war in Ukraine. Putin not only failed to take advantage of the opportunities presented by Trump, but he openly thumbed his nose at the U.S. president.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

His message then was clear \u2013 The United States is not your enemy. Your enemy is the corrupt regime that denies you basic liberties and has dragged you into an expensive arms race with the United States that is robbing you of your ability to enjoy a better life. </p><p>During that era, Reagan used every possible means to communicate his message to the Soviet people and by the early 1990s, his strategic messaging campaign worked, when the people of the Soviet Union rose up against their jailers and demanded an end to the Communist Party\u2019s control over their lives. </p><p>President Trump should follow Reagan\u2019s example and look for every opportunity to communicate to the Russian people that it is Putin, not Trump, who refuses to engage in negotiations aimed at improving their lives. It is Putin, driven by his selfish arrogance and detachment from reality, who is squandering Russia\u2019s future. </p><p>Washington is ready to work with Russia \u2013 but only when Russia ends its attacks on its neighbors and demonstrates a sincere willingness to settle its differences with those neighbors via peaceful means, versus costly military conflicts that result in the senseless death and suffering of the average Russian, who under current circumstances will never see any benefit from Putin\u2019s war.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>\u201cGovernment has assured emaSwati [the Swazi people] that the arrival [in southern Africa Wednesday in Eswatini, formerly Swaziland] of five third-country deportees from the United States of America poses no security threat to the Nation. Government said these deportees are in transit and will be repatriated to their respective countries. Government has, however, acknowledged the security concerns of emaSwati, further confirming that indeed, the five prisoners are in the country and are housed in Correctional facilities within isolated units, where similar offenders are kept. The Nation is assured that these inmates pose no threat to the country or its citizens.\u201d</p><p>That was Eswatini government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli, confirming last week, the transfer from the U.S. of five immigrant criminals who were citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos.</p><p>Mdluli said their presence in Eswatini was \u201cthe result of months of robust high-level engagements between the U.S. Government and Eswatini,\u201d and that, \u201cThe two Governments will collaborate with the [United Nations] International Organization for Migration (IOM) to facilitate the transit of these inmates to their countries of origin.\"</p><p>Last Thursday, an IOM spokesperson said that the agency \u201cwas not involved in this operation and has not been requested to provide post-removal assistance,\u201d but \u201cas always, stands ready to support Member States.\u201d</p><p>The State Department\u2019s 2023 <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/eswatini/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Human Rights Repor</u></a>t's section on Eswatini noted \u201ccredible reports of: arbitrary or unlawful killings, including extrajudicial killings; torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government.\"</p><p>Last Wednesday, Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin described the five as \u201cindividuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back,\u201d adding, \u201cThese depraved monsters have been terrorizing American communities, but thanks to POTUS [President Trump] and [Homeland Security Secretary Kristi] Noem, they are off of American soil.\u201d</p><p>While much has been written about the law covering domestic activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) here in the U.S., there are still procedural questions about the Trump administration\u2019s decision to send migrant criminals to third countries, a move covered by different American laws and international conventions.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

No such agreement has been made public.  Some analysts suggest Eswatini may be trying to safeguard sugar exports to the U.S. \u2014 the small African country\u2019s fourth largest customer \u2014 from new Trump tariffs.</p><p>The Eswatini government has declined to say whether any money from Washington came as part of the deal. The question was raised because there was a $6 million U.S. payment acknowledged in the Trump administration\u2019s February 2025 arrangement with El Salvador, which involved sending up to 300 Venezuelan deportees to that country.</p><p>Money has also been raised because of the reputation of Eswatini\u2019s 57-year-old King Mswati III, the last remaining absolute monarch in Africa, who has a family that includes 15 wives. He is accused by human rights groups of enjoying a lavish lifestyle, while most of the country\u2019s 1.2 million people are impoverished.</p><p>Last Friday, <em><em>Newzroom Afrika</em></em>, South Africa's 24-hour digital television news channel, carried an interview with Ramza Matimela, the Secretary General of Swaziland Liberation Movement, who is now living in exile in Ireland. He said, \u201cWe know very well that we have got a greedy leader who wants to accumulate everything for himself\u2026Again, we have a government that is trying to please everyone at the expense of its own people.\u201d</p><p>Eswatini is not the only African country the Trump administration has approached to take migrant criminals. According to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/u-s-pushes-more-african-countries-to-accept-deported-migrants-b6f330c5?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiqTzuhk_XU-kJ-QrOHc3XDAG6Pr2Diy2wqy39Zc3xNgRPZ5YChuPrsWuSLDBw%3D&amp;gaa_ts=687ddbd4&amp;gaa_sig=dgp5qQydmBloKZcDTnExveJOIy3DJAMkMXkhl_v4K7huwa60s-5OqRYee2a2BW_205JeyOPtecnhMPu6JiLEDA%3D%3D\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></em></u></a>, the administration asked five West African countries to accept deportees from the U.S. whose home countries refused them or were slow to take them back \u2014 before their leaders met with Trump on July 9.</p><p>President Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 of Guinea Bissau said Trump discussed the topic during the summit, but did not specifically ask the African nations to agree to accept deportees, according to press reports.</p><p> On July 10, Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar said in an interview that his country had rejected a proposal from the U.S. to accept deported Venezuelans, including some with criminal records.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

They were convicted of serious crimes in the United States, though many had either finished or were about to finish serving their sentences. One was from South Sudan, but the others were from Cuba, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam. They were to be deported on May 20 to South Sudan, a war-torn country that recently emerged from civil war.</p><p>Take a moment to consider the legal situation and the laws involved.</p><p>Under the Immigration Act, the U.S. Government can conduct what is known as a \u201cthird country removal,\u201d to any country with a government that will accept the illegal alien. This is permissible if the individual will not be accepted by his/her country of origin. </p><p>The non-citizen facing removal, under domestic and international law, can claim, if given the opportunity, that there are substantial grounds that he/she would be in danger of torture or cruel punishment in the proposed third country.</p><p>On May 20, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts, who in April had issued a temporary restraining order that barred any migrant deportations from the U.S. to countries other than their own, held an emergency hearing on the South Sudan eight. At that hearing, a lawyer for the Vietnam deportee said his client was given less than 24 hours' notice of his removal, and had no ability to contest it in his native language.</p><p>It turned out that notice of their deportation was provided to the detainees at 5:45 p.m. for a 9:35 a.m. departure the next morning without access to an attorney.</p><p>The next day, Judge Murphy ruled that the South Sudan eight fell under his April order barring migrant deportations and that they should be held for interviews. As a result of Judge Murphy\u2019s order, the aircraft carrying the eight from Texas to South Sudan was diverted to an American military base in Djibouti, Africa. There the eight remained under guard for weeks while the Trump Administration took their case opposing Judge Murphy\u2019s restraining order on an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><p>On June 23, by a 6-to-3 vote, the Supreme Court Justices reversed Judge Murphy\u2019s order requiring the government to halt third country deportations until there was settlement on the pending legal issue that migrants are required to have a \"meaningful opportunity\" to tell officials what risks they might face being deported to a third country.</p><p>The Justices in the majority did not give their reasoning. But Justice Sotomayer, joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, wrote an 18-page dissent that in one part pointed out, \u201cRather than allowing our lower court colleagues to manage this high-stakes litigation with the care and attention it plainly requires [meaning the underlying issue of requiring a chance to challenge deportation], this Court now intervenes to grant the Government emergency relief from an order [Murphy\u2019s temporary restraining order] it has repeatedly defied. I cannot join so gross an abuse of the Court\u2019s equitable discretion.\u201d</p><p>I point out that while the South Sudan eight are now in that country facing an unknown fate, there remains the basic legal case at the District Court level of whether the U.S. Government is required by law to give potential third country deportees an opportunity to object.</p><p>As Justice Sotomayor put it, \u201cPlaintiffs alleged that the Government\u2019s apparent policy of removing noncitizens to a third country without notice or the opportunity to file a claim under the [International] Convention violated the immigration laws, the regulations implementing the Convention, and the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Among other things, plaintiffs sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief preventing their own removal and the removal of putative class members without adequate notice and a \u2018meaningful opportunity\u2019 to present a claim under the Convention.\u201d</p><p>I should point out again that one of the South Sudan eight was originally from that country, but on July 16, <em><em>New Yorker Magazine </em></em>reported that, \u201ctheir families have reportedly not heard from them since their arrival [July 8] in that country.</p><p>While those families still have a lot of questions, it's the legal answers that will have the most impact moving forward.</p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

Sign up for <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/newsletters/briefweekly/\">The Brief Weekly</a> to get up to speed on their essential coverage of Texas issues.</p>\n\n            \n\n                \n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n                    \n<p>Sixteen months had passed since Hurricane Harvey tore through the Texas coast in August 2017, killing more than 80 people and flattening entire neighborhoods. And when Texas lawmakers gathered in Austin for their biennial session, the scale of the storm\u2019s destruction was hard to ignore. </p>\n\n<p>Legislators responded by greenlighting a yearslong statewide initiative to evaluate flood risks and improve preparedness for increasingly frequent and deadly storms. \u201cIf we get our planning right on the front end and prevent more damage on the front end, then we have less on the back end,\u201d Charles Perry, a Republican senator from Lubbock who chairs a committee overseeing environmental issues, said at the time.</p>\n\n<p>In the years that followed, hundreds of local officials and volunteers canvassed communities across Texas, mapping out vulnerabilities. The result of their work came in 2024 with the release of <a href=\"https://www.twdb.texas.gov/flood/planning/sfp/2024/doc/SFP-2024.pdf\">Texas\u2019 first-ever state flood plan</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Their findings identified nearly $55 billion in proposed projects and outlined 15 key recommendations, including nine suggestions for legislation. Several were aimed at aiding rural communities like Kerr County, where flash flooding over the Fourth of July weekend killed more than 100 people. Three are still missing. </p>\n\n<p>But this year, lawmakers largely ignored those recommendations<strong>.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Instead, the legislative session that ended June 2 was dominated by high-profile battles over school vouchers and lawmakers\u2019 decision to spend $51 billion to maintain and provide new <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/06/04/texas-legislature-property-tax-cuts-2025/\">property tax cuts</a>, an amount nearly equal to the funding identified by the Texas Water Development Board, a state agency that has historically overseen water supply and conservation efforts.</p>\n\n<p>Although it had been only seven years since Hurricane Harvey, legislators now prioritized the state\u2019s water and drought crisis over flooding needs.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Legislators allocated <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/feeds/propublica/%20https:/www.texastribune.org/2025/05/27/texas-water-supply-infrastructure-deal-bill/\">more than $1.6 billion</a> in new revenue for water infrastructure projects, only some of which would go toward flood mitigation. They also passed a bill that will ask voters in November to decide whether to approve $1 billion annually over the next two decades that would prioritize water and wastewater over flood mitigation projects. At that pace, water experts said that it could take decades before existing mitigation needs are addressed \u2014 even without further floods.</p>\n\n<p>Even if they had been approved by lawmakers this year, many of the plan\u2019s recommendations would not have been implemented before the July 4 disaster. But a ProPublica and Texas Tribune analysis of legislative proposals, along with interviews with lawmakers and flood experts, found that the Legislature has repeatedly failed to enact key measures that would help communities prepare for frequent flooding. </p>\n\n<p>Such inaction often hits rural and economically disadvantaged communities hardest because they lack the tax base to fund major flood prevention projects and often cannot afford to produce the data they need to qualify for state and federal grants, environmental experts and lawmakers said.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, legislators have declined to pass at least three bills that would create siren or alert systems, tools experts say <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/07/11/kerr-county-flood-warning-system-sirens/\">can be especially helpful in rural communities</a> that lack reliable internet and cell service.  <a href=\"https://texasfloodassessment.org/doc/State-Flood-Assessment-report-86th-Legislation.pdf\">A 2019 state-commissioned report</a> estimated flood prevention needs at over $30 billion. Since then, lawmakers have allocated just $1.4 billion. And they ignored the key recommendations from the state\u2019s 2024 flood plan that are meant to help rural areas like Kerr County, which is dubbed \u201cFlash Flood Alley\u201d due to its geography.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, left, and U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, right, look on as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signs an emergency proclamation during a press conference in Kerrville.\n    \n            (Ronaldo Bola\u00f1os/The Texas Tribune)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Spokespeople for Gov. Greg Abbott and House Speaker Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock, did not answer questions about why the plan\u2019s recommendations were overlooked but defended the Legislature\u2019s investment in flood mitigation as significant. They pointed to millions more spent on other prevention efforts, including flood control dam construction and maintenance, regional flood projects, and increased floodplain disclosures and drainage requirements for border counties. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick did not respond to questions.</p>\n\n<p>This week, the Legislature will convene for a special session that Abbott called to address a range of priorities, including flood warning systems, natural disaster preparation and relief funding. Patrick <a href=\"https://x.com/americarpts/status/1942272990328283564?s=46&amp;t=5cO7LnTkSwhzxq4gxRk5sg\">promised that the state would purchase</a> warning sirens for counties in flash flood zones. Similar efforts, however, have previously been rejected by the Legislature. Alongside Burrows, Patrick also announced the formation of committees on disaster preparedness and flooding and <a href=\"https://www.ltgov.texas.gov/2025/07/10/texas-senate-and-texas-house-announce-creation-of-select-committees-on-disaster-preparedness-and-flooding/\">called the move</a> \u201cjust the beginning of the Legislature looking at every aspect of this tragic event.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/texas-news/texas-senate-house-committee-flood-warning-system/3885139/\">Burrows said</a> the House is \u201cready to better fortify our state against future disasters.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But Rep. Ana-Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez Ramos, a Democrat from Richardson, near Dallas, said state lawmakers have brushed off dire flood prevention needs for decades. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe manual was there, and we ignored it, and we've continued to ignore these recommendations,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez Ramos, who has served on the House Natural Resources Committee overseeing water issues for three sessions. \u201cIt\u2019s performative to say we\u2019re trying to do something knowing well we\u2019re not doing enough.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>One recommendation from the 2024 flood plan would have cost the state nothing to enact. It called for granting counties the authority to levy drainage fees, including in unincorporated areas, that could fund local flood projects. Only about 150 of 1,450 Texas cities and counties have dedicated drainage fees, according to a study cited in the state assessment.</p>\n\n<p>Kerr, a conservative county of 53,000 people, has struggled to gain support for projects that would raise taxes. About a week after the flooding, some <a href=\"https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2025/07/17/kerr-county-protesters-want-to-stop-possible-property-tax-increase-before-it-gets-started/\">residents protested</a> when county commissioners discussed a property tax increase to help cover the costs of recovery efforts. </p>\n\n<p>The inability to raise such fees is one of the biggest impediments for local governments seeking to fund flood mitigation projects, said Robert R. Puente, a Democrat and former state representative who once chaired the state committee responsible for water issues. Lawmakers\u2019 resistance to such efforts is rooted in fiscal conservatism, said Puente, who now heads the San Antonio Water System. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s mostly because of a philosophy that the leadership in Austin has right now, that under no circumstances are we going to raise taxes, and under most circumstances we\u2019re not even going to allow local governments to have control over how they raise taxes or implement fees,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Another one of the flood plan\u2019s recommendations called for lawmakers to allocate money for a technical assistance program to help underresourced and rural governments better manage flood prone areas, which requires implementing a slew of standards to ensure safe development in those hazardous zones. Doing this work requires local officials to collect accurate mapping that shows the risk of flooding. Passing this measure could have helped counties like Kerr with that kind of data collection, which the plan recognized is especially challenging for rural and economically disadvantaged communities. </p>\n\n<p>Insufficient information impacts Texas\u2019s ability to fully understand flood risks statewide. The water board\u2019s plan, for example, includes roughly 600 infrastructure projects across Texas in need of completion. But its report acknowledged that antiquated or missing data meant another 3,100 assessments would be required to know whether additional projects are needed.</p>\n\n<p>In the Guadalupe River region, which includes Kerr County, 65% of areas lacked adequate flood mapping. Kerrville, the county seat, was listed among the areas identified as having the \u201cgreatest known flood risks and mitigation needs.\u201d Yet of the 19 flood needs specific to the city and county, only three were included in the state plan\u2019s list of 600. They included requests to install backup generators in critical facilities and repair low-water crossings, which are shallow points in streets where rainwater can pool to dangerous levels.</p>\n\n<p>At least 16 other priorities, including the county\u2019s desire for an early warning flood system and potential dam or drainage system repairs, required a follow-up evaluation, according to the state plan. County officials <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/07/10/texas-kerr-county-commissioners-flooding-warning/\">tried to obtain grants for the early warning systems for years</a>, to no avail.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Trees uprooted by floodwaters lie across a field in Hunt in Kerr Country on July 5.\n    \n            (Brenda Baz\u00e1n for The Texas Tribune)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Gonzales County, an agriculture-rich area of 20,000 people along the Guadalupe River, is among the rural communities struggling to obtain funding, said emergency management director Jimmy Harless, who is also the county\u2019s fire marshal. The county is in desperate need of a siren system and additional gauges to measure the river\u2019s potentially dangerous flood levels, Harless said, but doesn\u2019t have the resources, personnel or expertise to apply for the \u201cburdensome\u201d state grant process. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is extremely frustrating for me to know that there\u2019s money there and there\u2019s people that care, but our state agency has become so bureaucratic that it\u2019s just not feasible for us,\u201d Harless said. \u201cOur folks\u2019 lives are more important than what some bureaucrat wants us to do.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>For years, Texas leaders have focused more on cleaning up after disasters than on preparing for them, said Jim Blackburn, a professor at Rice University specializing in environmental law and flooding issues.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the Guadalupe is prone to flash flooding. That\u2019s been known for decades,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cThe state has been very negligent about kind of preparing us for, frankly, the worst storms of the future that we are seeing today because of climate change, and what\u2019s changing is that the risks are just greater today and will be even greater tomorrow, because our storms are getting worse and worse.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>At a news conference this month, Abbott said state committees would investigate \u201cways to address this,\u201d though he declined to offer specifics. When pressed by a reporter about where the blame for the lack of preparedness should fall, Abbott responded that it was \u201cthe word choice of losers.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It shouldn\u2019t have taken the Hill Country flooding for a special session addressing emergency systems and funding needs, said Usman Mahmood, a policy analyst at Bayou City Waterkeeper, a Houston nonprofit that advocates for flood protection measures. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe worst part pretty much already happened, which is the flooding and the loss of life,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s a reaction to that.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Misty Harris contributed research.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION</strong> \u2014 Jesse Owens' historic gold medal victories at the 1936 Berlin Olympics exemplified American repudiation of Nazi ideology and Hitler\u2019s ambition for global dominance. Today, America needs to reframe its approach to the artificial intelligence (AI) race with China with the same mindset. President Xi Jinping envisions a world where the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) uses technological dominance to shape global governance, economic development, and limit individual freedoms that do not serve to empower the CCP. Said more directly \u2014 he wants to control the way we live and work to serve his interests.<br /><br />American policymakers a<sub></sub>nd technologists recognize this threat and frame it as an \"AI Race\" between the U.S. and China. They assert, correctly, that the U.S. must win\u2014but how? </p><p>ChatGPT estimates that the global dialogue about the \"AI Race\" focuses on performance, compute and energy (40-50%); geopolitical strategy and national security (10-15%); ethics, regulation, and AI safety (15-20%); economic and labor market impacts (10-15%); and consumer applications and societal use cases (5-10%). </p><p>To \u2018go for the gold\u2019 and win the AI race, the US must establish the demand signal and set adoption goals. We are in an AI-adoption race, not an AI-infrastructure race. Victory will be determined by how AI is embedded into the way we live, work, and fight. Americans should be asking:</p><ul><li>Will AI enable life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness or will AI limit speech and enhance government surveillance and authoritarian controls?</li><li>Will AI create new jobs, new industries, and previously unimaginable growth or will AI eliminate jobs and fundamentally disrupt the labor-based fabric of our economy?</li><li>Will AI promote peace by improving communication, collaboration, and conflict resolution, or will it incite war through decentralization of military capabilities and autonomous warfare?</li></ul><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><ul></ul><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Sign up for the </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Cyber Initiatives Group</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

They are outcome oriented. In his famous 1961 speech to Congress, President John F. Kennedy committed the nation to the ambitious goal of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth before the decade's end. His vision galvanized national support and spurred significant investment in NASA and space technology, ultimately propelling the U.S. to achieve the historic Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969. President Trump\u2019s impending AI Action Plan should set a similar vision.</p><p>In the race to the moon, the U.S. and Soviet Union poured resources into developing cutting-edge technologies, driven by the belief that victory would symbolize the superiority of their respective political and economic systems. America took advantage of the competition by driving unprecedented innovation that cemented America\u2019s lead in the world\u2014both militarily and commercially.<br /><br />Militarily, the U.S. created a robust and resilient arsenal of nuclear weapon delivery systems that deterred the Soviet Union from preemptive attack. Commercially, the impacts of the space race were wide-ranging:</p><ul><li>Texas Instruments played a key role in the development of integrated circuits and miniaturizing electronic components that laid the groundwork for modern computing and consumer electronics.</li><li>AT&amp;T developed advanced satellite communication technology, including the Telstar satellite, which enabled the first transatlantic television broadcasts and paved the way for global communications.</li><li>DuPont created Teflon, a non-stick coating originally used in spacecraft, which is now widely used in cookware and other applications.</li><li>General Electric made significant contributions to medical imaging technologies, including MRI machines, that have a lasting impact on diagnostic medicine.</li></ul><p>During the space race, the Soviets proved just as capable of achieving major breakthroughs and developing exquisite weapons. However, American dynamism won the Cold War, in part, because our citizens incorporated this technology into their everyday lives, while Soviet citizens queued in long lines for cars, washing machines and televisions. These natural benefits of a capitalist economy won\u2019t ensure victory. China learned from Soviet failures and subsidizes commercial production and adoption. Therefore, the U.S. must be even more ambitious at cultivating AI innovation and unleashing AI-driven opportunities to redefine the way we live and work.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em>Sign up today</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em>.</em></strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>Shifting the Paradigm: From Inputs to Impact</strong></p><p>As we reset our course to win the AI race, we must shift our focus from the intricacies of technological inputs to the broader societal impacts that AI can deliver. Just as the Space Race catalyzed innovation across multiple industries, the AI race presents an opportunity to redefine our geopolitical, economic, and social landscapes. To truly capitalize on this potential, the United States must prioritize outcomes that align with our core values of freedom, innovation, and human dignity. Our ambitions should be both bold and broad. Commercially we should set goals for:</p><ul><li><strong>Individualized Healthcare</strong>: AI-driven solutions that enhance patient care, streamline diagnostics, and personalize treatment plans should improve health outcomes, reduce costs, and increase accessibility to medical services. We should strive to cure cancer within a decade.</li><li><strong>Sustainable Agriculture:</strong> Farmers should use AI-optimized irrigation, pest control, and resource allocation to achieve food security and sustainability for all Americans.</li><li><strong>Advanced Manufacturing:</strong> AI-powered automation and predictive maintenance should power American industries and create 1 million new high-skilled jobs in the next five years.</li></ul><p>We should also set grand ambitions for AI-enabled government outcomes:</p><ul><li><strong>Education and Workforce Development:</strong> Teachers should use AI to tailor educational content and learning experiences to individual needs, ensuring that students and workers acquire the skills necessary for the future job market. The U.S. currently ranks in the middle of OECD countries in reading (13th), science (18th), and math (18th). We should set goals to be in the top 3 for all core subjects.</li><li><strong>Public Health and Safety:</strong> Medical and safety professionals should use AI to predict and manage public health crises, optimize resource allocation, and improve response times. AI can assist in early detection of disease outbreaks and enhance emergency response capabilities, ultimately protecting and improving public health. The U.S. should be ranked in the top 5 of global health system performance and efficiency rankings by 2030\u2014improving key health outcomes such as life expectancy. Wait times in emergency rooms should be eliminated.</li><li><strong>Smart Infrastructure</strong>: AI-enabled smart cities and smart towns will optimize traffic management, energy consumption, and public transportation systems. This can lead to more sustainable urban environments and improved quality of life for citizens. The U.S. should achieve 30% reductions in average commute times and crime rates while improving citizen satisfaction with government services by 50% within the decade. Imagine if the U.S. eliminated its almost 40,000 annual traffic deaths.</li><li><strong>Defense and National Security</strong>: Develop AI technologies that bolster all forms of national defense and intelligence capabilities. We can set many broad ambitions including: a Golden Dome, autonomous swarm drones, predictive and auto-reactive cyber defenses, adaptive camouflage and stealth, AI-powered real-time intelligence analysis, and AI-enabled military decision support and implementation.</li></ul><p><strong>A Vision for Victory</strong></p><p><strong></strong>The AI race will likely define what it\u2019s like to live in the 21st century. The path forward requires a commitment to bold ambitions and measurable goals that prioritize human dignity, innovation, and freedom. By focusing on outcomes, like getting to the moon, the U.S. will uplift individuals and communities, and create a world where AI amplifies the best of what humanity has to offer. In this race, the true victory will be measured not by the sophistication of our algorithms or the power of our machines but by the impact we have on the lives of people across the globe.</p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

Langley spoke, the U.S. was contemplating a <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/03/03/2025/dismantling-us-africa-command-could-create-a-damaging-power-vacuum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thinning of AFRICOM</a>, following deep <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/africa/africa-usaid-funds.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cuts to USAID</a> programs in the region and a shift to a more transactional commercial relationship with Africa writ large.</p><p>\u201cThe situation [in West Africa] might end up becoming so bad that it will be impossible for the U.S. to ignore,\u201d Jacob Zenn, an Africa expert at the Georgetown Center for Security Studies, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cGeneral Langley was urging everyone to begin paying attention now, or else you're going to have to do it later when the situation is worse.\u201d</p><p>But because JNIM isn\u2019t perceived \u2013 for now \u2013 as a direct threat to the West, and because governments in West Africa are either disinclined or too weak to push back, the group\u2019s influence is spreading.</p><p>JNIM was <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/nctc/terrorist_groups/jnim.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">founded in Mali</a> in 2017 as a coalition of five jihadist groups, including the Sahara branch of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The group\u2019s leader, Iyad Ag Ghali, is a former Toureg separatist leader and Malian diplomat who is reported to have had a \u201cconversion\u201d to radical Islam during a visit to Saudi Arabia two decades ago.</p><p>Ag Ghali was expelled from the Malian government for his links to extremists, and soon after, he united the militant groups under the JNIM umbrella and pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. </p><p>JNIM began to gain momentum by seizing land and bringing terror to Mali, and then to neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso, in a series of ambushes and attacks against government forces, United Nations missions, and civilians.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Lately, JNIM\u2019s strikes have been bolder, including a coordinated attack on Mali\u2019s international airport last September, and an assault earlier this year on a Malian military base in Boulkessi, a border post, that killed at least 60 soldiers and wounded 40 others. Burkina Faso has suffered the worst of the carnage \u2013 JNIM has carried out over 280 attacks in the country in the first half of 2025 alone, double the number from the same time in 2024. Overall, the <a href=\"https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-july-15/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">group has killed</a> more than 1,000 people across the Sahel region since April. </p><p>\u201cEach year we see the lethality of the conflict growing,\u201d Heni Nsaiba, West Africa Senior Analyst at Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cNot just in terms of fatalities\u2026but also in terms of the violence that the group employs to achieve their objectives.\u201d</p><p>Those objectives differ between JNIM\u2019s factions, Nsaiba said, but all share an ambition to impose hardline Islamic rule, and a willingness to use violence to further that goal. </p><p>\u201cSalafi-Jihadist ideology is the foundation of their governance approach,\u201d Levi West, a counterterrorism expert at the Australian National University, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cMuch like HTS in Syria and the Taliban in Afghanistan, this means minority, deeply conservative, and militant interpretations of Islam as the system of governance and the basis of laws.\u201d </p><p>Experts say the group\u2019s hold on territory has <a href=\"https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-july-15/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">roughly tripled</a> in the last three years, to cover areas of Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso that, taken together, are nearly five times the size of Texas. </p><p>\u201cThese are vast areas and include vast desert terrains as well,\u201d Zenn said. \u201cIt's sort of an insurgents\u2019 paradise. If you are able to hide in the desert and store your weapons in hidden places, store your finances in hidden places, [you can] then force the counter insurgents to come into the bush to find you and then ambush them.\u201d</p><p>Poverty and poor governance in the region have helped boost support for JNIM. Experts say a series of coups that brought military juntas to power in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso have only made a bad situation worse, as the juntas have used brute force in ways that have boosted support for JNIM.</p><p>One expert who asked to remain anonymous given security sensitivities in the region said, \u201cthe real problem is that the military juntas in power have decided to double down on some of the heavy-handed tactics that they've used to try to suppress the insurgency.\u201d Those tactics, he told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>, include an \u201cabusive, kick-the-door-down approach\u201d that has driven communities into the hands of the extremists. </p><p>As they capture territory, JNIM\u2019s fighters are piling up war booty along the way. Nsaiba said the group levies zakat or Islamic alms on the populations it controls, runs smuggling and kidnapping operations, and has pillaged state stockpiles of arms and ammunition \u2013 \u201cbasically everything they need to sustain their operations,\u201d Nsaiba said. \u201cAll combined, they have a quite solid war chest.\u201d</p><p>Nsaiba and other experts say JNIM now has the weapons and warfighting capabilities to capture more land \u2013 including cities \u2013 and pose threats to regional governments.</p><p>In his June testimony, <a href=\"https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/35861/africom-commander-highlights-focus-on-counter-terrorism-partner-capacity-building-during-h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gen. Langley warned</a> that the group is spreading to other parts of West Africa, and may threaten the region\u2019s coastline.</p><p>\u201cGen. Langley is right to worry about the spread,\u201d Zenn said, adding that JNIM has made inroads in Benin, Togo, and towards the borders of Cote D\u2019Ivoire, Senegal and Ghana \u2013 coastal nations which have been relatively safe. \u201cThis is the next area of its expansion,\" Zenn said. \u201cAnd unless these countries really develop strong preventative measures at their borders, there's a major risk that JNIM will continue its spread.\u201d </p><p>West African governments have mounted <a href=\"https://www.fpri.org/article/2025/03/counterterrorism-shortcomings-in-mali-burkina-faso-and-niger/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">counterterrorism operations</a> against JNIM. The U.S. has designated Ag Ghali a \u201cSpecially Designated Global Terrorist\u201d and has issued a multi-million dollar bounty and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has called for a regional response. So far, none of it has stopped the terror. </p><p>In fact, the JNIM threat is growing as the U.S. recalibrates its policy toward Africa. A posture that has long included military deployments, diplomatic efforts and USAID programs is now being scaled back, in favor of the U.S. administration\u2019s push to lessen its global military footprint.</p><p>Acknowledging the reduction in U.S. military and development aid to the region, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/west-african-coast-could-boost-revenue-for-jihadists-us-warns?srnd=phx-politics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gen. Langley struck</a> a balance in his testimony between the urgency of the threat and a message that West African nations must carry more of the security burden themselves. While he said the U.S. would continue to offer intelligence-sharing and capacity-building help, <a href=\"https://www.africom.mil/about-the-command/2025-posture-statement-to-congress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he added</a> that \u201cThe plan is theirs\u2026we don\u2019t push ourselves to invade on their sovereignty.\u201d </p><p>And at a May conference with African Defense Chiefs, <a href=\"https://www.sofx.com/africom-commander-warns-of-growing-terror-threat-from-africas-sahel-region/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gen. Langley</a> brought a blunt message. \u201cSome things that we used to do, we may not do anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cwe\u2019re asking you to step up and burden-share with us\u2026Our goal is not to do more for Africa. It\u2019s to help Africa do more for itself.\u201d</p><p>At a recent White House summit, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygqenwx78o\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">President Trump talked</a> about the \u201cincredible commercial opportunities\u201d in the West African countries who were invited to the summit \u2013 Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal \u2013 and asked their leaders to accept migrants deported from the U.S., a pitch that <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> said underscored \u201cthe overlap between the administration\u2019s <a href=\"https://semafor.com/s/iuXVWzRa2G?email=tgnagorski@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">aggressive deportation campaign and its foreign policy</a>.\u201d Not much was said about the terror threat or the recent U.S. aid cuts, which experts have warned will impact stability in Africa.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Sign up now for The Cipher Brief Nightcap newsletter to stay up to speed on the top national security stories of the day and what the experts say about them. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\">Sign up for your afternoon brief today</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Zenn noted that JNIM\u2019s terror, if unchecked, might actually lead to more migrants seeking to come to the U.S. from Africa. \u201cThe ramifications of these capitals in West Africa falling to jihadist groups, let alone these jihadist groups attacking the coastal West African states, as Gen. Langley mentioned, would involve increased migration, human trafficking, drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, and safe havens arriving for the training of other jihadist militants,\u201d he said. \u201cThe geopolitical fallout would end up being significant. </p><p>A core problem in building the case for greater western involvement is that experts doubt JNIM has either the capability or the ambition to strike the West. Zenn says the group has avoided attacks against international targets like hotels, in a calculated effort to avoid drawing in the U.S. or Europe. </p><p>\u201cIt would appear that their primary objective is local, arguably regional, but not global,\u201d West said. \u201cJNIM are detrimental to many things in Mali and the region, but their threat to international security is relatively limited\u2026It would appear that JNIM is really prioritizing the local jihad as their objective.\u201d </p><p>Nsaibia agreed that \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make the case that JNIM is a threat to the U.S. homeland, or even to Europe.\u201d</p><p>Gen. Langley, in his testimony to Congress, said that while JNIM lacked the capability to attack the United States, it might seek to do so in the future. </p><p>\u201cWithout a persistent presence in the Sahel, we are limited in the ability to monitor the expanding influence of terrorist organizations in the region,\u201d he said in his written testimony. Acknowledging the reduction in U.S. military and development aid to the region, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/west-african-coast-could-boost-revenue-for-jihadists-us-warns?srnd=phx-politics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gen. Langley stressed</a> the importance of intelligence sharing and capacity building to help these nations conduct independent operations against militants.</p><p><strong>The China and Russia factors</strong></p><p>The case many experts make for greater U.S. engagement in West Africa is less about a threat to the homeland, and more about a contest for influence with Russia and China.</p><p>Gen. Langley raised the issue in his testimony, noting that China\u2019s military is outspending AFRICOM about 100-to-1 in African countries. Russia is using surrogates like the Wagner Group (now rebranded as \u201cAfrica Corps\u201d) to increase its influence on the continent, and a Kremlin spokesperson said recently that Moscow would seek to boost its security alliances in Africa <a href=\"https://semafor.com/s/8nTWpMbXhi?email=tgnagorski@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">as Western powers retreat</a>. </p><p>\u201cAfrica is a nexus theater for the great-power competition [with China and Russia],\u201d <a href=\"https://www.stripes.com/theaters/africa/2025-06-10/africom-eucom-al-shabab%C2%A0isis-langley-18079031.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gen. Langley said,</a> and Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee that hosted the hearing, echoed the point. \u201cWe need to be putting more resources in AFRICOM to combat what China and Russia are doing,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.stripes.com/theaters/africa/2025-06-10/africom-eucom-al-shabab%C2%A0isis-langley-18079031.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rogers said,</a> \u201crather than looking at taking away attention and resources.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAfrica is a front line in strategic competition,\u201d West told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. He said that while Russia and China \u201care highly active and influential in the region and across Africa,\u201d the U.S. remains largely on the sidelines. </p><p>\u201cOne would hope that the U.S. and its Western allies would take measures to prevent the emergence of a jihadist-dominated area of contingent territory,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever there seem to be limited efforts being made to disrupt this from occurring.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

Given the health risks of sedentary lifestyles, I had tried just about everything to break my lazy rut, and then something worked: watching television.</p><p>Well, OK, not just watching television like a modern Jim Royle, who reached Olympic levels in The Royle Family, but I imposed a rule: if I want to watch TV, I have to do so while sitting on my exercise bike (the one cardio exercise I can tolerate). The result? I\u2019ve been cycling roughly six hours a week for months now. Generally, I watch a lot of sports: if there\u2019s football, rugby, tennis, boxing, NFL or cricket on, I\u2019ll watch it. So invariably through the year I find there\u2019s roughly two hours of sport on three times a week I want to watch.

It\u2019s the final day of Robbins\u2019s first tour, this one to promote her latest book and viral sensation, The Let Them Theory \u2013 her tool for helping people detach from other people\u2019s dramas. Outside forces, she teaches, from annoying relatives to strangers in a traffic jam, are not in your control; nor are you responsible for what they do, feel or think (so&nbsp;long as they are not your children). It\u2019s a waste of time, energy and emotion to even try. Instead, you should just say to yourself: \u201cLet them.\u201d</p><p>Robbins is bounding around, sparkling with charisma and no-nonsense charm, first in a comfy tracksuit (available from her website for \u00a3150), then in boss-lady blazer and sexy denim. For nearly two hours, she commands the stage \u2013 occasionally joined by her two grown-up daughters, one of whom, Sawyer, is the book\u2019s co-author \u2013 and the women in the audience smile, nod, hug each other and cry. By the finale, when the confetti cannons go off and yellow ribbons rain down to Coldplay\u2019s booming A Sky Full of Stars, I have promised myself I will (in no particular order) lose my perimenopause tummy, be nicer to my children and care less what other people think. I am, I decide, beaming to myself, ready to change the trajectory of my life.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/19/mel-robbins-self-help-superstar-success-survival-silencing-critics\">Continue reading...</a>",

The arrangement, which was critical to Microsoft winning the federal government\u2019s cloud computing business a decade ago, relies on U.S. citizens with security clearances to oversee the work and serve as a barrier against espionage and sabotage.</p>\n\n<p>But these workers, known as \u201cdigital escorts,\u201d often lack the technical expertise to police the work of foreign engineers with far more advanced skills, ProPublica found.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier Friday, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence, cited ProPublica in a letter to Hegseth asking for details about which DOD contractors use Chinese personnel to maintain the department\u2019s information and computing systems.</p>\n\n<p>China poses \u201cone of the most aggressive and dangerous threats to the United States, as evidenced by its infiltrations of our critical infrastructure, telecommunications networks and supply chains,\u201d Cotton <a href=\"https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1946196464981459316\">wrote in the letter</a>, which he posted on X. \u201cDOD must guard against all potential threats within its supply chain, including those from subcontractors.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Since 2011, cloud computing companies like Microsoft that wanted to sell their services to the U.S. government had to establish how they would ensure that personnel working with federal data would have the requisite \u201caccess authorizations\u201d and background screenings. Additionally, the Defense Department requires that people handling sensitive data be U.S. citizens or permanent residents.</p>\n\n<p>This presented an issue for Microsoft, which relies on a vast global workforce with significant operations in India, China and the European Union.</p>\n\n<p>So the tech giant enlisted staffing companies to hire U.S.-based digital escorts, who had security clearances that authorized them to access sensitive information, to take direction from the overseas experts. An engineer might briefly describe the job to be completed \u2014 for instance, updating a firewall, installing an update to fix a bug or reviewing logs to troubleshoot a problem. Then, with little review, an escort would copy and paste the engineer\u2019s commands into the federal cloud.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trusting that what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t malicious, but we really can\u2019t tell,\u201d one escort told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>In an earlier statement in response to ProPublica\u2019s investigation, Microsoft said that its personnel and contractors operate in a manner \u201cconsistent with US Government requirements and processes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The company\u2019s global workers \u201chave no direct access to customer data or customer systems,\u201d the statement said. Escorts \u201cwith the appropriate clearances and training provide direct support. These personnel are provided specific training on protecting sensitive data, preventing harm, and use of the specific commands/controls within the environment.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Microsoft said it has an internal review process known as \u201cLockbox\u201d to \u201cmake sure the request is deemed safe or has any cause for concern.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Insight Global \u2014 a contractor that provides digital escorts to Microsoft \u2014 said it \u201cevaluates the technical capabilities of each resource throughout the interview process to ensure they possess the technical skills required\u201d for the job and provides training.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/doris-burke\">Doris Burke</a> contributed research.</p>",

HUD has been pursuing these cases \u2014 which range from instances where the agency has issued a formal charge of discrimination to newer investigations \u2014 for as many as seven years. In three of them, HUD officials had determined that the defendants had violated the Fair Housing Act or related civil rights laws. A HUD staffer familiar with the other four investigations believes civil rights violations occurred in each, the official told ProPublica. Under President Donald Trump, the agency now plans to abruptly end all of them, regardless of prior findings of wrongdoing.</p>\n\n<p>Four HUD officials said they could recall no precedent for the plan, which they said signals an acceleration of the administration\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-hud-weakening-enforcement-fair-housing-laws\">retreat from fair housing</a> enforcement. \u201cNo administration previously has so aggressively rolled back the basic protections that help people who are being harmed in their community,\u201d one of the officials said. \u201cThe civil rights protections that HUD enforces are intended to protect the most vulnerable people in society.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In the short term, closing the cases would allow the local governments in question to continue allegedly mistreating minority communities, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. In the long term, they said, it could embolden local politicians and developers elsewhere to take actions that entrench segregation, without fear of punishment from the federal government.</p>\n\n<p>HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett declined to answer questions, saying \u201cHUD does not comment on active Fair Housing matters or individual personnel.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Three of the cases involve accusations that local governments clustered polluting industrial facilities in minority neighborhoods. </p>\n\n<p>One concerned a protracted <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/13052023/chicago-hud-settle-environmental-racism-case-as-lori-lightfoot-leaves-office/\">dispute over a scrap metal shredding plant</a> in Chicago. The facility had operated for years in the largely white neighborhood of Lincoln Park. But residents complained ceaselessly of the fumes, debris, noise and, occasionally, smoke emanating from the plant. So the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250114225712/https:/www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Main/documents/Letter_of_Finding_05-20-0419_City_of_Chicago.pdf\">city allegedly pressured</a> the recycling company to close the old facility and open a new one in a minority neighborhood in southeast Chicago. In 2022, HUD found that \u201crelocating the Facility to the Southeast Site will bring environmental benefits to a neighborhood that is 80% White and environmental harms to a neighborhood that is 83% Black and Hispanic.\u201d Chicago\u2019s mayor called <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/7/22/23274612/lori-lightfoot-showdown-hud-housing-urban-development-federal-funding-homelessness-aids\">allegations of discrimination \u201cpreposterous,\u201d</a> then <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/5/12/23720343/hud-environmental-racism-lightfoot-general-iron-environmental-justice-housing-urban-development\">settled the case and agreed to reforms</a> in 2023. (The new plant has not opened; its owner <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/environment/2025/02/21/general-iron-lawsuit-seeks-millions-chicago-permit-denial-brandon-johnson-pollution\">has sued</a> the city.)</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.nhlp.org/wp-content/uploads/Flint-HUD-complaint-2021.pdf\">another case</a>, a predominantly white Michigan township <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/in-depth/news/local/michigan/2021/12/30/michigan-environmental-justice-pollution-permitting-egle-epa/8888962002/\">allowed an asphalt plant</a> to open on its outskirts, away from its population centers but near subsidized housing complexes in the neighboring poor, mostly Black city of Flint. The township did not respond to a ProPublica inquiry about the case.</p>\n\n<p>Still another case involved <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.caller.com/story/news/local/2025/03/27/city-of-corpus-christi-granted-third-major-permit-for-desalination-plant-inner-harbor/82687294007/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiW7cfS5cKOAxWav4kEHc-aLgYQFnoECBkQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1qBpH2yi4PXZI1SkDjRO61\">a plan pushed</a> by the city of Corpus Christi, Texas, to build a water desalination plant in a historically Black neighborhood already fringed by oil refineries and other industrial facilities. (Rates of cancer and birth defects in the area are disproportionately high, and average life expectancy is 15 years lower than elsewhere in the city, <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/inner_harbor_title_vi_complaint_oct26_final.pdf\">researchers found</a>.) The city denied the allegations. Construction of the plant is expected to conclude in 2028.</p>\n\n<p>Three other cases involve allegations of discrimination in municipal land use decisions. In Memphis, Tennessee, the city and its utility <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250225120632/https:/www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/FHEO/documents/City-of-Memphis-Charge-Redacted.pdf\">allegedly coerced residents</a> of a poor Black neighborhood to sell their homes so that it could build a new facility there. In Cincinnati, the city has <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24487946-hud-complaint-v-cincinnati-2024/?responsive=1&amp;responsive=false&amp;sidebar=false&amp;title=1%3Fembed=true\">allegedly concentrated</a> low-income housing in poor Black neighborhoods and kept it out of white neighborhoods. And in Chicago, the city has given local politicians <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/07/08/hud-affordable-housing-aldermanic-prerogative-discrimination-brandon-johnson\">veto power</a> over development proposals in their districts, resulting in little new affordable housing in white neighborhoods. (Memphis, its utility and Chicago have disputed the allegations; Cincinnati declined to comment on them.)</p>\n\n<p>The last case involved a Texas state agency allegedly <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-hud-texas-housing-discrimination-cases-dallas-houston\">diverting $1 billion</a> in disaster mitigation money away from Houston and other communities of color hit hard by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and toward more rural, white communities less damaged by the storm. The agency has disputed the allegations.</p>\n\n<p>All of the investigations and cases are now slated to be closed. HUD is also planning to stop enforcing the settlement it reached in the Chicago recycling case, the records show.</p>\n\n<p>The move to drop the cases is being directed by Brian Hawkins, a recent Trump administration hire at HUD who serves as a senior adviser in the Fair Housing Office, two agency officials said. Hawkins has no law degree or prior experience in housing, according to his LinkedIn profile. But this month, he circulated a list within HUD of the seven cases that indicated the agency\u2019s plans for them. In the cases that involve Cincinnati, Corpus Christi, Flint and Houston, the agency would \u201cfind no cause on [the] merits,\u201d the list reads. In the two Chicago cases and the one involving Memphis, HUD would rescind letters documenting the agency\u2019s prior findings. Hawkins did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>The list does not offer a legal justification for dropping the cases. But Hawkins also circulated a memo that indicates the reasoning behind dropping one \u2014 the Chicago recycling case. The memo cites an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-equality-of-opportunity-and-meritocracy/\">executive order</a> issued by Trump in April eliminating federal enforcement of \u201cdisparate-impact liability,\u201d the doctrine that seemingly neutral policies or practices could have a discriminatory effect. Hawkins\u2019 memo stated that \u201cthe Department will not interpret environmental impacts as violations of fair housing law absent a showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d Four HUD officials said such a position would be a stark departure from prior department policy and relevant case law.</p>\n\n<p>The reversal on the Chicago recycling case also follows behind-the-scenes pressure on HUD from Sen. Jim Banks. In June, Banks, a Republican from Indiana, wrote a letter to HUD Secretary Scott Turner and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin in which he criticized the administration of President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the case as \u201cbrazen overreach.\u201d Noting that the Chicago plant would supply metal to Indiana steel mills, Banks asked the Trump appointees to \u201ctake any actions you deem necessary to remedy the situation.\u201d Banks did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>That case and others among the seven had also received scrutiny from other federal and state agencies, including the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice. The EPA declined to say whether it was still pursuing any of the cases. The DOJ did not respond to the same inquiry.</p>\n\n<p>The case closures at HUD would be the latest stage in a broad rollback of fair housing enforcement under the Trump administration, which <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-hud-weakening-enforcement-fair-housing-laws\">ProPublica reported on previously</a>. That rollback has continued in other ways as well. The agency recently initiated a plan to transfer more than half of its fair housing attorneys in the office of general counsel into unrelated roles, compounding prior staff losses since the beginning of the year, four HUD officials told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>The officials fear long-lasting ramifications from the changes. \u201cFair housing laws shape our cities, shape where housing gets built, where pollution occurs, where disaster money goes,\u201d one official said. \u201cWithout them, we have a different country.\u201d</p>",

I am not a criminal.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration had sent dozens of Venezuelan immigrants to Guantanamo. He was afraid the same would happen to him.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cJust in case something happens to me, so you can be aware.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Uncertain about his fate, Ramos wanted to make sure there was a record of what happened to him.</p>\n\n<p>A month later, he was gone.</p>\n\n<p>Ramos never set foot in the U.S. \u2014 at least not as a free man. He left Venezuela in January 2024, hoping to earn enough money to pay for his newborn son\u2019s medical needs. Born with a respiratory condition, the family\u2019s \u201cmilagrito,\u201d or \u201clittle miracle,\u201d had severe asthma and repeatedly needed to be hospitalized. The cost of treatment had become impossible to manage on the meager wages Ramos made washing cars in Venezuela\u2019s collapsed economy, so he trekked thousands of miles through a half dozen countries to reach the U.S. border.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>When Ramos arrived, he didn\u2019t sneak into the country. He followed the rules established by the Biden administration for immigrants seeking asylum. He signed up for an appointment through a government app and, when he was granted one, turned himself in to request protection. An immigration official and a judge determined he didn\u2019t qualify, and Ramos didn\u2019t fight the decision.</p>\n\n<p>The government kept him in detention until he could be deported back to Venezuela. </p>\n\n<p>In the months that followed, Donald Trump was elected president for a second term and began his mass deportation campaign. Among his first actions was to fly groups of Venezuelan immigrants whom he had labeled dangerous gang members to a U.S. military base at <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-administration-migrants-guantanamo-bay\">Guantanamo Bay, Cuba</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Ramos, 30, panicked and called his wife to say he was worried that the same was going to happen to him. On a video call his wife recorded, he held up a document he said was proof that immigration authorities had agreed to deport him to Venezuela. But he worried that they would not honor that promise.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cI have a family,\u201d he said, staring directly into the camera. \u201cI am simply a hard-working Venezuelan. I haven\u2019t committed any crimes. I don\u2019t have a criminal record in my country nor anywhere else.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A month later, a more upbeat Ramos called again. He seemed confident that U.S. officials would send him home. Ramos\u2019 family started preparing for his return. They planned to bake him a cake, cook his favorite chicken dish and go to church together to thank God for bringing him home safely.</p>\n\n<p>They never heard from him again.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n\n                            \n                                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n\n            First image: Bastidas rests with Ramos\u2019 son and her grandson, Jared, at their home in Venezuela.

Without publicly providing evidence, the administration accused each of them of being members of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan prison gang it designated a terrorist organization.</p>\n\n<p>In the months since the mass deportation \u2014 one of the most consequential in recent history \u2014 the Trump administration has released almost no details about the backgrounds of the people it deported, calling them \u201cmonsters,\u201d \u201csick criminals\u201d and the \u201cworst of the worst.\u201d Several news organizations have reported that most of the men did not have criminal records. ProPublica, The Texas Tribune and a team of Venezuelan journalists from Alianza Rebelde Investiga (Rebel Alliance Investigates) and Cazadores de Fake News (Fake News Hunters) went further, finding that the government\u2019s own records showed that it <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-el-salvador-deportees-criminal-convictions-cecot-venezuela\">knew the vast majority of the men</a> had not been convicted of violent crimes in the U.S. We also searched records in South America and found that only a few had committed violent crimes abroad.</p>\n\n<p>Now, a case-by-case examination of each of the deportees, along with interviews with their lawyers and family members, reveals another jarring reality: Most of the men were not hiding from federal authorities but were instead moving through the nation\u2019s immigration system. They were either in the middle of their cases, which normally should have protected them from deportation, or they had already been ordered deported and should have first been given the option to be sent back to a country they chose.</p>\n\n<p>Like Ramos, more than 50 of the men had used the government app called CBP One to make an appointment with border officials to try to enter the country. Others had crossed illegally and then surrendered to border agents, often the first step in seeking asylum in immigration court. </p>\n\n<p>According to our analysis, almost half of the men were deported even though their cases hadn\u2019t been decided yet. More than 60 of them had pending asylum claims, including several who were only days away from a hearing where a judge could have ruled on whether they would be allowed to stay. Judges or federal officials had issued deportation orders for about 100 of the men, and a handful had even agreed to pay their own way home. Others, like Ramos, had spent their entire time in the U.S. in detention. They had no opportunity to commit crimes in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, many of those who were allowed into the country had been appearing at their court hearings and immigration check-ins. At least nine had been granted temporary protected status, which gives people from countries affected by disasters or other extraordinary conditions permission to live and work in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>By and large, these were men who had been playing by the rules of the country\u2019s immigration system.</p>\n\n<p>Then, the Trump administration changed the rules.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n                                \n            \n        \n\n    \n\n            Rodr\u00edguez reviews the video she recorded of her husband before he was sent to CECOT, a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.\n    \n            (Alejandro Bonilla Su\u00e1rez for ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>A day before the administration deported the men to El Salvador, Trump invoked an obscure 18th-century law called the Alien Enemies Act and declared that Tren de Aragua was invading the country. Administration officials argued that the declaration authorized them to take extraordinary measures to remove anyone it had determined was a member of the gang and to make sure they would not threaten the U.S. again.</p>\n\n<p>Following the March 15 deportations, the Trump administration moved to shut down their pending immigration cases. Since then, more than 95 cases have been dismissed, terminated or otherwise closed by judges, according to our analysis. They disappear from the dockets, some marked as dismissed just hours before a scheduled hearing. </p>\n\n<p>Michelle Bran\u00e9, who served as a senior Department of Homeland Security official in the Biden administration, said it was \u201cvery un-American\u201d to deport people who followed the immigration rules at the time. \u201cYou can\u2019t retroactively say that those people were acting illegally and now punish them for that,\u201d she added. </p>\n\n<p>Lawyers for the Venezuelan men have filed several lawsuits against the administration, calling the summary removals from the country a gross violation of their clients\u2019 rights. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled in June that the move deprived the men of their constitutional rights and called their plight <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436.148.0_1.pdf\">Kafkaesque</a>. He wrote that the men \u201cnever had any opportunity to challenge the Government\u2019s say-so,\u201d and that they \u201clanguish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The government has appealed the ruling.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Ramos\u2019 mother, Cris\u00e1lida del Carmen Bastidas de Ramos, waits anxiously for any news about her oldest child. \u201cWhat is my son thinking? Is my son eating well? Is my son sleeping? Is he cold?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIs he alive?\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Rodr\u00edguez plays with her son at their home in Venezuela.\n    \n            (Adriana Loureiro Fern\u00e1ndez for ProPublica and The Texas Tribune)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Although the Trump administration routinely describes the men as criminals and terrorists, it has not provided evidence to support the claim. Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at DHS, defended sending them to the Salvadoran prison. \u201cThey may not have criminal records in the U.S., beyond breaking our laws to enter the country illegally,\u201d she said in a statement, \u201cbut many of these illegal aliens are far from innocent.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>For example, she said one of the TPS holders sent to El Salvador admitted he had previously been convicted of murder. We obtained Venezuelan court records confirming that the man had been convicted of murder and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. McLaughlin said his case proved that immigrants had been granted status in the U.S. under Biden without being thoroughly vetted. Three former DHS officials from the Biden administration said the vetting process has remained standard across administrations, including during the first Trump term, and that many governments do not share criminal background histories with U.S. officials.</p>\n\n<p>Trump has moved to strip TPS protections from hundreds of thousands of people.</p>\n\n<p>Ramos, McLaughlin said, was a terrorist who was flagged as a Tren de Aragua member in a law enforcement database at his CBP One appointment. His family denies he has anything to do with the gang. His lawyers said in court records that U.S. authorities wrongly identified him as a gang member based on his tattoos and an \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d report from Panamanian officials. A spokesperson for the Panamanian security ministry said he could not locate any documents about Ramos.</p>\n\n<p>At least 163 men who were deported had tattoos, we found. Law enforcement officials in the U.S., Colombia, Chile and Venezuela with expertise in the Tren de Aragua told us that tattoos are not an indicator of gang membership.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Albert Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez Parra had applied for asylum and worked at Chicago\u2019s Wrigley Field before he was detained in November. He was deported to El Salvador in March, where he remains imprisoned.\n    \n            (Courtesy of the Cook County public defender\u2019s office in Chicago)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Days before Albert Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez Parra was whisked away, he appeared in immigration court and tried to convince a judge that his tattoos did not mean he was part of the gang.</p>\n\n<p>He had come to the U.S. with a brother in 2023, applied for asylum and settled in Chicago. He told his mother that it was difficult to find work, but that he\u2019d gotten an electric razor, learned to cut hair and offered trims on the street. In January 2024, he was arrested at a Walmart in the Chicago suburbs for shoplifting about $1,000 worth of food, laundry detergent, shampoo and other items. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, served a two-day jail sentence and tried to move on. </p>\n\n<p>Rodr\u00edguez Parra, 28, got a job working in concessions at Wrigley Field, moved in with his girlfriend and sent money home to his mother to buy a refrigerator and a stove. Then, in November, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents picked him up at his apartment. McLaughlin said he was in the country illegally and was a Tren de Aragua member. Rodr\u00edguez Parra continued his asylum case from immigration detention in Indiana. </p>\n\n<p>He told his family he believed he would be released soon. But in early March, he was transferred to a jail in Missouri, then to one in Central Texas, then another in Laredo, in South Texas, each move bringing him closer to the border. Uncertainty began creeping into his calls home.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the transfers, Rodr\u00edguez Parra\u2019s attorney, Cruz Rodriguez, who works for a small immigration unit at the Cook County public defender\u2019s office in Chicago, said he was confident in the merits of the asylum case. He felt optimistic when he logged into his client\u2019s virtual bond hearing before Judge Eva Saltzman on March 10.  </p>\n\n<p>At the hearing, a government attorney asked Rodr\u00edguez Parra about a TikTok video he\u2019d made of himself dancing to a popular audio clip of someone shouting, \u201cTe va agarrar el Tren de Aragua,\u201d which means, \u201cThe Tren de Aragua is going to get you.\u201d Close to 60,000 users on TikTok have shared the clip. </p>\n\n<p>Rodr\u00edguez Parra scoffed at the notion that a real gang member would make such a video. \u201cIt would be like they were outing themselves,\u201d he said in Spanish. The audio clip has been used by Venezuelans to ridicule the widespread suggestion that everyone from the country is a gangster.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n    \n        <p>\n            <strong><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/help-propublica-report-venezuelans-deported-cecot\">Do You Have Information About the CECOT Deportations? Help ProPublica Report.</a></strong>\n        </p>\n\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The government attorney also asked Rodr\u00edguez Parra about the tattoos that covered his neck, arms and chest \u2014 a rose, a wolf, carnival masks and an angel holding a gun. \u201cIn my country, it\u2019s very normal to have tattoos,\u201d he responded. \u201cEach one represents a story about my life.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He was also questioned about a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member who had crossed the border at the same time as him. Rodr\u00edguez Parra said he did not know the man.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the hearing, he pleaded with the judge to free him on bond. \u201cI\u2019m a good person,\u201d he told her. \u201cIf I was in a gang, I wouldn\u2019t have applied for asylum. I came fleeing my country.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Saltzman denied Rodr\u00edguez Parra\u2019s request, citing his shoplifting conviction. But she offered him a sliver of hope, reminding him that his final hearing was just 10 days away. If she granted him asylum, he\u2019d be released and could continue his life in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not facing a particularly lengthy detention without a bond,\u201d she told him.</p>\n\n<p>Five days later, he was gone. At what was supposed to be his final asylum hearing on March 20, Rodr\u00edguez Parra\u2019s lawyer sounded despondent. He had barely slept. He didn\u2019t know where the authorities had taken his client, but he\u2019d seen a video posted online of shackled men being frog-marched into CECOT. The attorney had visited El Salvador and was aware of that country\u2019s reputation for mistreating prisoners. He feared his client would face a similar fate.</p>\n\n<p>He felt powerless. At the hearing, he turned to the government lawyer on the call. \u201cFor his family\u2019s sake,\u201d he told her, \u201cwould you happen to know what country he was sent to?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The government\u2019s lawyer had little to say.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m operating under the same information as you,\u201d she responded. \u201cI have no further information to provide.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><strong>Update, July 18, 2025:</strong> More than 230 men the Trump administration sent to a prison in El Salvador were returned to Venezuela on Friday in a prisoner swap. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted on X that he had handed over all of the men. In exchange, he said, a \u201cconsiderable number of Venezuelan political prisoners\u201d and Americans held by Venezuela were freed. The Trump administration had accused the men of being members of a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also confirmed the exchange.</p>\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Design and development by <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/anna-donlan\">Anna Donlan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/allen-tan\">Allen Tan</a> of ProPublica. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/Agnel-Philip\">Agnel Philip</a> of ProPublica contributed data reporting. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/gabriel-sandoval\">Gabriel Sandoval</a> of ProPublica contributed research.

Jill had been told for years that she didn\u2019t have either of these, never mind both.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>After my first book, \u201cThe Sports Gene,\u201d came out in 2013, I was on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d talking about genetics, and Jill happened to be within earshot of her TV. \u201cI thought, oh, this is divine providence,\u201d Jill later told me. So she sent me that email with the provocative subject line. She followed up by sending me a batch of family photos and a bound packet outlining her theory: that she and Canadian sprinter Priscilla Lopes-Schliep \u2014 bronze medalist in the 100-meter hurdles at the 2008 Olympics \u2014 shared a genetic mutation.</p>\n\n<p>On the face of it, this seemed ridiculous. One could hardly find a picture of two more different women. Take a look at this page from the packet Jill sent me:</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The packet outlined in granular detail why Jill thought, just from looking at pictures of Priscilla, that the two women shared a genetic mutation that caused the same fat wasting, but because Priscilla didn\u2019t also have muscle wasting \u2014 quite the contrary \u2014 her body had found some way to \u201cgo around\u201d muscular dystrophy.</p>\n\n<p>If Jill was right, she thought, perhaps scientists could study both of them and figure out how to help people with muscles like Jill\u2019s develop muscles a little closer to Priscilla\u2019s end of the human physique spectrum. Jill was sharing all this with me because she wasn\u2019t sure how best to contact Priscilla and hoped I would facilitate an introduction.</p>\n\n<p>Jill\u2019s hypothesis struck me as unlikely, to say the least. But her presentation in the packet was so interesting, and her knowledge of the underlying genetics and physiology so thorough, that I felt her idea deserved a hearing. I reached out to Priscilla; she agreed to meet Jill, and after comparing body parts in a hotel lobby, Jill convinced her to get a genetic test. Long story short, Jill turned out to be right. She and Priscilla had a mutation in the same gene, albeit at neighboring locations.</p>\n\n<p>The discovery led Priscilla to get urgent care for a serious health condition that had previously been overlooked because of her obvious fitness. Jill and I shared this story in an <a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/577/something-only-i-can-see\">episode of \u201cThis American Life\u201d in 2016</a> \u2014 which was rerun last week in her honor.</p>\n\n<p>After that story ran, Jill\u2019s genome became the subject of research, exactly as she\u2019d hoped. Today, in a lab in Iowa, there are fruit flies known as \u201cJill\u201d flies, because they have been engineered to carry her same mutation. As expected, Jill flies have severely limited mobility. But just recently, a scientist conducted a genetic experiment in which she increased the production of a particular protein in the Jill flies. Suddenly, they began to move like normal fruit flies.</p>\n\n\n<p>The breadth of life contained in <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/manufacturing-my-miracle-9781538197226/\">Jill\u2019s new book</a> is incredible.</p>\n\n<p>She was a child the first time she heard a doctor discussing her own death with her mother. The indignities of adolescence and young adulthood that she endured were legion, starting with spontaneous falls in school, followed by kids looping their fingers around her arms and legs and asking if her mother fed her.</p>\n\n<p>Jill\u2019s condition accelerated with puberty, so the bodily changes that are confusing for any teenager were absolutely harrowing for her. Almost overnight she lost the ability to do things she loved, like skate or ride a bike.</p>\n\n<p>At one point in her early teen years, a doctor ordered pictures of Jill\u2019s posture, which forced her into a strange and humiliating photo session that hadn\u2019t been properly explained beforehand:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI had seen these photos before \u2014 a stark, frozen moment of a patient\u2019s greatest vulnerability, the body positioned in a way nature and the photographer dictate, all except for the eyes. The eyes cannot be manipulated or coaxed. It is often said that the eyes are the windows to the soul. Maybe that is why black bars are printed over the eyes of the patient. Perhaps this is done to protect the patient\u2019s anonymity, but I wonder if it isn\u2019t really done to shield the peering eyes of the medical community from the humanity before them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In college, when Jill rushed a sorority, she couldn\u2019t keep up with fellow pledges as they walked across campus. When a man who had been following the group saw Jill lag behind, he crept up and exposed himself to her. \u201cI had been targeted because I was weak,\u201d Jill writes. \u201cI had assumed the plight of the injured gazelle, the one separated from the herd with a lame leg. \u2026 Any normal eighteen-year-old would bolt for safety, but I remained glued in place, the shame of my predicament filling every cell of my being. I was trapped alongside a simple street curb, something I couldn\u2019t climb, no matter my desperate need to get away.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But even more powerful in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/manufacturing-my-miracle-9781538197226/\">Manufacturing My Miracle</a>\u201d than the candid humiliations are the scenes of family, love and hope.</p>\n\n<p>Jill\u2019s wry humor comes through when she writes about dating. At one point she used a Match.com profile to come up with the estimate that at least 1% of men are open to dating a woman with a disability. In typical Jill fashion, rather than lamenting the other 99%, she was thrilled that this meant that if she got her profile in front of enough men, she could have a new date every week of the year.</p>\n\n<p>Jill eventually met Jeremy, the man she would marry. She writes about aspects of their relationship with such tenderness that I frequently paused after a passage just to sit and think about her words for a few moments. \u201cI recalled our first weeks of dating when Jeremy made a heartfelt observation,\u201d Jill writes. \u201cPreviously, as a single man, he often went an entire weekend without saying even one word aloud. It was such a contrast to the way I lived my life. I was known to strike up a conversation with the caller of a misdialed number, banter with strangers in a bookstore, or chat freely with the checkout clerk at the grocery store.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In their second month of dating, Jill and Jeremy attended the gigantic Iowa State Fair. Here\u2019s how Jill remembered it:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI lived ten years in a single night, clutching carnival booty tightly to my chest as Jeremy walked up and down the rows of carnival games, taking entirely too long to decide which to go for. \u2018What\u2019s taking you so long?\u2019 I asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m trying to find one you can play,\u2019 he said.</p>\n\n<p>My eyes filled with tears.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<p>After our \u201cThis American Life\u201d segment came out in 2016, Jill became a bit of a celebrity among people struggling to figure out their own mysterious illnesses.</p>\n\n<p>She developed into a sort of clearinghouse for people with undiagnosed muscle conditions seeking help. She kept in constant touch with a man in rural Pakistan who sent her a video of his struggle to rise from his knees following daily prayers at a local mosque. She navigated immense cultural and logistical barriers to help him get a genetic test. \u201cShe was a worldwide person,\u201d her mother, Mary, told me recently, \u201cjust out of her little office in Gowrie, Iowa.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Jill became so fluent in genetics that she was perceived as a scientist when she called labs, lab supply companies or pharmaceutical companies. Toward the end of her life, that fluency allowed her to obtain an experimental gene therapy that isn\u2019t actually available for nonresearch purposes. She knew the drug was both promising and potentially deadly, and with a loving husband and college student son in mind, she was hesitant. \u201cI no longer had a fear of death,\u201d Jill writes in <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/manufacturing-my-miracle-9781538197226/\">her book</a>, \u201cbut this did not imply that I wanted to die. My wish was the opposite, but without a life partner and a child, I wouldn\u2019t need to consider anyone\u2019s viewpoint but my own.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As always, she did consider others, and at the time of her death she had not gone through with this final experiment.</p>\n\n<p>In April, Jill and Jeremy drove to Chicago to attend a wedding. Mary shared photos with me, and it\u2019s the same Jill I began talking to in 2013: dressed impeccably, every strand of blond hair in its right place. She took great care and pride in her appearance. Looking at the pictures, it is extremely hard to imagine that Jill was less than two months away from dying.</p>\n\n<p>Her brother Aaron, afflicted with the same condition, had passed away in 2019. Four of the five siblings inherited the mutation, though the disease severity differed \u2014 likely moderated by other parts of the genome. In \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/manufacturing-my-miracle-9781538197226/\">Manufacturing My Miracle</a>,\u201d Jill writes of the difficult decision regarding whether or not to have a child, given the 50-50 chance of passing down her mutation. Her son, Martin, did not inherit the mutation.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly before the \u201cThis American Life\u201d episode ran, Jill got nervous and wondered if we should hit pause on it. She worried that listeners would only focus on her decision to have a child and criticize her for being selfish. We talked for hours about the potential outcomes. Jill and I had been in touch for three years by that time, and we were going to stick together as friends no matter what criticism came. She decided we should forge ahead. Fortunately, the response was the most overwhelmingly positive of any story I\u2019ve ever been involved with.</p>\n\n<p>Jill and I met up in Chicago after that so I could watch her give an invited lecture. We kept in touch over the years. Sometimes we went months without talking before a burst of calls back and forth.</p>\n\n<p>By this spring, it had been an unusually long while since we last talked. We emailed, but no phone calls. Mary told me that Jill had recently bought a new dress that she planned to wear when giving talks about <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/manufacturing-my-miracle-9781538197226/\">her book</a>. At a visitation before the funeral, she\u2019ll be wearing her book dress.</p>\n\n<p>Mary added that, a few weeks before Jill passed, she caught pneumonia and never recovered. Mary told me her voice was weak. \u201cI kept telling her to call you,\u201d Mary said. \u201cBut she kept saying: \u2018I want my voice to be stronger. I want my voice to be stronger before I call David.\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m crestfallen that I didn\u2019t hear from her again, but I think her voice was plenty strong.</p>",

The owner had purchased it in 2006 through a federal mortgage program designed specifically for people like her: impoverished, first-time homeowners who live in the most rural parts of the United States. The loan, which came directly from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, required no down payment. </p>\n\n<p>But things started going wrong from the day she moved in. First, the basement flooded. Then the furnace stopped working. As major repair costs accumulated over the next six years, the woman\u2019s health deteriorated until she was forced to leave her job as a manager at Kmart. Her disability check was not enough to cover medical expenses and the upkeep required for the house \u2014 let alone the $855 monthly mortgage. </p>\n\n<p>So in 2012 she drove to a USDA office 20 miles away and tried to give the house back. She said staff there would not accept her keys, telling her instead to call a toll-free number for help, as agency protocol requires. She left a message and did not hear back. She stopped paying her mortgage and moved out. </p>\n\n<p>Her dream home sat abandoned for more than a decade.    </p>\n\n<p>USDA guidance says the <a href=\"https://www.rd.usda.gov/media/file/download/hb-1-3550-consolidated.pdf\">agency should act quickly</a> when borrowers fall behind on payments \u201cto minimize any potential loss to the Government and to the borrower.\u201d A prompt sale keeps the government from having to pay the legal and administrative costs associated with foreclosure down the road and may protect the borrower from incurring a major blemish on their credit history.</p>\n\n<p>But that did not happen. Rather, 13 years passed before a sheriff\u2019s deputy knocked on the door of the woman\u2019s public housing apartment in May and served her with foreclosure papers on the now dilapidated ranch home that\u2019s been overtaken by squatters. The government\u2019s delay hurt the value of its investment and left the woman with a bill far greater than the cost of the loan she initially took out \u2014 with additional interest and other fees that had accumulated over those years.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The woman, now 68, declined to be interviewed, but her attorney, Tom Cox, said she allowed him to share her experience on the condition that she not be named to protect her privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Since March, the USDA has filed 56 foreclosures in the federal court system against properties purchased with a rural development mortgage, also known as a Section 502 direct loan. All but one were in Maine. The borrowers have been in default for an average of nearly nine years. </p>\n\n<p>As in the case of the Caribou homeowner, the USDA\u2019s delays in those cases have resulted in borrowers racking up more debt because of the interest and fees that piled up in the intervening years, according to a Bangor Daily News and ProPublica examination of the foreclosure cases and interviews with former USDA officials and legal experts. </p>\n\n<p>On average, borrowers in the 55 Maine cases owe $110,000 more than they would have had the agency moved to take possession of the properties when they first defaulted, the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica found. This includes what the USDA calls <a href=\"https://www.rd.usda.gov/media/file/download/maximum-property-preservation-allowances.pdf\">\u201cpreservation and inspection\u201d fees</a>, a broad category on the foreclosure filings that can include home repairs and yard maintenance, among other things.  </p>\n\n<p>Borrowers who can\u2019t pay risk having the government <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/17/2020-09447/debt-management#:~:text=If%20a%20USDA%20agency%20determines,in%20operations%20of%20USDA%20agencies\">garnish their wages or federal benefits</a> such as Social Security. The Caribou woman had her disability checks garnished six times since 2015 to offset her debt before the USDA even foreclosed on her property, according to her lawyer. The best way to keep the government from garnishing federal benefits is to file for bankruptcy, attorneys said.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt really undermines the concept of giving access to homeownership to a population who might not otherwise have been able to afford it,\u201d said Rhiannon Hampson, former USDA rural development director for Maine who stepped down in January before President Donald Trump was inaugurated. \u201cThe irony, with all of these fees piled on, is that they can\u2019t afford to get out of it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The recent wave of foreclosure filings in Maine underscores the government\u2019s failure to monitor a mortgage program that since its founding in 1949 has poured tens of billions of tax dollars into giving the poorest Americans a shot at homeownership.</p>\n\n<p>The USDA does not publicly report how often it files foreclosures. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Maine Democrat and member of a House appropriations subcommittee overseeing the USDA\u2019s direct loan program, has proposed language in the House agriculture appropriations report for the 2026 fiscal year calling on the agency to regularly report the number of foreclosures and abandoned properties related to the direct loan program. The bill awaits a vote before the full House of Representatives.</p>\n\n<p>The USDA regularly filed foreclosures in Maine prior to the coronavirus pandemic but has rarely done so in recent years, according to Richard H. Broderick Jr., a Maine attorney with whom the agency had contracted to file foreclosures until 2022. Kevin Crosman, the Maine attorney now filing foreclosures on behalf of the USDA, would not comment on why the agency started doing so again.</p>\n\n<p>Reporters visited 12 of the 55 homes in the Bangor Daily News\u2019 core coverage area in May. At least five appeared to be abandoned and in disrepair \u2014 with windows boarded up or a sign affixed to the door saying it was being cared for by a New York company \u2014 raising doubts that the government will recoup its investments. </p>\n\n<p>The USDA is supposed to take custody of properties purchased with a Section 502 direct loan and begin the foreclosure process when the homeowner becomes incapacitated, dies or has abandoned it, according to the agency\u2019s handbook. Otherwise the properties may languish and lose value.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        <p>It really undermines the concept of giving access to homeownership to a population who might not otherwise have been able to afford it.</p>\n\n    \n        \n        \u2014Rhiannon Hampson, former USDA rural development director for Maine\n\n    \n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Agency guidelines do not specify how soon the government should step in after a loan falls into delinquency, but under federal law, lenders cannot foreclose on a property until borrowers have been in default for 120 days.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly a fifth of the USDA\u2019s 159,208 Section 502 direct loans in its active national portfolio \u2014 30,496 \u2014 were delinquent as of March, according to internal agency data obtained by the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica. That rate is double what a 1993 internal agency report said was acceptable. But neither the USDA nor the White House would say why the agency is focusing on foreclosures in Maine. Vermont is the only other state in which the USDA has filed a single foreclosure, according to federal court filings.</p>\n\n<p>The foreclosures started just before Trump\u2019s Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/04/16/news/maine-attorney-general-pam-bondi-civil-rights-lawsuit-title-ix-maine-department-of-education-transgender-athletes/\">sued the state of Maine</a> in April over its inclusion of transgender athletes in girls\u2019 sports, part of a larger spat between Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills. The White House would not say whether the foreclosures are connected in any way to those ongoing conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration is seeking to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf\">eliminate the 76-year-old rural homeownership program</a> in the <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/resource/president-trump-releases-skinny-budget-request-foreshadowing-historic-cuts-hud-full-fy26\">White House\u2019s budget proposal</a> for the 2026 fiscal year. Some of his predecessors, including Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have also sought to cut back the $880 million direct mortgage program, which has bipartisan support in Congress.</p>\n\n<p>A USDA spokesperson said the Trump administration is in the process of reviewing the loans to \u201cunderstand the magnitude of the problems it has inherited.\u201d The agency noted that in Maine alone, more than 800 properties are considered delinquent and nearly 400 homes are being tracked for foreclosure. The USDA did not respond to additional questions.</p>\n\n\u201cHopelessly in Debt\u201d\n<p>In 2013, months after the Caribou woman had abandoned her property, she received a letter at her new residence from the USDA informing her that she had to pay the government $22,000 in missed mortgage payments and late fees or she\u2019d lose the Caribou home, said Cox, her lawyer. He said she did not pay because she did not want the house anymore. The USDA sent her nearly a dozen letters between 2014 and 2015 claiming foreclosure was imminent, but a decade passed before she was served with foreclosure papers this spring. </p>\n\n<p>A sign on the front door says the property is being maintained by a New York City company, which did not return calls seeking comment. A green tarp stretches across missing sections of the roof. Inside, piles of garbage and feces litter the floor.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n\n                            \n                                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n\n            The dilapidated state of the house a woman bought with a USDA mortgage in Caribou, Maine\n    \n            (Courtesy of Tom Cox)\n    \n    \n    \n\n            \n                    \n    \n                    \n<p>A real estate broker who inspected the home in June with Cox estimated the value of the house to be around $40,000, a steep depreciation from the 2006 purchase price of $144,000. </p>\n\n<p>During the time since she abandoned the property, what the woman owes USDA continued to balloon, Cox said. </p>\n\n<p>His client now owes the government $393,463, according to court documents \u2014 nearly 10 times what the home is worth. Nearly 60% of that comprises interest that accumulated after she defaulted, as well as $91,304 in \u201cpreservation and inspection\u201d fees. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf the USDA had dealt with this back in 2012, they might have gotten most or all of their money back by selling the home\u201d before it deteriorated, Cox said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to collect it now. It\u2019s a huge waste of government resources and money to let this happen.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Other USDA borrowers simply continue living in their homes long after they default on their loans, accumulating more debt with each passing year that the government does not move to collect.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        <p>It\u2019s a huge waste of government resources and money to let this happen.</p>\n\n    \n        \n        \u2014Attorney Tom Cox\n\n    \n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Christine Ogden had stopped paying the $465-a-month mortgage for her blue saltbox home in the coastal Maine town of Searsport in 2013, according to court documents. She said she told the USDA at the time to take her home after the agency threatened her with foreclosure if she did not pay.  </p>\n\n<p>But it took the government until 2019 to attempt to foreclose upon her property. The case was dismissed in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. Five years later, in April, she received a summons to appear in federal court to start foreclosure proceedings again.</p>\n\n<p>Ogden now owes $203,787 on what had been a $66,200 mortgage, according to court documents. Half of her debt comprises interest that accumulated after she defaulted, as well as other fees she would not have had to pay had the USDA addressed the delinquency sooner, an analysis by the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica found. </p>\n\n<p>Ogden, who has lived rent-free in the house for 12 years, says she is unable to pay the burgeoning debt and does not know what will happen. The foreclosure will hurt her credit, making it harder for her to get another loan or find rental housing, she said. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI'm 59,\u201d Ogden said. \u201cI\u2019ll be homeless, basically.\u201d </p>\n\nLittle Government Oversight\n<p>The owners of another property, in Norridgewock in central Maine, also stopped paying their mortgage \u2014 and moved out of the house \u2014 years before the USDA foreclosed on the home this spring, court records show. The owners have not appeared to live at the property since at least 2014, according to property tax records, and defaulted on their loan in 2019 \u2014 but the government did not file for foreclosure until April. </p>\n\n<p>The owners, it turned out, were violating USDA rules by renting out their home. The tenant, who answered the door when a reporter visited in May after the foreclosure was filed in federal court, would not share his name but estimated that he has paid $100,000 in rent to the owners during the 12 years he said he has lived there. USDA guidelines allow borrowers to rent their homes for up to three years, and only under very narrow circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Properties purchased under the 502 direct loan program are supposed to be the borrower\u2019s permanent residence and not meant to generate income, according to <a href=\"https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/single-family-housing-programs/single-family-housing-direct-home-loans-10\">USDA guidelines</a>. Homeowners can rent out their properties only due to certain life events such as if their families outgrow their current home or if they are moving for a job. But the borrower must still pay the mortgage every month.</p>\n\n<p>The USDA says the owners of the Norridgewock home owe the agency $276,191. The homeowners live in Tennessee, according to foreclosure summons and other court records filed this year by the USDA; they did not respond to calls made to phone numbers listed under their names.</p>\n\n<p>USDA staff based in Maine who once were in close touch with borrowers when they ran into financial trouble now have little to no oversight of Section 502 loans. That\u2019s because a major restructuring in the 1990s eliminated many of the county offices that had managed all aspects of the loans and centralized the servicing of these loans to an office in St. Louis, said Leslie Strauss, a senior policy analyst for the Housing Assistance Council, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit focused on affordable rural housing.</p>\n\n<p>These changes came on the heels of an internal study in 1991 concluding that centralizing the administration of these loans would result in better service and a lower delinquency rate of about 10%, according to a <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/rced-93-231br\">1993 report</a> by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. More than three decades later, the delinquency rate for Section 502 direct loans has nearly doubled to 19%. </p>\n\n<p>Hampson, Maine\u2019s former USDA rural development official who now leads economic development for the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, said she had been pushing the agency to allow local staff to regain oversight of borrowers\u2019 financial situations \u201cso that we can go out and monitor what\u2019s going on, so that we aren\u2019t caught by surprise.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But her effort did not gain traction, Hampson said. </p>\n\n<p>As the foreclosures accumulated in Maine in recent months, the USDA website <a href=\"https://www.rd.usda.gov/media/file/download/maine-sfh-pay-asst-memo-may-2025.pdf\">published an advisory</a> directing struggling Maine borrowers to call the St. Louis office for help. But fewer staff members are available to respond after Trump\u2019s recent cuts to the federal workforce.</p>\n\n<p>As of early May, 1,536 employees \u2014 nearly a third of the rural development office \u2014 had taken the buyout, according to USDA documents outlining the results of the Trump administration\u2019s two financial incentive offers to quit. Of those, 197 worked in the St. Louis office.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford failure,\u201d Hampson said of the long-delayed foreclosures leading to insurmountable debt. \u201cThe onus is on the government to make sure that we\u2019re providing the right kind of safety nets to prevent this sort of thing from happening.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.bangordailynews.com/author/mshepherd/\">Michael Shepherd</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bangordailynews.com/author/sray/\">Sasha Ray</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bangordailynews.com/author/pbrewer/\">Paula Brewer</a> of BDN contributed reporting. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/mariam-elba\">Mariam Elba</a> of ProPublica contributed research.</p>",

Adams, former officials said, was so close to the unit he had access to a little-known livestream of the CRT\u2019s body-worn camera footage, a detail that Donlon cited in his legal complaint.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What They Said:</strong> \u201cThe Community Response Team speaks to the culture under Adams of willfully violating the constitutional rights of civilians and officers,\u201d John Scola, Donlon\u2019s lawyer, told ProPublica. That culture is: \u201cWe\u2019ll do whatever we want.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> In 2023, a senior NYPD official wrote a scathing internal audit after finding that CRT officers were wrongfully stopping New Yorkers and failing to document the incidents. Weeks later, Adams took to Instagram to boost the unit. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CuQ1thnMJJy/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=a0de6eaf-c574-4c60-bb2b-cce35a41005b&amp;img_index=2\">Turning out with the team</a>,\u201d he wrote, showing a photo of him wearing a wide smile and khaki pants, CRT\u2019s official uniform.</p>\n\n<p>The official who wrote that audit was pushed out months later. He and other top former commanders recently sued Adams alleging favoritism and misconduct, charges the mayor denies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Donlon, a former FBI agent who held the job of police commissioner for only two months, from September to November 2024, lobbed his accusations against Adams as the mayor has been waging an uphill battle to keep his job. Adams was indicted last fall on federal charges of bribery, fraud and illegally taking campaign contributions from foreigners. He pleaded not guilty. He avoided trial by making a deal with President Donald Trump, who dropped the prosecution in exchange for Adams working with the administration on immigration enforcement. Still, he remains unpopular in the city and is running for reelection as an independent against a popular Democrat, Zohran Mamdani.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Response:</strong> In a statement, the mayor\u2019s office dismissed Donlon\u2019s claims.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese are baseless accusations from a disgruntled former employee who \u2014 when given the opportunity to lead the greatest police department in the world \u2014 proved himself to be ineffective,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis suit is nothing more than an attempt to seek compensation at the taxpayer\u2019s expense after Mr. Donlon was rightfully removed from the role of interim police commissioner.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Previously, Adam has defended the CRT. Asked about the unit at a press conference this spring, the mayor said, \u201cCRT is here.\u201d He continued, \u201cI support all my units.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The NYPD did not respond to requests for comment about the suit.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT Q&amp;A \u2014 </strong><em><em>President Donald Trump has offered a strong hand of support to Ukraine in recent days, pledging new weapons and threatening Russia with tariffs and sanctions if it does not end the war. It\u2019s a reversal from previous engagement with Moscow, which has failed to result in any substantial progress to peace.</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Cipher Brief spoke with former senior CIA officer and 6-time station chief Ralph Goff - who has traveled to Ukraine and the region multiple times since the Russian war in Ukraine began - about why he believes Putin has pushed too far this time and about how Europe sees the Russian threat beyond Ukraine. This interview - which you'll only find in The Cipher Brief - has been edited for length and clarity.</em></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong>You were in Lithuania during the NATO summit. What was your sense there about the threat that Russia really poses to Europe today?</em></p><p><em><strong><em>Goff: </em></strong></em>Unlike the United States, where most people probably followed the NATO summit tangentially, the summit was pretty much front and center in the news in Lithuania. The Baltic States, being frontline states, the NATO border with the Russian Federation, the people there, not just the politicians, but the people, the public, tend to follow these security issues such as NATO quite closely because they see the threat literally every day across the border.</p><p>It was interesting because the summit was pretty much a victory lap by President Trump. In his first administration, he pressured Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the others to increase their military spending. And he had some success there. But then of course, there was some backsliding in the intervening years. And now, once again, he's been pressuring our European allies to step up their defense spending, seeking this 5% commitment from the member states, which he by and large got. The summit was interesting because he got what he wanted.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong>Trump may be getting what he wants from NATO, but he's certainly not getting what he wants from Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 which is to bring about an end to the war in Ukraine. His frustration seems to be growing over the last few weeks as he's realized that Putin is not really making any significant progress toward a ceasefire deal.</em></p><p><em><strong><em>Goff: </em></strong></em>I think Putin has drastically overplayed his hand with President Trump. I think Putin, the old KGB case officer, was rather condescending to the president. I think he overestimated his skills as a case officer, where he thought he could manipulate and flatter the president into performing the way he wanted \u2014 and that didn't happen.</p><p>President Trump likes President Putin; they're both very transactional people. From President Vladimir Putin\u2019s side, all he had to do was behave himself. And he didn't. He had President Trump bludgeoning Kyiv into a position to accept some sort of peace negotiations. And the Ukrainians were in line. Meanwhile in Russia, they did nothing. Vladimir Putin, in fact, doubled down. In the last week, the air attacks on Ukraine have been unprecedented. Before, the norm was 30 to 40, maybe 80 drones at night attacking various Ukrainian cities. Now they're firing hundreds of them at night, along with scores of cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles, air-to-air missiles, the S-300s used in ground attack mode.</p><p>Putin has doubled down looking to break the Ukrainian will with his attacks, and it hasn't worked. The exact opposite has happened. Now he's got President Trump upset with him. President Trump feels that he\u2019s done everything he could to mollify Putin and kind of see things his way, and it hasn't worked. So now it's time to try something else. That had a lot to do with how he changed his mind on NATO as well.</p><p>When Putin invaded Ukraine, he gave them one one bloody gift: he gave them their national identity. After the attack, it was clear to Ukrainians they were Ukrainians. Their national identity was firm. And Donald Trump kind of did the same thing where he kind of turned his back on NATO. He expressed his skepticism, he kind of made them think that perhaps at some point the United States wouldn't not take a leading role in NATO and force the Europeans to grow up to suddenly not just talk about playing a more active role in NATO but actually do it as well. So now instead of just meetings where they issue polite statements, you have NATO where they're spending more money and they're rebuilding their defense industrial complex. So it's a big change, and I would say Vladimir Putin has no one to blame but himself.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em>Sign up today</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em>.</em></strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong>As of Monday, July 14,<strong> </strong>President Trump was giving Vladimir Putin another 50 days to come to an agreement to cease fire. From a non-expert perspective, I would think that the Russian President would use that 50 days to pound Ukraine even harder to try to create as much devastation as he can. How likely do you think that President Putin is going to change any part of his behavior in this 50-day window that President Trump has offered?</em></p><p><em><strong><em>Goff: </em></strong></em>One thing Vladimir Putin is very consistent about is that he does not respond to pressure. It takes a lot to get Putin to move and it's going to take a lot more than a 50 day deadline, right? President Trump has become very fond of deadlines such as the deadline imposed on Iran before striking them. I guess that's a tool that he sees some usefulness for.</p><p>But with Vladimir Putin, I don't really think deadlines are gonna have any impact. What will matter is the actions that come through. You've got a very robust set of sanctions that the Senate has prepared under the leadership of Senator Lindsey Graham. He says something like 84 senators are in support of what is supposedly a more robust package of sanctions than the White House had developed. So we'll see where that goes.</p><p>And then there\u2019s also getting the Europeans to crack down. Getting the Europeans not just to commit to spending more money, but to also commit to providing that aid immediately to the Ukrainians. Then there's things like getting Europe fully off of Russian oil. They're still buying oil and gas from Russia. Although they say by the end of 2027, I think they're supposed to be off of it. And in the meantime, things like cracking down on the so-called shadow fleet that the Russians have. There's a lot that can be done there to stem the flow of oil out of Russia and the money that goes back in for that oil.</p><p>And then things like when you see provocations in the Baltic Sea \u2014 sabotage of underwater internet cables or other type of infrastructure between the Nordic states and the Baltics \u2014 that there\u2019s a response. Maybe we're seeing a hint of that with what triggered some remarks from Russia, where the Estonians did a test firing of their HIMARS batteries out to sea. It shows that they can cover a good chunk of the Baltic Sea from the shores of Estonia. So, there's a lot that the NATO countries and the United States can do to put pressure on Putin within that 50-day window. The trick is not to wait until the end of it, but to start ratcheting out now.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

You've got sizable Russian minorities in the Baltic regions. For instance, Estonia is a country of about 1.4 million people and they have about 300,000 Russians, the bulk of whom live in one area kind of in the northeast, the town of Narva. One could see a situation where little green men show up in Narva to protect the Russian population from some sort of perceived Estonian nationalists. Then you know what we're looking at is not just the Crimea where russia successfully annexed a part of the Ukraine, but an incursion into a NATO country which is protected under Article Five. I would say any kind of information operations against Estonia and the other Baltic countries, Latvia and Lithuania, any kind of increased sabotage activity, gray zone activity in the Baltics, that would be signs that maybe there's worse to come. So we really have to be vigilant there.</p><p><em><strong><em>Are you Subscribed to </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> on YouTube?

Kennedy Jr. wants to overhaul an obscure but vital program that underpins the nation\u2019s childhood immunization system.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on what he does, the results could be catastrophic.</p>\n\n<p>In his crosshairs is the <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation\">Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a>, a system designed to provide fair and quick payouts for people who suffer rare but serious side effects from shots \u2014 without having to prove that drugmakers were negligent. Congress created the program in the 1980s when lawsuits drove vaccine makers from the market. A special tax on immunizations funds the awards, and manufacturers benefit from legal protections that make it harder to win big-money verdicts against them in civil courts.</p>\n\n<p>Kennedy, who founded an anti-vaccination group and previously accused the pharmaceutical industry of inflicting \u201cunnecessary and risky vaccines\u201d on children for profits, has long argued that the program removes any incentive for the industry to make safe products.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://tuckercarlson.com/tucker-show-rfk-jr-2025\">interview with Tucker Carlson</a>, Kennedy condemned what he called corruption in the program and said he had assigned a team to overhaul it and expand who could seek compensation. He didn\u2019t detail his plans but did repeat the long-debunked claim that vaccines cause autism and suggested, without citing any evidence, that shots could also be responsible for a litany of chronic ailments, from diabetes to narcolepsy.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of ways he could blow up the program and prompt vaccine makers to stop selling shots in the U.S., like they did in the 1980s. The trust fund that pays awards, for instance, could run out of money if the government made it easy for Kennedy\u2019s laundry list of common health problems to qualify for payments from the fund.</p>\n\n<p>Or he could pick away at the program one shot at a time. Right now, immunizations routinely <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/covered-vaccines\">recommended for children or pregnant women</a> are covered by the program. Kennedy has the power to drop vaccines from the list, a move that would open up their manufacturers to the kinds of lawsuits that made them flee years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Eddy Bresnitz, who served as New Jersey\u2019s state epidemiologist and then spent a dozen years as a vaccine executive at Merck, is among those worried.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf his unstated goal is to basically destroy the vaccine industry, that could do it,\u201d said Bresnitz, who retired from Merck and has consulted for vaccine manufacturers. \u201cI still believe, having worked in the industry, that they care about protecting American health, but they are also for-profit companies with shareholders, and anything that detracts from the bottom line that can be avoided, they will avoid.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for <a href=\"https://phrma.org/\">PhRMA</a>, a U.S. trade group for pharmaceutical companies, told ProPublica in a written statement that upending the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program \u201cwould threaten continued patient access to FDA approved vaccines.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The spokesperson, Andrew Powaleny, said the program \u201chas compensated thousands of claims while helping ensure the continued availability of a safe and effective vaccine supply. It remains a vital safeguard for public health and importantly doesn\u2019t shield manufacturers from liability.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Since its inception, the compensation fund has <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vicp/vicp-stats-06-01-25.pdf\">paid about $4.8 billion</a> in awards for harm from serious side effects, such as life-threatening allergic reactions and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an autoimmune condition that can cause paralysis. The federal agency that oversees the program found that for every 1 million doses of vaccine distributed between 2006 and 2023, about <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vicp/vicp-stats-06-01-25.pdf\">one person was compensated</a> for an injury.</p>\n\n<p>Since becoming Health and Human Services secretary, Kennedy has turned the staid world of immunizations on its ear. He reneged on the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/health/kennedy-vaccines-gavi.html\">U.S. government\u2019s pledge</a> to fund vaccinations for the world\u2019s poorest kids. He fired every member of the federal advisory group that recommends which shots Americans get, and his new slate vowed to scrutinize the U.S. childhood immunization schedule. Measles, a vaccine-preventable disease eliminated here in 2000, roared back and hit a grim record \u2014 more cases than the U.S. has seen in 33 years, including three deaths. When a U.S. senator asked Kennedy if he recommended measles shots, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO7eteLb178\">Kennedy answered</a>, \u201cSenator, if I advised you to swim in a lake that I knew there to be alligators in, wouldn\u2019t you want me to tell you there were alligators in it?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Fed up, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical societies sued Kennedy last week, <a href=\"https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/FiledSuit.pdf\">accusing him of dismantling</a> \u201cthe longstanding, Congressionally-authorized, science- and evidence-based vaccine infrastructure that has prevented the deaths of untold millions of Americans.\u201d (The federal government has yet to respond to the suit.)</p>\n\n<p>Just about all drugs have side effects. What\u2019s unusual about vaccines is that they\u2019re given to healthy people \u2014 even newborns on their first day of life. And many shots protect not just the individuals receiving them but also the broader community by making it harder for deadly scourges to spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that routine childhood immunizations have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm?s\">prevented more than 1.1 million deaths</a> and 32 million hospitalizations among the generation of Americans born between 1994 and 2023.</p>\n\n<p>To most people, the nation\u2019s vaccine system feels like a solid, reliable fact of life, doling out shots to children like clockwork. But in reality it is surprisingly fragile.</p>\n\n<p>There are only a handful of companies that make nearly all of the shots children receive. Only one manufacturer makes chickenpox vaccines. And just two or three make the shots that protect against more than a dozen diseases, including polio and measles. If any were to drop out, the country could find itself in the same crisis that led President Ronald Reagan to sign the law creating the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in 1986.</p>\n\n<p>Back then, pharmaceutical companies faced hundreds of lawsuits alleging that the vaccine protecting kids from whooping cough, diphtheria and tetanus caused unrelenting seizures that led to severe disabilities. (Today\u2019s version of this shot is different.) One vaccine maker after another <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/12/us/maker-of-vaccine-quits-the-market.html\">left the U.S. market</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At one point, pediatricians could only buy whooping cough vaccines from a single company. Shortages were so bad that the CDC recommended doctors <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000452.htm\">stop giving booster shots</a> to preserve supplies for the most vulnerable babies.</p>\n\n<p>While Congress debated what to do, public health clinics\u2019 cost per dose jumped 5,000% in five years.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe were really concerned that we would lose all vaccines, and we would get major resurgences of vaccine-preventable diseases,\u201d recalled Dr. Walter Orenstein, a vaccine expert who worked in the CDC\u2019s immunization division at the time.</p>\n\n<p>A Forbes headline captured the anxiety of parents, pediatricians and public health workers: \u201cScared Shotless.\u201d So a bipartisan group in Congress hammered out the no-fault system.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the program covers vaccines routinely <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/covered-vaccines\">recommended for children or pregnant women</a> once Congress approves the special tax that funds awards. (COVID-19 shots are part of a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46982#:~:text=HRSA%20reports%20that%20as%20of,eligible%20for%20compensation%20(1.6%25).\">separate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/health/covid-vaccines-side-effects.html\">often-maligned</a> system for handling claims of harm, though Kennedy has said he\u2019s looking at ways to add them to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.)</p>\n\n<p>Under program rules, people who say they are harmed by covered vaccines can\u2019t head straight to civil court to sue manufacturers. First, they have to go through the no-fault system. The law established a <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vicp/vaccine-injury-table-01-03-2022.pdf\">table of injuries</a> and the time frame for when those conditions must have appeared in order to be considered for quicker payouts. A tax on those vaccines \u2014 now 75 cents for every disease that a shot protects against \u2014 flows into a trust fund that pays those approved for awards. Win or lose, the program, for the most part, pays attorney fees and forbids lawyers from taking a cut of the money paid to the injured.</p>\n\n<p>The law set up a dedicated vaccine court where government officials known as special masters, who operate like judges, rule on cases without juries. People can ask for compensation for health problems not listed on the injury table, and they don\u2019t have to prove that the vaccine maker was negligent or failed to warn them about the medical condition they wound up with. At the same time, they can\u2019t claim punitive damages, which drive up payouts in civil courts, and pain and suffering payments are capped at $250,000.</p>\n\n<p>Plaintiffs who aren\u2019t satisfied with the outcome or whose cases drag on too long can exit the program and file their cases in traditional civil courts. There they can pursue punitive damages, contingency-fee agreements with lawyers and the usual evidence gathering that plaintiffs use to hold companies accountable for wrongdoing.</p>\n\n<p>But a Supreme Court ruling, interpreting the law that created the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, limited the kinds of claims that can prevail in civil court. So while the program isn\u2019t a full liability shield for vaccine makers, its very existence significantly narrows the cases trial lawyers can file.</p>\n\n<p>Kennedy has been involved in such civil litigation. In his federal disclosures, he revealed that he referred plaintiffs to a law firm filing cases against Merck over its HPV shot in exchange for a 10% cut of the fees if they win. After a heated exchange with Sen. Elizabeth Warren during his confirmation proceedings, Kennedy said his share of any money from those cases would instead go to one of his adult sons, who he later said is a lawyer in California. His son Conor works as an attorney at the Los Angeles law firm benefiting from his referrals. When ProPublica asked about this arrangement, Conor Kennedy wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t work on those cases and I\u2019m not receiving any money from them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In March, a North Carolina federal judge overseeing hundreds of cases that alleged Merck failed to warn patients about serious side effects from its HPV vaccine <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-prevails-gardasil-safety-litigation-2025-03-11/\">ruled in favor of Merck</a>; an appeal is pending.</p>\n\n<p>The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program succeeded in stabilizing the business of childhood vaccines, with many more shots developed and approved in the decades since it was established. But even ardent supporters acknowledge there are problems. The program\u2019s staff levels haven\u2019t kept up with the caseload. The law capped the number of special masters at eight, and congressional bills to increase that have failed. An influx of adult claims swamped the system after adverse reactions to flu shots became eligible for compensation in 2005 and serious shoulder problems were added to the injury table in 2017.</p>\n\n<p>The quick and smooth system of payouts originally envisioned has evolved into a more adversarial one with lawyers for the Department of Justice duking it out with plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, which Kennedy says runs counter to the program\u2019s intent. Many cases drag on for years.</p>\n\n<p>In his recent interview with Carlson, he described \u201cthe lawyers of the Department of Justice, the leaders of it\u201d working on the cases as corrupt. \u201cThey saw their job as protecting the trust fund rather than taking care of people who made this national sacrifice, and we\u2019re going to change all that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve brought in a team this week that is starting to work on that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The system is \u201csupposed to be generous and fast and gives a tie to the runner,\u201d he told Carlson. \u201cIn other words, if there\u2019s doubts about, you know, whether somebody\u2019s injury came from a vaccine or not, you\u2019re going to assume they got it and compensate them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Kennedy didn\u2019t identify who is on the team reviewing the program. At one point in the interview, he said, \u201cWe just brought a guy in this week who\u2019s going to be revolutionizing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The HHS employee directory now lists Andrew Downing as a counselor working in Kennedy\u2019s office. Downing for many years has filed claims with the program and suits in civil courts on behalf of clients alleging harm from shots. Last month, HHS awarded a <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75P00125P00036_7570_-NONE-_-NONE-\">contract for \u201cVaccine Injury Compensation Program expertise\u201d</a> to <a href=\"https://bss.law/team-member/drew-downing/\">Downing\u2019s firm</a>, as <a href=\"https://www.notus.org/health-science/hhs-award-vaccine-injury-compensation-program\">NOTUS has reported</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Downing did not respond to a voicemail left at his law office. HHS didn\u2019t reply to a request to make him and Kennedy available for an interview and declined to answer detailed questions about its plans for the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. In the past, an HHS spokesperson has said that Kennedy is \u201cnot anti-vaccine \u2014 he is pro-safety.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>While it\u2019s not clear what changes Downing and Kennedy have in mind, Kennedy\u2019s interview with Carlson offered some insights. Kennedy said he was working to expand the program\u2019s three-year statute of limitations so that more people can be compensated. <a href=\"https://www.standinguptopots.org/potscast/e171-post-gardasil-pots-litigation-with-attorney-drew-downing/\">Downing has complained</a> that patients who have certain autoimmune disorders don\u2019t realize their ailments were caused by a vaccine until it\u2019s too late to file. Congress would have to change the law to allow this, experts said.</p>\n\n<p>A key issue is whether Kennedy will try to add new ailments to the list of injuries that qualify for quicker awards.</p>\n\n<p>In the Carlson interview, Kennedy dismissed the many studies and scientific consensus that shots don\u2019t cause autism as nothing more than statistical trickery. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do real science,\u201d Kennedy said.</p>\n\n<p>The vaccine court spent years in the 2000s trying cases that alleged autism was caused by the vaccine ingredient thimerosal and the shot that protects people from measles, mumps and rubella. Facing more than 5,000 claims, the court asked a committee of attorneys representing children with autism to pick test cases that represented themes common in the broader group. In the cases that went to trial, the special masters considered more than 900 medical articles and heard testimony from dozens of experts. In each of those cases, the <a href=\"https://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism-decisions-and-background-information\">special masters found</a> that the shots didn\u2019t cause autism.</p>\n\n<p>In at least two subsequent cases, children with autism were granted compensation because they met the criteria listed in the program\u2019s injury table, according to a vaccine court decision. That table, for instance, lists certain forms of encephalopathy \u2014 a type of brain dysfunction \u2014 as a rare side effect of shots that protect people from whooping cough, measles, mumps and rubella. In a 2016 vaccine court ruling, Special Master George L. Hastings Jr. explained, \u201cThe compensation of these two cases, thus does not afford any support to the notion that vaccinations can contribute to the causation of autism.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Hastings noted that when Congress set up the injury table, the lawmakers acknowledged that people would get compensated for \u201csome injuries that were not, in fact, truly vaccine-caused.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Many disabling neurological disorders in children become apparent around the time kids get their shots. Figuring out whether the timing was coincidental or an indication that the vaccines caused the problem has been a huge challenge.</p>\n\n<p>Devastating seizures in young children were the impetus for the compensation program. But in the mid-1990s, after a yearslong review of the evidence, HHS <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1995-02-08/html/95-2945.htm#:~:text=SUMMARY:%20This%20final%20rule%20amends,is%20effective%20March%2010%2C%201995.\">removed seizure disorder from the injury table</a> and narrowed the type of encephalopathy that would automatically qualify for compensation. Scientists subsequently have discovered genetic mutations that cause some of the most severe forms of epilepsy.</p>\n\n<p>What\u2019s different now, though, is that Kennedy, as HHS secretary, has the power to add autism or other disorders to that injury table. Experts say he\u2019d have to go through the federal government\u2019s cumbersome rulemaking process to do so. He could also lean on federal employees to green-light more claims.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Kennedy has made it clear he\u2019s thinking about illnesses beyond autism. \u201cWe have now this epidemic of immune dysregulation in our country, and there\u2019s no way to rule out vaccines as one of the key culprits,\u201d he told Carlson. Kennedy mentioned diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, seizure disorders, ADHD, speech delay, language delay, tics, Tourette syndrome, narcolepsy, peanut allergies and eczema.</p>\n\n<p>President Donald Trump\u2019s budget estimated that the value of the investments in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program trust fund could reach $4.8 billion this year. While that\u2019s a lot of money, a life-care plan for a child with severe autism can cost tens of millions of dollars, and the CDC reported in April that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/ss/ss7402a1.htm\">1 in 31 children</a> is diagnosed with autism by their 8th birthday. The other illnesses Kennedy mentioned also affect a wide swath of the U.S. population.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Paul Offit, a co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, for years has sparred with Kennedy over vaccines. Offit fears that Kennedy will use flawed studies to justify adding autism and other common medical problems to the injury table, no matter how much they conflict with robust scientific research.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can do that, and you will bankrupt the program,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are ways to end vaccine manufacturing in this country.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>If the trust fund were to run out of money, Congress would have to act, said Dorit Reiss, a law professor at University of California Law San Francisco who has studied the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Congress could increase the excise tax on vaccines, she said, or pass a law limiting what\u2019s on the injury table. Or Congress could abolish the program, and the vaccine makers would find themselves back in the situation they faced in the 1980s.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not unrealistic,\u201d Reiss said.</p>\n\n<p>Rep. Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, last year proposed the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9828#:~:text=Summary%20of%20H.R.9828%20-%20118th%20Congress\">End the Vaccine Carveout Act</a>, which would have allowed people to bypass the no-fault system and head straight to civil court. His press release for the bill \u2014 written in September, before Kennedy\u2019s ascension to HHS secretary \u2014 <a href=\"https://gosar.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=8582\">quoted Kennedy</a> saying, \u201cIf we want safe and effective vaccines, we need to end the liability shield.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The legislation never came up for a vote. A spokesperson for the congressman said he expects to introduce it again \u201cin the very near future.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ren\u00e9e Gentry, director of the George Washington University Law School\u2019s Vaccine Injury Litigation Clinic, thinks it\u2019s unlikely Congress will blow up the no-fault program. But Gentry, who represents people filing claims for injuries, said it\u2019s hard to predict what Congress, faced with a doomsday scenario, would do.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNormally Democrats are friends of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers,\u201d she said. \u201cBut talking about vaccines on the Hill is like walking on a razor blade that\u2019s on fire.\u201d</p>",

One FDA inspector saw a worker put on a sterile gown and then brush up against a waste bin and use their hands to push down the overflowing trash. Investigators also saw liquid dripping through ceiling cracks and the growth of what appeared to be fungus and mold in a storage area for samples used for testing.</p>\n\n<p>The FDA in late 2022 had banned the factory in the city of Halol from shipping drugs to the United States because of similar manufacturing failures.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/fda-drug-loophole-sun-pharma\">ProPublica reported last month</a> that a low-profile group inside the agency at the same time exempted some medications from that ban, ostensibly to prevent drug shortages. The FDA has granted similar exemptions for drugs made at more than 20 other foreign factories that violated critical standards in drugmaking and were barred from the U.S. market.</p>\n\n<p>The FDA kept the practice largely hidden from the public. The agency did not regularly test drugs coming from the banned factories or proactively monitor reports about potential harm among consumers, ProPublica found.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In Sun\u2019s case, more than a dozen drugs were initially excluded from the Halol import ban. The company is still allowed to send five to the United States, <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_189.html\">government records show</a>, including vecuronium bromide, a muscle relaxer used during surgery, and the cancer drug doxorubicin. Also excluded are divalproex delayed release tablets, which treat seizures and other conditions; leuprolide injection, used by people with prostate cancer, endometriosis and other conditions; and temozolomide capsules, for brain cancer.</p>\n\n<p>The inspection last month marked the first time the FDA had been back to the factory in the 2.5 years since it imposed the import ban and Sun started sending exempted drugs to the United States. Inspectors found that procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of sterile drugs were not established or followed and that equipment wasn\u2019t maintained to prevent malfunctions that would \u201calter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the drug product,\u201d according to the report. </p>\n\n<p>Some of the concerns focused on the exempted drugs still being sent to the United States, according to a person familiar with the situation who did not want to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The FDA <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25998843-sun-pharma-2025-483/#document/p15/a2664414\">blacked out the names of the drugs</a> that were potentially compromised on its publicly released inspection report, including a medication made on a manufacturing line in which several batches had to be rejected because they were filled with black particles.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            A portion of the FDA\u2019s June inspection report redacted the names of potentially compromised drugs manufactured by Sun that continue to be released to the U.S. market.\n    \n            (Obtained by ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see issues continue to come up at this site given the site\u2019s role in potentially manufacturing critical drugs for U.S. consumers,\u201d said the person familiar with the inspection findings. </p>\n\n<p>Sun did not respond to questions about the latest inspection or its regulatory history with the FDA. In an email, the company said that adherence to quality standards \u201cis a top priority for Sun, and we maintain a relentless focus on quality and compliance to ensure the uninterrupted supply of medicines to our customers and patients worldwide. We continue to work proactively with the US FDA and remain committed to achieve full resolution of any FDA regulatory issues at our facilities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The FDA said factories that receive exemptions from import bans are required to conduct extra testing on drugs with third-party oversight before they are sent to the United States, helping to ensure patient safety. Sun\u2019s Halol plant, however, was cited in 2022 and again last month for failing to thoroughly investigate unexplained quality problems, including impurities, found during drug testing. The FDA did not respond to a request for comment about the latest Sun inspection. </p>\n\n<p>U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Michigan, who recently <a href=\"https://debbiedingell.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5712\">co-sponsored a bill</a> to lower prescription drug costs, said in a statement to ProPublica that the FDA has a responsibility to ensure that drugs coming into the country are safe.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe need full transparency about the extent to which exemptions enabled sub-par, unsafe, or ineffective drugs to be distributed to American patients,\u201d she said.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Medill Investigative Lab student Katherine Dailey contributed reporting.</p>",

Trump also issued an ultimatum of additional U.S. sanctions if Russian President Vladimir Putin fails to end his attacks and agree to a ceasefire within 50 days \u2013 as of Monday.</p><p>Amid the barrage of Russian attacks, experts note that the commitment of additional Patriot systems will allow Ukraine to defend itself but won\u2019t do much to move the needle toward ending the war, unless Putin flinches at the threat of sanctions, which he has not done. \u201cUkraine was given just enough support not to lose against Russia under President Joe Biden, but never enough support to actually win and end this war,\u201d writes former Chief of CIA\u2019s Central Eurasia Division Rob Dannenberg in a piece exclusive to <em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/trump-winning-president-ukraine\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> </em>this week. Meanwhile, there are signs that President Trump\u2019s patience is wearing thin.</p><p>The White House responded yesterday to the readout of a July 4 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that signaled the president\u2019s interest in Ukraine\u2019s ability to launch <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b66f03b5-e295-4f8c-92ba-516a527d588c\" target=\"_blank\">deep strikes</a> on Russian territory. Sources familiar with the call said Trump asked Zelensky, \u201cVolodymyr, can you hit Moscow? Can you hit St. Petersburg, too?\u201d Zelensky reportedly replied, \u201cAbsolutely. We can, if you give us the weapons.\u201d</p><p>While the administration downplayed the report, saying President Trump \u201cwas merely asking a question, not encouraging further killing,\u201d a White House spokesperson said Trump also said Zelensky \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-zelenskiy-should-not-target-moscow-2025-07-15/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shouldn\u2019t target Moscow</a>\u201d. In the meantime, Kyiv has been incredibly innovative in working with what it has available, to strike at the heart of Russian aggression.</p><p>On June 1, in a military strike that stunned analysts worldwide, Ukraine launched a bold drone operation\u2014dubbed <em>Spider\u2019s Web</em>\u2014that struck four Russian air bases <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/graphics/UKRAINE-CRISIS/DRONES-RUSSIA/mypmjzayyvr/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">up to</a> 3,000 miles from Kyiv, reportedly destroying or damaging a dozen nuclear-capable bombers. Satellite imagery suggests that among the damaged aircraft were Tu-95s and Tu-22s, long-range bombers used to launch cruise missiles at Ukraine.</p><p>The drones\u2014simple quadcopters costing less than $1,000\u2014were reportedly guided through Russia\u2019s own 4G <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2025/06/ukrainian-attack-on-russian-bombers-shows-how-cheap-drones-could-upset-global-security/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">networks</a> and possibly using AI to avoid detection and strike with precision. While Moscow denied any significant damage and threatened retaliation, Western analysts saw something more significant: a clear sign that modern warfare is entering a new era. Small, inexpensive drones can now slip past advanced air defenses, giving countries like Ukraine a way to challenge far larger militaries.</p><p>However, the implications go far beyond Ukraine and Russia. The operation sent a clear message to militaries worldwide: Ukraine can strike deep into enemy territory with precision and surprise\u2014and others could, too.</p><p>\u201cIt suggests a new angle of surprise attack that our defenses need to adjust to,\u201d Kori Schake, director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt\u2019ll be very difficult to calibrate warning against small drone attacks. You can bet militaries are scrambling to figure it out.\u201d</p><p><strong>Moment of Reckoning</strong></p><p>While Russia\u2019s immediate damage was a significant setback, the true shockwave from Ukraine\u2019s <em>Spider\u2019s Web</em> operation spread far beyond the battlefield.</p><p>Military experts worldwide recognized this attack as a clear warning\u2014exposing new vulnerabilities and signaling a shift in how modern warfare will be fought.</p><p>U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/04/ukraine-attacks-us-dangers-aircraft-00385666\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">referred</a> to it as a \u201cwake-up moment,\u201d noting the sheer magnitude of destruction and the ease with which it was executed. As U.S. aircraft continue to sit exposed on runways across the Pacific and homeland, the risk of similar strikes has become more than theoretical.</p><p>Nolan Peterson, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and former Air Force Special Operations pilot, concurs that the operation was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the Pentagon and \u201cshowed how drones are now a bridge between conventional and unconventional combat, having democratized long-range, precision strike capabilities that were once exclusive to conventional state militaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the hands of conventional and unconventional operators, drones can have tactical, operational, and strategic effects \u2014 from precision strikes on the battlefield to disabling power stations and oil refineries, shutting down airports, or destroying nuclear-capable bombers sitting on the tarmac at an air base,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd, even if they are armed with relatively weak munitions, small drones now offer America\u2019s adversaries a low-cost, plausibly deniable way to spread panic and paralyze our economy.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

Coordination between federal agencies is sluggish, legal authorities are fragmented, and training at the base level hasn't kept pace with the growing threat, something U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth promises to change with a new plan to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJxD-Bjqk3w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">modernize DoD\u2019s use of drones</a>.</p><p>But beyond the technical vulnerabilities, the strategic implications of the June 1 strike are far-reaching. A new reality is emerging\u2014one in which commercial drones launched from anywhere near a military site, concealed in barns, trucks, or civilian buildings, can carry out devastating attacks once reserved for high-end missiles. As military drone technology becomes more autonomous and lethal, the urgency to adapt grows by the day.</p><p>\u201cMilitaries can\u2019t just rely on missiles and stealth jets anymore,\u201d said Nolan Peterson, former Air Force Special Operations pilot. \u201cDrones now serve as the bridge between conventional and unconventional warfare, granting near-peer capabilities to smaller actors.\u201d</p><p>Peterson warned that even relatively weak munitions, when paired with drone agility and scale, can paralyze economies, take down power grids, or disable key strategic aircraft\u2014often without attribution.</p><p>\u201cThis is the democratization of strategic strike,\u201d he said.</p><p>The United States, he added, must recognize that air superiority now hinges not only on dominance in the skies\u2014but in the so-called <em>air littoral</em>, the low-altitude zone where small drones thrive.</p><p>\u201cWe need a layered defense that combines traditional systems with new tech specifically designed to track and eliminate small UAVs, including both kinetic interceptors and directed energy weapons,\u201d Peterson said.</p><p><strong>In the future</strong></p><p>The June 1 drone strikes marked a turning point in global stability, exposing how small, low-cost drones can now threaten even the nuclear assets of major powers\u2014something once only possible for other nuclear states.</p><p>Traditional doctrines designed to prevent nuclear escalation were never built to handle strikes from smaller, non-nuclear actors like Ukraine or to anticipate the risk posed by non-state groups potentially launching false-flag operations to provoke conflict. As drones become cheaper and more accessible, their disruptive power demands urgent attention\u2014in ethical debates around AI autonomy and regulatory efforts to prevent misuse.</p><p>So, what can be done?</p><p>Justin Bronk, Senior Research Fellow for Airpower and Technology in the Military Sciences team at the Royal United Services Institute, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em> that the United States and most other NATO air forces should \u201curgently invest in reconditioning old Hardened Aircraft Shelters and building new ones since aircraft stored in such shelters when not in use are essentially invulnerable to small UAV attacks and are also much safer against a host of other potential threats than when out in the open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardened Aircraft Shelters are not difficult or high-risk technologies; their utility is clear against the threat, and Russia has already started building new ones at multiple fighter bases to defend against Ukrainian strikes,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cSecondarily, air forces need to both invest in soft-kill anti-UAV defenses such as jammers but recognize that the main defense against such attacks by infiltration teams with large numbers of explosive-equipped UAVs has to be the intelligence and security services.\u201d</p><p>Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research and the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, points out that now that the mode of the \u201csurprise\u201d attack is known, \u201cit is conceivable that people will start taking appropriate defensive measures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLight nets over aircraft, for example, jamming mobile networks, these kinds of things,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, it will add complexity and cost to operations, and no defense is perfect, but a reasonable defense is not impossible.\u201d</p><p>Some analysts also warn that governments <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2025/06/ukrainian-attack-on-russian-bombers-shows-how-cheap-drones-could-upset-global-security/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">may need</a> to treat small drones more like firearms, implementing tighter export controls and purchase restrictions, even if doing so would impede the booming commercial drone market. The attack also raises questions about artificial intelligence and its role on a drone-dominated battlefield in the future.</p><p>\u201cAI in weapons systems is nothing new, but the off-the-shelf and cheap implementation of AI is revolutionary,\u201d Retired Special Forces Colonel Jason Amerine tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cBillion-dollar weapons programs look silly in the face of Ukraine\u2019s ingenuity. The lesson I take away is the constant reminder that we can do things much more cheaply and elegantly with significant cost savings.\u201d</p><p>He also observed that while the U.S. military has developed a \u201crobust short-range air defense capability,\u201d it still lacks \u201can extensive and inexpensive counter-drone system\u201d that can be deployed at scale.</p><p>\u201cLegacy platforms like the aging Avenger can be upgraded to help plug some of the gaps,\u201d Amerine continued. \u201cBut the long-term solution lies in funding experimental laser weapons and spectrum dominance systems. With enough investment, lasers and jamming tech could provide a cost-effective way to neutralize small drones before they strike.\u201d</p><p>Peterson, however, contends that it was the \u201cskills of Ukraine\u2019s drone operators that made the operation a success \u2014 along with tradecraft, covert logistics, and a host of other operational achievements that had nothing to do with technology.\u201d</p><p>In any case, <em>Operation Spider\u2019s Web</em> marked a critical moment in modern warfare, revealing how low-cost, commercially available drones can deliver devastating blows to even the most fortified military assets.</p><p>The assault exposed how vulnerable even the most advanced militaries are to cheap, small, and easily concealed weapons. Dozens of AI-enabled drones were launched from within Russian territory, damaging or destroying a significant number of nuclear-capable bombers. These aircraft had been central to Russia\u2019s ability to fire long-range, hard-to-intercept cruise missiles\u2014now, that capability is diminished.</p><p>Rather than high-end equipment, the attack relied on ingenuity, autonomy, and scale-transforming commercial-grade drones into strategic weapons.</p><p>\u201cAbove all, America\u2019s military leaders need to understand that you cannot have air superiority, supremacy, or dominance without also controlling the so-called air littoral \u2014 the low altitude airspace at which small drones operate,\u201d Peterson explained. \u201cWe need a layered approach, pairing traditional air defense systems with new technologies purpose-built to detect and destroy small drones. And this included both kinetic and directed energy systems.\u201d</p><p>Yet Schake is \u201cnot convinced yet that it revolutionizes warfare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt signals that small, cheap, disposable drones are a genuine threat to expensive, exquisite platforms,\u201d she added. \u201cIt makes restoring mobility on the battlefield a real challenge, and it imposes cost-exchange ratios unfavorable to expensive platforms, but it\u2019s not a substitute for taking and holding territory.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

    "title": "CIA's Latest Existential Challenge",
    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/cia-s-latest-existential-challenge",
    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION --</strong> Today, the Central Intelligence Agency faces a crisis of trust. While CIA officers have long confronted adversaries abroad, the Agency now finds itself navigating an increasingly politicized relationship with the American public it serves.</p><p>A dangerous perception has taken root in recent years, namely that the CIA, intended to be apolitical by design, has become a partisan actor in our polarized national politics. If left unaddressed, this perception threatens not only the Agency\u2019s effectiveness but, by extension, the country\u2019s broader national security. Reflecting on my 34-year career in intelligence and nearly a decade beyond it, I recognize that such existential challenges, though rare, are not unprecedented. And there are ways to recover.</p><p>In the more than four decades since I first took the oath of office as a new CIA operations officer, I cannot recall a time when CIA was not confronted with daunting challenges. From the Cold War through the 1990\u2019s when we dealt with what then-Director James Woolsey called \u201ca jungle full of a number of poisonous snakes,\u201d to the post-9/11 war against jihadi terror and the reappearance of peer competitors, there was never a time when the Agency was not called upon to provide crucial intelligence on, and sometimes to directly confront, our nation\u2019s adversaries. I imagine those serving today face similarly formidable tasks: from countering China\u2019s rise, dealing with Russian irredentism and Iranian-inspired terrorism, to integrating <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/to-counter-china-reform-u-s-intelligence-for-the-digital-age\" target=\"_self\">cutting-edge AI</a> across the breadth of Agency operations, and rebuilding the service\u2019s human intelligence arm after the severe damage wrought by the \u2018reorganization\u2019 of 2015.</p><p>I can, however, recall only a few times when the Agency\u2019s existence was existentially challenged. The Church Committee and \u2018Time of Troubles\u2019 of the mid-1970\u2019s, were before my time. But I served during the interregnum of the 1990\u2019s, when some misguided souls thought we had reached the end of history and that, with the demise of the \u2018Evil Empire,\u2019 the nation no longer needed an intelligence service. I was also there in the post-9/11 era when the Agency was assigned disproportionate blame for that murderous assault on our nation. The professionalism and effectiveness of CIA officers in carrying out the Agency\u2019s mission were ultimately proof against those efforts to dismantle the organization.</p><p>Today, as I look at CIA from afar, it seems to me yet again to be under existential threat because many of the citizens the Agency serves have come to see it as an adversary. In truth, there has always been a particular tension in the juxtaposition between the secret world in which Agency officers live and the values of the democracy they serve. Even Presidents have sometimes voiced discomfort with the nature of the CIA\u2019s mission. President Harry S. Truman judged that \u201csecrecy and a free, democratic government don\u2019t mix.\u201d John F. Kennedy thought that \u201cthe very word secrecy\u2019 is repugnant in a free and open society.\u201d Those views are reflective of the uneasiness of the American people with the secret world and with actions seen or portrayed as less than honorable that are undertaken in their name. Former CIA Director Richard Helms addressed this inherent friction between secrecy and democracy when he wrote that \u201cthe nation must take it to a degree on faith that we, too, are honorable men dedicated to their service.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>What national security news are you missing today? Get full access to your own national security daily brief by upgrading to<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\"> Subscriber+Member</a> status.</strong> </em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>There were rare moments when the Agency enjoyed popularity. I will never forget watching the cheering crowd in front of the White House hailing CIA and the U.S. military in the wake of our delivery of justice to Osama Bin Laden. But, for the most part, the American people seemed in accord with the reluctant toleration of the Agency\u2019s activities expressed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower when he pronounced intelligence \u201ca distasteful but vital necessity.\u201d They seemingly understood that CIA has an incredibly difficult job, and that, consequently, its officers must \u2013 as John le Carre wrote in <em>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</em> \u2013 sometimes \u201cdo disagreeable things so that ordinary people here and elsewhere can sleep safely in their beds at night.\u201d</p><p>Public opinion surveys show confidence in the CIA has experienced fluctuations over time, marked by periods of erosion and recovery. Such shifting views of CIA are understandable given its role. An assertion by the Agency\u2019s first Director, Allen Dulles, that an issue under discussion in his time was \u201ca policy matter and not my job\u2019 notwithstanding, CIA has often found itself at the center of policy debates.</p><p>I can recall seemingly innumerable instances over the course of my career when the Agency, invariably hindered by its secret nature in defending itself, was used as a political football in all too often internecine arguments.</p><p>Of late, however, public confidence in the CIA has eroded significantly compared to previous decades. While most Americans still view the Agency as vital to national security, there are persistent and growing concerns about civil liberties, partisanship, and transparency.</p><p>Partisan polarization is a particular concern as trust in the CIA is increasingly shaped by political affiliation. Support among Democrats grew during the Biden administration, while Republican support declined. Moreover, Americans are more likely to judge the CIA\u2019s performance based on their alignment with the sitting president. Given the dictates of our democratic system, that perception of <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/402464/government-agency-ratings-cia-fbi-federal-reserve-down.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">political bias</a> portends serious problems not only for CIA\u2019s mission-effectiveness, but potentially for its very existence, if not addressed. </p><p>In order to do so, it is necessary to ask how that perception took hold. How did CIA which, by definition, must be an apolitical organization, come to be tarred with a partisan brush? Some will see it is a natural outgrowth of the deep divisions that characterize our nation\u2019s politics today. There is, sadly, a lot of truth in this. However, it must also be admitted that the actions of some who have an abiding love for the organization they serve, or served in, helped widen those rifts. They include, in the first instance, any CIA officers who, in the wake of the 2016 Presidential election, violated the law and their oaths to the Constitution by joining in what could only be described as a tsunami of leaks of classified or politically sensitive information as part of an attempt to \u2018resist\u2019 a President elected to office by a majority of American voters. </p><p>Further, one need only listen to half the country to understand that those serving and former officers who explicitly or implicitly cited their CIA affiliation \u2013 thereby implicitly indicating access to information unknown to the average citizen - in support of political causes contributed greatly to that perception of partisanship. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Subscriber+Members have exclusive access to the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">Open Source Collection Daily Brief</a>, keeping you up to date on global events impacting national security. It pays to be a <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\">Subscriber+Member</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Specific instances of this include lending support to the legitimacy of the since conclusively discredited \u201cSteele Dossier\u201d and, particularly, signing the open letter characterizing the \u2018Hunter Biden laptop\u2019 as having the hallmarks of a Russian information operation. Whatever personal views individual officers might hold on these and other politically contentious issues, there can be no doubt that many of our countrymen \u2013 not to mention many senior government officials - view the public statements of former CIA officers as the Agency putting its thumb on the political scale.</p><p>The organization has made clear this is not the case. But, as Henry Kissinger said, \u201cit is not a matter of what is true that counts, but a matter of what is perceived to be true.\u201d The question now is what CIA and Agency officers, past and present, can do to change that perception. A few steps come to mind.</p><p>First, CIA needs to reinforce its efforts to identify leakers and bring them to justice. As the Snowden case demonstrated, given the nature of modern technology and the speed with which information can be propagated, there is no difference in terms of the negative impact of their actions on U.S. national security between those who leak information and those spying for a foreign power. </p><p>Second, the time when former Director William J. Casey\u2019s expressed desire for a \u201cno-profile agency\u201d having long passed, CIA should re-double its public outreach efforts. Such programs will not, of course, quash the many conspiracy theories out there ranging from the serious (i.e., that CIA somehow had a hand in the JFK assassination) to the ridiculous (e.g., disproving the presence of the remains of space aliens being stored in the basement of the Original Headquarters Building). But the judicious release of historical information and the like does help educate the American people on what the Agency does in their name. </p><p>Finally, the Agency should remind former officers that they have life-long secrecy obligations but also reinforce the message that they remain representatives of CIA even after leaving the service in the eyes of their countrymen who, for the most part, do not distinguish between past and present Agency officers. Consequently, invoking their Agency experience in support of any endeavor that is clearly politically partisan can only damage the organization they served and make the already difficult jobs of those still serving harder still. And those are consequences to which no one who had the privilege and honor of serving at CIA wants to contribute.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><em>All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the US Government.

    "link": "https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-floods-oral-histories",
    "description": "<p class=\"byline\">\n                by <a class=\"name\" href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/logan-jaffe\">Logan Jaffe</a>                </p>\n                                          \n  \n\n\n\n                    \n<p>In late September 2000, longtime Kerr County, Texas, resident W. Thornton Secor Jr. sat down with an oral historian to <a href=\"https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth636788/\">tell his story</a>. Like many of the residents recorded as part of a decadeslong effort by the Kerr County Historical Commission to document the community\u2019s history, Secor had a lot to say about the area\u2019s floods. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt always seems to happen at night too,\u201d Secor said of local floods he and his family had experienced. \u201cCan\u2019t see most of it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Secor, who died in 2022, was a third-generation manager of a lodge that still operates along the Guadalupe River. His oral history shares family memories of floods going back to 1932 \u2014 like the time a flood that year washed away most of the cabins his grandfather built. </p>\n\n<p>Now, Secor\u2019s daughter, Mandi Secor Lipscomb, is left considering the future of the lodge in the aftermath of another devastating flood, on July 4. Secor Lipscomb is the fourth-generation owner and operator of the same lodge, <a href=\"https://www.waltonialodges.com/\">Waltonia on the River</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Often when I try to understand a place or process a big news event, I look for records kept by local historical societies and libraries. In archived documents, preserved photographs and oral history collections, one can start to see how a community understands itself. So, as news reports about the floods in the Central Texas Hill Country poured in throughout the week, I went looking for historical context. What local knowledge is held by people who live, or have lived, in what\u2019s repeatedly described as \u201cFlash Flood Alley\u201d? How have people in Kerr County\u2019s past contended with floods of their own time? </p>\n\n<p>A trove of more than 70 oral histories <a href=\"https://www.co.kerr.tx.us/historical/oralhistories.html\">recorded by the Kerr County Historical Commission</a> begins to answer those questions. The recordings document memories of floods going back to 1900, but oral histories alone rarely tell a full or accurate story. Still, there\u2019s at least one conclusion to draw: Everything has a history. The flood that killed more than 100 people in the Kerr County area this month <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/central-texas-hill-country-flooding-history/\">is not the first time</a> a flash flood on the Guadalupe River took lives of people, including children.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            The front page of a local newspaper, the Kerrville Daily Times, on July 20, 1987. A flash flood killed 10 campers as they tried to evacuate.\n    \n            (Kerrville Daily Times via Newspapers.com)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>I keep this history in mind when I hear local and state officials say no one could have seen this coming. Take <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLsbgiaSrg5/\">this exchange</a> between a reporter and Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reporter:</strong> Why weren\u2019t these camps evacuated?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> I can\u2019t answer that. I don\u2019t know.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reporter:</strong> Well you\u2019re the judge. I mean you\u2019re the top official here in this county. Why can\u2019t you answer that? There are kids missing. These camps were in harm\u2019s way. We knew this flood was coming.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> We didn\u2019t know this flood was coming. Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming. We have floods all the time. This is the most dangerous river valley in the United States. And we deal with floods on a regular basis. When it rains, we get water. We had no reason to believe that this was gonna be anything like what\u2019s happened here. None whatsoever. </p>\n\n<p>My colleague Jennifer Berry Hawes wrote last week about the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-flooding-evacuations-hurricane-helene\">uncanny similarities</a> between the Texas floods and Hurricane Helene, which struck North Carolina last year. In both disasters, weather forecasts predicted the potential devastation, yet people were left in harm\u2019s way.  </p>\n\n<p>And as another colleague, ProPublica editor Abrahm Lustgarten, pointed out in a piece about how <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-flash-flood-camp-mystic-climate-change-trump-noaa-fema\">climate change is making disasters like the flood in Texas more common</a>, \u201cthere will be tireless \u2014 and warranted \u2014 analysis of who is to blame for this heart-wrenching loss\u201d in the weeks to come.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShould Kerr County, where most of the deaths occurred, have installed warning sirens along that stretch of the waterway, and why were children allowed to sleep in an area prone to high-velocity flash flooding?\u201d Lustgarten wrote. \u201cWhy were urgent updates apparently only conveyed by cellphone and online in a rural area with limited connectivity?\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>As we wait for answers \u2014 or as journalists dig for them \u2014 the oral histories show Kerr County residents have warned one another, as well as newcomers and out-of-towners, about flooding for a long time. In his 2000 oral history, Secor said he remembered a time in the spring of 1959 when his father tried to warn one new-to-town woman about building a house so close to the river. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe took her out and showed her the watermarks on the trees in front of our house and all,\u201d Secor said, likely referring to the watermarks from the flood of 1932, which a local newspaper described at the time as \u201cthe most disastrous flood that ever swept the upper Guadalupe Valley.\u201d The flood killed at least <a href=\"https://climatexas.tamu.edu/products/severe-weather-summaries/1930s-texas-severe-weather\">seven people</a>. </p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 she says, \u2018that will never happen again,\u2019\u201d Secor recalled. </p>\n\n<p>He said her body was found in a tree a few months later after a flood swept her and the roof she stood on away. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to surprise newcomers when we get another flood like the \u201932 flood,\u201d Secor said in 2000.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get us again someday.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>As the Guadalupe River rose over the July 4 weekend, the 16-cabin lodge his daughter owns was sold out and full of guests. All of them escaped the floods, said Secor Lipscomb. They ran, some barefoot in the mud, up a steep hill beyond the property\u2019s retaining wall. They took shelter in a barn. </p>\n\n<p>Later, Secor Lipscomb assessed the damage to her family property. What she saw left her in tears: Four cabins had water up to the ceiling. Another two had flooded about 5 feet. But among the wreckage was a crew of nearly 40 volunteers, ready to help with the cleanup.</p>\n\n<p>By the time I reached out to her to ask her about her father\u2019s oral history, six cabins and the main camp office were already demolished. </p>\n\n<p>The cabin her great-grandfather and grandfather built together more than 100 years ago still stood. But it won\u2019t for much longer. It is so damaged with water that it, too, will have to go. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is our family history, our family legacy,\u201d Secor Lipscomb told me. \u201cOf course we\u2019re going to rebuild.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When they do, their customers will be ready. Many of the families who survived the flood already told her they\u2019ll be first in line to book for the next available July 4.</p>\n        \n                       \n                \n            Correction\n            <p><strong>July 21, 2025:</strong> This story originally misstated the death toll in the Kerr County area. The flood killed more than 100 people there, not more than 130.</p>",

This was an \u201cunattended\u201d death: one where no doctor could attest to a medical reason for the person\u2019s demise. That made it the coroner\u2019s job to determine how and why she died.</p>\n\n<p>Strong, a stocky man with white hair and bushy eyebrows, explained that he and his wife lived in an RV park on the edge of the woods nearby. He said his wife had been bedridden for years with Parkinson\u2019s disease. That morning she\u2019d woken up and asked for peanut butter and water, Strong told the deputy. He found her dead some time later.</p>\n\n<p>The coroner looked over Betty Strong\u2019s body. It was thin and frail. He didn\u2019t see a reason to suspect anything other than a natural death for this 75-year-old woman. The sheriff\u2019s deputy seemed to be satisfied with the explanation too. So, the coroner ruled that Betty Strong died around 8:40 a.m. on Dec. 14, 2016, from complications of Parkinson\u2019s, and he signed off on allowing cremation of her body.</p>\n\n<p>Less than five years later, Clayton Strong\u2019s next wife turned up dead, too: shot in the chest in Texas.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that both marriages had a history of domestic unrest, with visits from police who documented threats to each woman\u2019s safety.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s impossible to know whether a different approach to investigating Betty Strong\u2019s death would have uncovered foul play. What is certain is that clues and evidence in the case were lost forever \u2014 and Idaho\u2019s system for death investigation let it happen.</p>\n\n<p>Family members of both women believe a more thorough investigation of the death in Idaho might have saved the life of Clayton Strong\u2019s next wife in Texas.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSomeone shows up with a dead body and just says they died of natural causes,\u201d said Amy Belanger, one of Betty Strong\u2019s children. \u201cI mean, really, do you just take their word for it?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The answer is no, according to five of six national death investigation experts ProPublica consulted. They said the coroner should have obtained medical records to confirm Betty Strong was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s, examined the trailer where her husband said she died, or both.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can think of all sorts of scenarios \u2014 criminal, accidental or natural \u2014 that could have occurred there,\u201d said Jennifer Snippen, a death investigator, educator and consultant in Oregon. \u201cBut my argument is, if you don\u2019t go to the scene and you don\u2019t look at the medical records, you just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Most of the county coroners in Idaho are part-time elected officials with tiny budgets and no oversight or state funding to support their work. The national experts said that kind of system is more prone to cursory investigations like the one into Betty Strong\u2019s death.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/idaho-coroner-law-failed-reform\">failure to reform death investigations in Idaho</a> has <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/idaho-coroner-reform-timeline\">raised alarms for more than 70 years</a>, according to current and former Idaho coroners and previous ProPublica reporting.</p>\n\n<p>A national magazine called Idaho \u201cthe best place in the nation for a criminal to \u2018get away with murder\u2019 in the literal sense\u201d because of the state\u2019s \u201cantiquated county coroner\u2019s system,\u201d the Idaho Statesman newspaper reported in 1951.</p>\n\n<p>Asked whether murderers have escaped prosecution in Idaho\u2019s coroner system, Rich Riffle, coroner for the county that includes Boise, said, \u201cMy humble opinion? Yes.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>That almost happened in 2019 when one inexperienced Idaho coroner decided to take the word of Chad Daybell that his wife, Tammy Daybell, had died in her sleep after chronic health problems, vomiting and a cough. Her body was later exhumed after his next wife\u2019s children went missing. An autopsy by the Utah medical examiner\u2019s office found what medical records would have shown, had the Idaho coroner requested them: Tammy Daybell was healthy. A jury convicted Chad Daybell of murdering her by asphyxiation and of killing his next wife\u2019s two youngest children. The case is under appeal.</p>\n\n<p>At trial, coroner Brenda Dye said she had regrets. Her voice shaking, Dye told the court she would have ordered an autopsy if she\u2019d known better, but \u201cat that time, with my limited training and being new, I did the best I could.\u201d She declined ProPublica\u2019s interview request, citing <a href=\"https://www.ksl.com/article/50799068/idaho-coroner-discusses-case-thats-still-giving-her-nightmares-and-why-1st-year-was-worst-ever\">the case\u2019s effect on her mental health</a>.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            The community set up a memorial to two children who Chad Daybell was convicted of murdering; he was also convicted of killing his previous wife Tammy. The coroner originally believed Chad Daybell when he said that Tammy had died in her sleep.\n    \n            (John Roark/Post Register via AP)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Idaho isn\u2019t the only place where death investigations fall short. Because there is no uniform federal system, the rigor with which your death is investigated depends on where you die. Other states lack enough forensic pathologists to do autopsies. And many local systems like Idaho County\u2019s are squeezed for money.</p>\n\n<p>But even among its short-staffed, underfunded peers, Idaho stands out. One measure is the state\u2019s autopsy rate: third-lowest for autopsies in all deaths, last in the nation for autopsies in known cases of homicide.</p>\n\n<p>Gov. Brad Little said in January that he would support more state resources to help Idaho\u2019s coroners do their jobs. But he never got the chance; coroner-related bills passed by the Idaho Legislature this year contained no funding or other assistance for coroners and death investigations.</p>\n\n<p>So for now, each of Idaho\u2019s 44 coroners will bear costs that other states help cover: driving a body hundreds of miles to an autopsy; paying for some of those autopsies; or trying to recruit one more person to join Idaho\u2019s statewide forensic pathology workforce of three.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t care enough about how death investigations are done in your jurisdiction to invest in the people doing it, to provide them with the resources or to have high enough standards for the people that you hire to do this, you\u2019re going to get what you get, what you accept,\u201d said Snippen. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get what you allow to happen.\u201d</p>\n\nFlorida, 2010-2015\n<p>Betty Brock was a mother of seven who enjoyed singing and art, long bicycle rides, organizing family photos and researching her ancestry.</p>\n\n<p>She was caring for her terminally ill husband in 2010 when Clayton Strong befriended her on the internet, according to Belanger, her daughter. Strong claimed to be \u201cbasically destitute and living in his car,\u201d a backstory that appealed to a woman with a soft spot for taking in \u201cwounded people\u201d and trying to heal them with love, Belanger said.</p>\n\n<p>Strong drove hundreds of miles from Southwest Florida and showed up at the Brocks\u2019 property in the Florida panhandle. They agreed he could sleep in his car there as long as he helped with caregiving and housework. Soon he was sleeping in an outbuilding on the property, then in the house.</p>\n\n<p>Betty\u2019s children were puzzled as this newcomer became a fixture in their mother\u2019s life. They wanted to give Strong a chance, but they soon grew suspicious.</p>\n\n<p>Betty Brock\u2019s husband died in August 2010. By January, she was Betty Strong.</p>\n\n<p>After their courthouse marriage, Clayton Strong used their now-shared funds to buy a Ford truck and an Airstream trailer and took his bride on the road, Belanger said. The couple visited national parks that Betty had always wanted to see. They camped and hiked their way across the continent. They bought mining claims and panned for gold in the remote Idaho wilderness.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Betty and Clayton Strong. Betty\u2019s children say Clayton isolated her, threatened them when they tried to visit her, kept her from seeing her doctor, then took her to Idaho, where she died.\n    \n            (Courtesy of Amy Belanger)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>After that honeymoon, the walls around Betty Strong grew impenetrable, her children said. According to what two of her children told ProPublica and to statements two others made to police, Clayton became the gatekeeper of all communication with their mother, and he padlocked the doors of their Florida home and held the key.</p>\n\n<p>The last time Betty Strong saw her primary care doctor in Florida was in May 2013, according to records her son obtained after the death. Before that, she hadn\u2019t been in since 2010, the year Clayton Strong entered her life. The notes from the 2013 checkup show health issues common in older adults but no Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis, and neither Parkinson\u2019s nor other neurodegenerative diseases were listed in the family history section.</p>\n\n<p>The children watched from afar as the marriage devolved over the next two years. Between January 2014 and February 2015, police went to the couple\u2019s residence for welfare checks and domestic disturbances at least six times, according to police reports that Belanger provided to ProPublica. </p>\n\n<p>Her children told police that Clayton Strong threatened to shoot them if they set foot on the property, threatened to hurt their mother if they didn\u2019t back off, and prevented her from seeing a doctor.</p>\n\n<p>In the first of those police visits, in January 2014, the records show that Belanger\u2019s sister, who lived nearby, called the sheriff while standing outside the Strong residence, a brown house surrounded by oak trees and pines on a winding country road. A deputy arrived to find Belanger\u2019s sister and Clayton Strong in a stalemate, then talked to everyone outside, according to a sheriff\u2019s office report. The deputy then watched as Betty Strong turned to her husband to \u201cask him for permission\u201d to hug her daughter, and Clayton Strong \u201cremoved a set of keys from his pocket and unlocked the porch entrance gate so Betty could go in the yard\u201d for the hug.</p>\n\n<p>The report says the deputy made a referral to Florida Department of Children and Families, the agency that investigates possible abuse of vulnerable adults, and that the department opened a case.</p>\n\n<p>A similar scene played out when one of Betty Strong\u2019s sons went to the house to check on her in February 2015. For two years, Clayton Strong turned the son away when he tried to visit, and this time Strong \u201cthreatened to shoot him with a gun if he did not leave,\u201d the son told a sheriff\u2019s deputy. Clayton Strong denied that, the deputy\u2019s report says.</p>\n\n<p>The deputy found Betty Strong alone on a bed in an RV parked behind the home, the report says. She said she had Parkinson\u2019s disease and couldn\u2019t get around well. Clayton wasn\u2019t holding her against her will, she told the deputy, but she couldn\u2019t take care of herself without him.</p>\n\n<p>She had a walkie-talkie. The deputy asked: Is Clayton using that radio and telling you what to say? Betty answered \u201cno\u201d while nodding her head \u201cyes.\u201d It was a chilly afternoon, and the deputy noticed Betty had a blanket but no heater. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cBetty\u2019s demeanor, living conditions, and the controlling behavior by Clayton\u201d warranted a referral to the Florida Department of Children and Families, the deputy wrote.</p>\n\n<p>Asked for the outcome of that referral, a spokesperson told ProPublica the department investigates \u201call allegations of abuse, neglect, or exploitation\u201d but that records of those investigations are confidential under state law.</p>\n\n<p>Days after the referral in February 2015, police were again dispatched to the Florida home. This time, it wasn\u2019t one of Betty Strong\u2019s children who called; it was someone from adult protective services in need of police backup. According to the dispatch log, the worker said Clayton Strong \u201chas threatened before to pull a gun on her and is very anti-law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The couple left town a month later. Betty Strong\u2019s children never heard from her again.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Betty Strong early in her relationship with Clayton Strong. Within a few years of this trip, Clayton told authorities she\u2019d died of Parkinson\u2019s, but her children say she never had the disease.\n    \n            (Courtesy of Amy Belanger)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \nIdaho, December 2016\n<p>By the time Betty Strong died in Idaho County in December 2016, she hadn\u2019t been seen in Florida in 21 months.</p>\n\n<p>Idaho County\u2019s elected coroner, Cody Funke, had been in the job about as long.</p>\n\n<p>He knew the county well. Its vast forests, mountains and meadows stretch across more land than Massachusetts. Rugged and remote, it attracts people who want to be left alone and who distrust both government and conventional medicine. </p>\n\n<p>Funke, pronounced \u201cfunk,\u201d was in his late 20s in 2014 when he learned his part-time job at a funeral home was being eliminated. His boss asked: Had he considered running for coroner? The coroner at the time was retiring and urged Funke to do it. So did Funke\u2019s boss from his other part-time job, as an EMT. What sealed the deal for Funke: As coroner, he would get health insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Funke started the job with a feeling of \u201cgood luck, godspeed, you\u2019re gonna need it.\u201d There was no apprenticeship or ride-along to watch seasoned pros, like he\u2019d gotten when he trained to be an EMT. There was a training conference he attended in Las Vegas before taking office, and Funke received more than double the 24 hours of coroner education required by Idaho law. Even so, he isn\u2019t sure it was enough to prepare him. </p>\n\n<p>Funke learned on his first day that he wasn\u2019t getting a vehicle to move bodies from a death scene. If the local funeral home\u2019s vehicle was occupied, Funke had to use his family truck. A year after Betty Strong\u2019s death, the county commission got the coroner a vehicle: a pickup truck the sheriff\u2019s office didn\u2019t need anymore.</p>\n\n<p>The office he inherited also had no camera, and the county hadn\u2019t budgeted to give him one. He\u2019d have to use his phone to take pictures of bodies and death scenes.</p>\n\n<p>There was no morgue.</p>\n\n<p>The Idaho County coroner\u2019s office didn\u2019t even have an actual office.</p>\n\n<p>Funke\u2019s predecessors kept their files on paper, at home, he learned. The previous coroner\u2019s house had flooded, so when Funke took over, all that remained fit in two manila folders.</p>\n\n<p>The coroner\u2019s entire budget this year is $85,651. By comparison, coroner\u2019s offices serving small populations had an average budget of $280,000 in 2018, according to a national study.</p>\n\n<p>Paid $13,000 a year, Funke is on call 24 hours a day and, last year, investigated and ruled on 71 deaths, about one every five days. Papers on an additional 102 deaths of people under a doctor\u2019s care came through needing his signature for cremation.</p>\n\n<p>Funke does the coroner work on top of a full-time job. When a call comes in during business hours, he dips out to go to a death scene. If someone dies at dinnertime, he might not see his family until morning.</p>\n\n<p>He must decide with each death what the circumstances require: a simple phone call; an all-out investigation with autopsy, witness interviews, tissue samples and more; or something in the middle.</p>\n\n<p>To examine a death scene, Funke might have to drive three hours or longer each way. Whenever he orders an autopsy, Funke or his deputies have to take the body to the nearest autopsy center, a trip that takes a full day and usually demands an overnight stay. His current budget can cover 10 autopsies a year.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Cody Funke, the Idaho County coroner, also worked full time as a city wastewater treatment operator. He now works for the state prison system while remaining the coroner.\n    \n            (Liesbeth Powers for ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In those first years as coroner, Funke often leaned on police.</p>\n\n<p>Funke found it strange that Clayton Strong had loaded his wife\u2019s body into their SUV and driven to the hospital. Most people call 911 to report a death and wait for help to arrive, Funke said. But Strong offered an explanation that seemed to satisfy the sheriff\u2019s deputy: He didn\u2019t know many people in town and wasn\u2019t sure what to do.</p>\n\n<p>Strong had said his wife hadn\u2019t seen a doctor because she stuck to homeopathic remedies. That\u2019s not unusual for Funke to hear. </p>\n\n<p>The widower gave Funke the impression a coroner and sheriff\u2019s deputy wouldn\u2019t be welcome inside the trailer where she died. That\u2019s not so outside the norm for Idaho County either, Funke said.</p>\n\n<p>Betty Strong\u2019s death looked like an easy call. So Funke helped move her body to a cot to be taken from the hospital to a local funeral home.</p>\n\n<p>According to a later report from the sheriff\u2019s office, Clayton Strong showed up at the funeral home that day, said he wanted her cremated and paid $2,310 in cash. The way Funke heard it from a funeral home employee a few days later, Strong paid in $100 bills out of a lunch box.</p>\n\n<p>The detail struck Funke as peculiar. But he let it go.</p>\n\nFlorida, 2017\n<p>The couple\u2019s Airstream trailer showed up one day in January 2017, parked outside their house in Florida. A neighbor called Amy Belanger with the news, and she dispatched her brother, Daniel, who lived nearby. They\u2019d spent almost two years fearing the worst.</p>\n\n<p>The only person at the house was Clayton Strong.</p>\n\n<p>The family\u2019s matriarch had died a few weeks ago in Harpster, Idaho, Strong said. Then he told his son-in-law to get off the property.</p>\n\n<p>Amy Belanger started making calls the next day. One of the first people she reached was Funke, the county coroner. She was perplexed, she said. Why hadn\u2019t anyone called her or her siblings? Why didn\u2019t he question whether Betty Strong had actually succumbed to a disease or if something else had killed her? Belanger told Funke about the history of police calls in Florida and concerns about their mother\u2019s safety.</p>\n\n<p>Funke thought back to what he\u2019d heard from the funeral home. A lunch box of cash for a cremation? That image never sat quite right. Now he had solid ground for suspicion. Funke told Belanger he\u2019d talk to the county prosecutor and see what could be done. </p>\n\n<p>The prosecutor and the sheriff\u2019s office initially told Belanger they had opened a homicide investigation, according to a detailed timeline she created at the time. But the death scene \u2014 the Strongs\u2019 trailer \u2014 was long gone, the body cremated. The sheriff\u2019s investigator and prosecutor ultimately didn\u2019t seem to think there was enough evidence for a homicide investigation, Funke told ProPublica. </p>\n\n<p>(The prosecutor and sheriff\u2019s investigator did not return phone calls, emails or certified letters from ProPublica requesting comment on their decisions following Betty Strong\u2019s death.)</p>\n\n<p>Notes from Belanger\u2019s timeline quote a Florida detective saying he was sorry the death had occurred outside his jurisdiction. He explained to her that \u201cin Florida, deputies would have had the medical examiner\u2019s office verify medical records and take a blood sample.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The year Betty Strong died, 20% of natural deaths investigated by a medical examiner in the part of Florida where she had lived underwent autopsies before the examiner decided the cause of death was natural. About 65% of all deaths taken in by Florida\u2019s medical examiner that year were autopsied. Both numbers dwarf Idaho\u2019s coroner autopsy rates.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just Florida. Many states have more sophisticated systems for investigating deaths than Idaho\u2019s. In much of the country, centralized state medical examiner offices oversee all death investigations or provide a backstop to elected coroners in each county. </p>\n\n<p>Idaho\u2019s rural neighbor Montana has a hybrid system of medical examiners and coroners, supported by a <a href=\"https://nij.ojp.gov/program/national-center-forensics/creating-coroner-liaison-position\">coroner liaison</a> who works with death investigators to make the process more consistent statewide. And next door in Wyoming, a state board sets <a href=\"https://post.wyo.gov/board-of-coroners/post-coroner-rules\">rules for coroners to follow</a>. The rules spell out what each death investigation should include: scene investigation, toxicology sample, DNA sample, photographs, external examination of the body and an inventory of property, evidence and medications.</p>\n\n<p>Jennifer Snippen, the death investigator in Oregon, was one of the experts who drafted the National Institute of Justice\u2019s 2024 death-scene investigation guidebook.</p>\n\n<p>She said death investigations are more likely to be thorough when states and counties give their investigators enough funding and education, \u201cso that they have the motivation and the ability to get to as many scenes, and get as much information about every single death, as possible.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Those who study the work of coroners and medical examiners in the U.S. have learned that the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/gone-without-a-case-suspicious-elder-deaths-rarely-investigated\">deaths of elderly people are especially likely to be written off as age-related</a>, without considering whether the person may have also been a victim of abuse or neglect.</p>\n\n<p>Snippen\u2019s <a href=\"https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/m900p302v\">research in 2023</a> is one of the most recent studies to confirm that. She reviewed data from thousands of cases. The person least likely to get a scene investigation or autopsy? An elderly woman who dies at home.</p>\n\n<p>Lauri McGivern, a nationally recognized expert in death investigations, said national standards would have Funke verify Betty Strong\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis and ask more questions of Clayton Strong as the sole caregiver of a vulnerable adult. McGivern, who coordinates medicolegal death investigations in Vermont, reviewed the facts that Funke was given at the time of Betty Strong\u2019s death and his subsequent report at ProPublica\u2019s request.</p>\n\n<p>To follow national standards, McGivern said, Funke also would have gone to the Airstream trailer or asked law enforcement to examine the death scene and report back to him.</p>\n\n<p>But McGivern and other experts said they understand why Funke didn\u2019t follow those national guidelines \u2014 because they\u2019ve seen it happen so many times in places like rural Idaho.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing what he was shown how to do,\u201d McGivern said. \u201cAnd probably doing the best he can, with no budget and no support and no education.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            When Funke took over from Idaho County\u2019s previous coroner in 2015, there was no equipment. Over the years, Funke had to get county commissioners to approve purchases like a radio to take coroner calls.\n    \n            (Liesbeth Powers for ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Frustrated by how little Idaho officials knew and why they hadn\u2019t dug further into her mother\u2019s death, Amy Belanger channeled her grief into trying to find answers on her own.</p>\n\n<p>She followed a trail of public records left by Clayton Strong. Had he harmed other women? Had he been in a relationship with anybody who went missing? \u201cI was looking into his past to see if there was a pattern like that,\u201d Belanger said. Something she could share with officials in Idaho.</p>\n\n<p>Then she stumbled across a document: a recent marriage license.</p>\n\n<p>Three months after depositing Betty Strong\u2019s body at a hospital in Idaho, Clayton Strong wed a woman from Texas.</p>\n\n<p>Belanger needed to warn her.</p>\n\nTexas, 2017-2021\n<p>Shirley Weatherley had a lot in common with Betty Strong. She was a mother and grandmother. She\u2019d been married before. She lived in a small, modest home on a large piece of land in a rural locale, where she\u2019d been caring for a terminally ill former spouse when Strong contacted her on Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>They\u2019d known each other as teenagers in Lubbock. Their reconnection after he arrived at her house in Weatherford, a suburb of Fort Worth, eventually began to worry her children.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe isolated her,\u201d said\u00a0Jamie Barrington, Weatherley\u2019s son with a previous husband. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let grandkids, my brother \u2014 anybody\u2019d come over, he just kept them at arm\u2019s length.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Shirley Weatherley\n    \n            (Courtesy of Jamie Barrington)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Barrington said he and other members of Weatherley\u2019s family had suspicions about Strong. Then they connected with Belanger and heard what happened in Florida and Idaho.</p>\n\n<p>Belanger urged the family to tell their mother everything they\u2019d heard. She \u201cactually was pleading with us to watch out,\u201d Barrington recalled. </p>\n\n<p>Knowing another family was worried helped fuel Amy Belanger\u2019s quest for the truth about her mother\u2019s death. Her siblings chipped in to help Belanger rent a van and drive across the country in search of clues \u2014 anything that could shed light on her mother\u2019s death.</p>\n\n<p>Once she got to Idaho, Belanger spent more than a week investigating. She met with the coroner and sheriff. She went to the mining claims the Strongs had purchased. She stayed at the RV park where Betty Strong died and interviewed the people who\u2019d owned it in 2016; they remembered talking to each other about how \u201chinky\u201d the death and Clayton Strong\u2019s reaction to it seemed.</p>\n\n<p>Back in Texas, Weatherley\u2019s family tried to warn her. </p>\n\n<p>When they relayed the story about Betty Strong to her, Weatherley chalked it up to a grieving family trying to cope with loss by grasping for an explanation, Barrington said. After all, Strong had a death certificate that listed natural causes. </p>\n\n<p>The details Barrington later learned from family members and police about his mother\u2019s life with Strong were \u201cpretty horrific,\u201d he said. Weatherley had reported that Strong threatened to kill her, but no charges were filed. Then at one point, in the midst of an argument with Strong, Weatherley lobbed the accusations about Betty Strong\u2019s death at him, Barrington said. Strong flew into a rage.</p>\n\n<p>Weatherley called police in July 2021. She and Strong were splitting up, and he shoved her while moving his stuff out of the house, Weatherley told the officer. Strong had \u201churt her\u201d in the past, so she called police to make sure it didn\u2019t happen again, the officer\u2019s report says. The officer got Strong\u2019s side of the story \u2014 she was \u201crunning him off,\u201d but he didn\u2019t push her \u2014 and stuck around until Strong agreed to leave.</p>\n\n<p>Police would later document finding two items in the house. The first was a copy of Weatherley\u2019s will that left everything to Strong, on which she\u2019d written \u201cVOID,\u201d the second was a digital camera hidden in their bedroom. The camera contained selfies of injuries to her face and chest and a video of Strong putting his arm around her neck as she screamed for help.</p>\n\n<p>Strong persuaded Weatherley to let him back into their home once more on Aug. 4, 2021, according to police records.</p>\n\n<p>Four days later, Weatherley\u2019s son and grandson found her body wrapped in a gray tarp near the front steps to her home. She\u2019d been shot in the chest. Authorities matched shell casings at the scene to an AK-47-style rifle, which security footage showed Strong ditching in a shopping cart outside a Walmart.</p>\n\n<p>Picked up later by police in Mexico, Strong died of cardiac arrest while awaiting extradition in Weatherley\u2019s killing.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Mexican police booked Clayton Strong on gun charges in 2021. After the arrest, they discovered he was a suspect in the murder of his wife in Texas.\n    \n            (Parker County Sheriff\u2019s Office via Facebook)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \nToday\n<p>Jamie Barrington, Shirley Weatherley\u2019s son, was reluctant at first to speak publicly about his mother\u2019s death in Texas, even years later. He agreed to talk with ProPublica, he said, because he wants Idaho\u2019s coroner system to improve. He said he never imagined that a death like Betty Strong\u2019s could be ruled \u201cnatural\u201d based on what a spouse told authorities.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI truly believe that if there had been a proper investigation and not taking his word for it,\u201d Barrington said, \u201cthat it probably would have made a big difference\u201d in what happened to Shirley Weatherley.</p>\n\n<p>Word of Weatherley\u2019s murder eventually reached Funke, the coroner in Idaho. He said in hindsight, Strong\u2019s actions in Idaho County seem more suspicious than they did at the time to his inexperienced eyes and ears.</p>\n\n<p>Now, after 10 years as coroner, \u201cI would have pushed a little bit harder\u201d to have an officer or deputy follow up or go to the RV park with him. He would have asked police to use a national database \u2014 one he didn\u2019t know about at the time \u2014 to find Betty Strong\u2019s family members and learn more about her background. \u201cI have trust issues after cases like this,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Funke said the story of Betty Strong\u2019s death needs to be told, even if it shows that he and Idaho County made mistakes, because it can help lawmakers understand what is wrong with the state\u2019s system.</p>\n\n<p>Idaho\u2019s coroners need more funding, he said, because right now they\u2019re an afterthought in county budgets. Most counties set a coroner salary at what amounts to less than minimum wage, so it\u2019s impossible for someone like Funke to be coroner without a second, full-time job.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese offices should be fully staffed,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we have one or two people that are here full time to answer questions and respond to these calls, versus, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve got to take time off work, boss.\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And he believes new coroners who lack experience should be required to learn how to work a case from start to finish before they\u2019re called out to a death like Betty Strong\u2019s.</p>\n\n<p>Daniel Belanger, one of Betty Strong\u2019s children, came away from his interactions with Idaho County officials convinced that the only way deaths like his mother\u2019s will be properly investigated is through legislation forcing coroners and law enforcement agencies to change their approaches.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey completely dropped the ball,\u201d he told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>Amy Belanger said her family has reclaimed very few of her mother\u2019s possessions from the Airstream trailer. Strong emptied the Florida house of family heirlooms after their mother\u2019s death, Belanger said. Most of the family photo albums her mother toiled over are gone.</p>\n\n<p>The brown house on the winding road in Florida is still there. Belanger\u2019s memories of family cookouts and holiday gatherings linger in the house; they weren\u2019t wiped away by the police visits and padlocked doors. But the family home isn\u2019t the family\u2019s anymore. Years later, it is stuck in legal limbo \u2014 the deed still in the name of Clayton Strong and Shirley Weatherley, the woman he married after the death of Betty Strong.</p>",

Additionally, the Defense Department requires that people handling sensitive data be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. </p>\n\n<p>This presented an issue for Microsoft, which relies on a vast global workforce with significant operations in India, China and the European Union.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                        \n    \n        Microsoft established its low-profile \u201cdigital escort\u201d program to get around this prohibition.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Microsoft\u2019s foreign workforce is not permitted to access sensitive cloud systems directly, so the tech giant hired U.S.-based \u201cdigital escorts,\u201d who had security clearances that authorized them to access sensitive information, to take direction from the overseas experts. The engineers might briefly describe the job to be completed \u2014 for instance, updating a firewall, installing an update to fix a bug or reviewing logs to troubleshoot a problem. Then the escort copies and pastes the engineer\u2019s commands into the federal cloud.</p>\n\n<p>The problem, ProPublica found, is that digital escorts don\u2019t necessarily have the advanced technical expertise needed to spot problems.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trusting that what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t malicious, but we really can\u2019t tell,\u201d said one current escort.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        The escorts handle data that, if leaked, would have \u201ccatastrophic\u201d effects.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Microsoft uses the escort system to handle the government\u2019s most sensitive information that falls below \u201cclassified.\u201d According to the government, this includes \u201cdata that involves the protection of life and financial ruin.\u201d The \u201closs of confidentiality, integrity, or availability\u201d of this information \u201ccould be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect\u201d on operations, assets and individuals, the government has said.</p>\n\n<p>Defense Department data in this category includes materials that directly support military operations.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                        \n    \n        The program could expose Pentagon data to cyberattacks.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Because the U.S.-based escorts are taking direction from foreign engineers, including those based in China, the nation\u2019s greatest cyber adversary, it is possible that an escort could unwittingly insert malicious code into the Defense Department\u2019s computer systems.</p>\n\n<p>A former Microsoft engineer who worked on the system acknowledged this possibility. \u201cIf someone ran a script called \u2018fix_servers.sh\u2019 but it actually did something malicious, then [escorts] would have no idea,\u201d the engineer, Matthew Erickson, told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>Pradeep Nair, a former Microsoft vice president who said he helped develop the concept from the start, said a variety of safeguards including audit logs, the digital trail of system activity, could alert Microsoft or the government to potential problems. \u201cBecause these controls are stringent, residual risk is minimal,\u201d Nair said.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        Digital escorts present a natural opportunity for spies, experts say.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cIf I were an operative, I would look at that as an avenue for extremely valuable access. We need to be very concerned about that,\u201d said Harry Coker, who was a senior executive at the CIA and the National Security Agency. Coker, who also was national cyber director during the Biden administration, added that he and his former intelligence colleagues \u201cwould love to have had access like that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Chinese laws allow government officials there to collect data \u201cas long as they\u2019re doing something that they\u2019ve deemed legitimate,\u201d said Jeremy Daum, senior research fellow at the Paul Tsai China Center at Yale Law School. Microsoft\u2019s China-based tech support for the U.S. government presents an opening for Chinese espionage, \u201cwhether it be putting someone who\u2019s already an intelligence professional into one of those jobs, or going to the people who are in the jobs and pumping them for information,\u201d Daum said. \u201cIt would be difficult for any Chinese citizen or company to meaningfully resist a direct request from security forces or law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                        \n    \n        Microsoft says the program is government-approved.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In a statement, Microsoft said that its personnel and contractors operate in a manner \u201cconsistent with US Government requirements and processes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The company\u2019s global workers \u201chave no direct access to customer data or customer systems,\u201d the statement said. Escorts \u201cwith the appropriate clearances and training provide direct support. These personnel are provided specific training on protecting sensitive data, preventing harm, and use of the specific commands/controls within the environment.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Insight Global \u2014 a contractor that provides digital escorts to Microsoft \u2014 said it \u201cevaluates the technical capabilities of each resource throughout the interview process to ensure they possess the technical skills required\u201d for the job and provides training.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        Microsoft says it disclosed details of the escort program to the government. Former Pentagon officials said they\u2019d never heard of it.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Microsoft told ProPublica that it described the escort model in documents submitted to the government as part of cloud vendor authorization processes. Former defense and intelligence officials said in interviews that they had never heard of digital escorts. Even the Defense Department\u2019s IT agency didn\u2019t know about it until reached for comment by ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI probably should have known about this,\u201d said John Sherman, who was chief information officer for the Defense Department during the Biden administration. He said the system is a major security risk for the department and called for a \u201cthorough review by [the Defense Information Systems Agency], Cyber Command and other stakeholders that are involved in this.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>DISA said, \u201cExperts under escort supervision have no direct, hands-on access to government systems; but rather offer guidance and recommendations to authorized administrators who perform tasks.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                        \n    \n        There were warnings early on about the risks.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Multiple people raised concerns about the escort strategy over the years, including while it was still in development. A former Microsoft employee, who was involved in the company\u2019s cybersecurity strategy, told an executive they opposed the concept, viewing it as too risky from a security perspective. </p>\n\n<p>Around 2016, Microsoft engaged contacts from Lockheed Martin to hire escorts. The project manager says they told their counterpart at Microsoft they were concerned the escorts would not have the \u201cright eyes\u201d for the job given the relatively low pay.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft did not respond to questions about these points.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        Other cloud providers wouldn\u2019t say if they also use escorts.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>It\u2019s unclear whether other major cloud service providers to the federal government also use digital escorts in tech support. Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud declined to comment on the record for this article. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with his Chinese counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, at the ASEAN Summit. Rubio described the exchange as \u201cconstructive\u201d and hinted at a possible upcoming meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. China described the exchange as \u201cconstructive and pragmatic.\u201d</p><p>This exchange followed the comments of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, at the Shangri-La Dialogues in Singapore on May 31, 2025: \u201cAny attempt by China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world.\u201d Despite these words of caution, in mid-June 2025 and in preceding months, China deployed fighter jets, naval vessels and drones around Taiwan in air-sea joint training exercises meant to intimidate Taipei.</p><p>China\u2019s recent actions in the Yellow Sea, to include incursions into South Korean territorial waters and airspace, are also of concern. This comes at a time when China continues to claim all of the South China Sea as their own, despite a United Nations Tribunal\u2019s 2016 ruling that China\u2019s claims to the South China Sea, based on its \u201cnine dash line\u201d map, were not legally valid.</p><p>There is considerable concern that China will use its military to invade or blockade Taiwan by 2027, when China supposedly would have the military might to attempt unification by force. That would be a grave mistake.</p><p>The U.S. \u2013 China relationship is tense, with some predicting an eventual war, despite $582.4 billion in total trade with China in 2024, $126.9 billion of U.S. foreign direct investment in China and over 277,000 Chinese students studying in the U.S. China\u2019s actions in the South China, East China and Yellow Seas and their attempted military intimidation of Taiwan all contribute to this tense relationship.</p><p><strong>The U.S. was there for China</strong></p><p>The U.S. was there for China when Deng Xiaoping reached out to the U.S. in 1979, after normalization of relations, and established a strategic relationship with the U.S. that contributed to the defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, the end of the Cold War in 1991 and joint U.S. \u2013 China cooperation on counter terrorism, counter nuclear proliferation, counter narcotics and joint efforts to counter international organized crime. And there were over 300,000 Chinese students studying in the U.S. with significant U.S. investment in China, which contributed to providing China with Most Favored Nation status in 2000, a move that exponentially expanded bilateral trade.</p><p>And it was the U.S. that got China into the World Trade Organization in December 2001. Indeed, China\u2019s membership in WTO favorably impacted China\u2019s economic development; it was a catalyst for China\u2019s economic growth and modernization.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

The willingness of these two superpowers to work jointly on these global problems, as we did in the 1980s and 1990s, would be welcomed by all countries, except for the Russian Federation and Iran.</p><p>The recent meeting of Marco Rubio and Wang Yi and hopefully the eventual meeting of Presidents Xi and Trump could be the beginning of a relationship that not only deals with the tension in the bilateral relationship but also deals with the common good both nations could do if we worked together on a myriad of socio-economic and geopolitical challenges confronting the global community. Moving in this would require bold and sustained leadership, reminiscent of the 1980s and 1990s. </p><p><strong><em>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in </em></strong><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/14/china-improve-relations-us/\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Times</a></em></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</em></strong></p>",

De Mello did not respond to requests for comment, and the administration did not address questions sent by ProPublica about his departure.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Government Efficiency began pushing the IRS to provide taxpayer data to immigration agents soon after President Donald Trump took office. The tax agency\u2019s acting general counsel refused and was replaced by De Mello, who Trump administration officials viewed as more willing to carry out the president\u2019s agenda. Soon after, the Department of Homeland Security, ICE\u2019s parent agency, and the IRS negotiated a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d that included specific legal guardrails to safeguard taxpayers\u2019 private information.</p>\n\n<p>In his email, De Mello said ICE\u2019s request for millions of records did not meet those requirements, which include having a written assurance that each taxpayer whose address is being sought was under active criminal investigation.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s just no way ICE has 7 million real criminal investigations, that\u2019s a fantasy,\u201d said a former senior IRS official who had been advising the agency on this issue. The demands from the DHS were \u201cunprecedented,\u201d the official added, saying the agency was pressing the IRS to do what amounted to \u201ca big data dump.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In the past, when law enforcement sought IRS data to support its investigations, agencies would give the IRS the full legal name of the target, an address on file and an explanation of why the information was relevant to a criminal inquiry. Such requests rarely involved more than a dozen people at a time, former IRS officials said.</p>\n\n<p>Danny Werfel, IRS commissioner during the Biden administration, said the privacy laws allowing federal investigators to obtain taxpayer data have never \u201cbeen read to open the door to the sharing of thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of tax records for a broad-based enforcement initiative.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for the White House said the planned use of IRS data was legal and a means of fulfilling Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to carry out mass deportations of \u201cillegal criminal aliens.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Taxpayer data is among the most confidential in the federal government and is protected by strict privacy laws, which have historically limited its transfer to law enforcement and other government agencies. Unauthorized disclosure of taxpayer return information is a felony that can carry a penalty of up to five years in prison.</p>\n\n<p>The system that the IRS is now creating would give ICE automated access to home addresses en masse, limiting the ability of IRS officials to consider the legality of transfers. IRS insiders who reviewed a copy of the blueprint said it could result in immigration agents raiding wrong or outdated addresses.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf this program is implemented in its current form, it\u2019s extremely likely that incorrect addresses will be given to DHS and individuals will be wrongly targeted,\u201d said an IRS engineer who examined the blueprints and who, like other officials, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute that ended in De Mello\u2019s ouster was the culmination of months of pressure on the IRS to turn over massive amounts of data in ways that would redefine the relationship between the agency and law enforcement and reduce taxpayers\u2019 privacy, records and interviews show.</p>\n\n<p>In one meeting in late March between senior IRS and DHS officials, a top ICE official made a suggestion: Why doesn\u2019t Homeland Security simply provide the name and state of its targets and have the IRS return the addresses of everyone who matches that criteria?</p>\n\n<p>The IRS lawyers were stunned. They feared they could face criminal liability if they handed over the addresses of individuals who were not under a criminal investigation. The conversation and news of deeper collaboration with ICE so disturbed career staff that it led to a series of departures in late March and early April across the IRS\u2019 legal, IT and privacy offices.</p>\n\n<p>They were \u201cpushing the boundaries of the law,\u201d one official said. \u201cEveryone at IRS felt the same way.\u201d</p>\n\nThe Blueprint\n<p>The technical blueprint obtained by ProPublica shows that engineers at the agency are preparing to give DHS what it wants: a system that enables massive automated data sharing. The goal is to launch the new system before the end of July, two people familiar with the matter said.</p>\n\n<p>The DHS effort to obtain IRS data comes as top immigration enforcement leaders face escalating White House pressure to deport some 3,000 people per day, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ices-tactics-draw-criticism-it-triples-daily-arrest-targets-2025-06-10/\">according to reports</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One federal agent tasked with assisting ICE on deportations said recent operations have been hamstrung by outdated addresses. Better information could dramatically speed up arrests. \u201cSome of the leads that they were giving us were old,\u201d said the agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the press. \u201cThey\u2019re like from two administrations ago.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In early March, immigrants rights groups <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278147/gov.uscourts.dcd.278147.1.0.pdf\">sued the IRS</a> hoping to block the plan, arguing that the memorandum of understanding between DHS and the IRS is illegal. But a judge in early May <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278147/gov.uscourts.dcd.278147.67.0.pdf\">ruled against them</a>, saying the broader agreement complied with Section 6103, the existing law regulating IRS data sharing. That opened the door for engineers to begin building the system.</p>\n\n<p>The judge did not address the technical blueprint, which didn\u2019t exist at the time of the ruling. But the case is pending, which means the new system could still come under legal review.</p>\n\n<p>Until now, little was known about the push and pull between the two agencies or the exact technical mechanics behind the arrangement.</p>\n\n<p>The plan has been shrouded in secrecy even within the IRS, with details of its development withheld from regular communications. Several IRS engineers and lawyers have avoided working on the project out of concerns about personal legal risk.</p>\n\n<p>Asked about the new system, a spokesperson for IRS parent agency the Treasury Department said the memorandum of understanding, often called an MOU, \u201chas been litigated and determined to be a lawful application of Section 6103, which provides for information sharing by the IRS in precise circumstances associated with law enforcement requests.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>At a time when Trump is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366178/trump-deport-jail-u-s-citizens-homegrowns-el-salvador\">making threats</a> to deport not only undocumented immigrants but also U.S. citizens, the scope of information-sharing with the IRS could continue to grow, according to documents reviewed by ProPublica and sources familiar with the matter: DHS has been looking for ways to expand the agreement that could allow Homeland Security officials to seek IRS data on Americans being investigated for various crimes.</p>\n\n<p>Last month, an ICE attorney proposed updating the MOU to authorize new data requests on people \u201cassociated with criminal activities which may include United States citizens or lawful permanent residents,\u201d according to a document seen by ProPublica. The status of this proposal is unclear. De Mello, at the time, rejected it and called for senior Treasury Department leadership to personally sign off on such a significant change.</p>\n\n<p>The White House described DHS\u2019 work with the IRS as a good-faith effort to identify and deport those who are living in the country illegally.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cProPublica continues to degrade their already terrible reputation by suggesting we should turn a blind eye to criminal illegal aliens present in the United States for the sake of trying to collect tax payments from them,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement after receiving questions about the blueprint from ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>She pointed to the April MOU as giving the government the authority to create the new system and added, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a surveillance system. \u2026 It\u2019s part of President Trump\u2019s promise to carry out the mass deportation of criminal illegal aliens \u2014 the promise that the American people elected him on and he is committed to fulfilling.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In a separate statement, a senior DHS official also cited the court\u2019s approval of the MOU, saying that it \u201coutlines a process to ensure that sensitive taxpayer information is protected while allowing law enforcement to effectively pursue criminal violations.\u201d</p>\n\nHow the System Works\n<p>The new system would represent a sea change, allowing law enforcement to request enormous swaths of confidential data in bulk through an automated, computerized process.</p>\n\n<p>The system, according to the blueprint and interviews with IRS engineers, would work like this:</p>\n\n<p>First, DHS would send the IRS a spreadsheet containing the names and previous addresses of the people it\u2019s targeting. The request would include the date of a final removal order, a relevant criminal statute ICE is using to investigate the individual, and the tax period for which information is sought. If DHS fails to include any of this information, the system would reject the request.</p>\n\n<p>The system then attempts to match the information provided by the DHS to a specific taxpayer identification number, which is the primary method by which the IRS identifies an individual in its databases.</p>\n\n<p>If the system makes a match, it accesses the individual\u2019s associated tax file and pulls the address listed during the most recent tax period. Then the system would produce a new spreadsheet enriched with taxpayer data that contains DHS\u2019 targets\u2019 last known addresses. The spreadsheet would include a record of names rejected for lack of required information and names for which it could not make a match.</p>\n\n<p>Tax and privacy experts say they worry about how such a powerful yet crude platform could make dangerous mistakes. Because the search starts with a name instead of a taxpayer identification number, it risks returning the address of an innocent person with the same name as or a similar address to that of one of ICE\u2019s targets. The proposed system assumes the data provided by DHS is accurate and that each targeted individual is the subject of a valid criminal investigation. In effect, the IRS has no way to independently check the bases of these requests, experts told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the blueprint does not limit the amount of data that can be transferred or how often DHS can request it. The system could easily be expanded to acquire all the information the IRS holds on taxpayers, said technical experts and IRS engineers who reviewed the documents. By shifting a single parameter, the program could return more information than just a target\u2019s address, said an engineer familiar with the plan, including employer and familial relationships.</p>\n\n<p>Engineers based at IRS offices in Lanham, Maryland, and Dallas are developing the blueprint.</p>\n\n\u201cGone Back on Its Word\u201d\n<p>For decades, the American government has encouraged everyone who makes an income in the U.S. to pay taxes \u2014 regardless of immigration status \u2014 with an implicit promise that their information would be protected. Now that same data may be used to locate and deport noncitizens.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor years, the IRS has told immigrants that it only cares that they pay their taxes,\u201d said Nandan Joshi, an attorney with the Public Citizen Litigation Group, which is seeking to block the data-sharing agreement in federal court. \u201cBy agreeing to share taxpayer data with ICE on a mass basis, the IRS has gone back on its word.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The push to share IRS data with DHS emerged while Elon Musk\u2019s <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/elon-musk-doge-tracker/\">DOGE</a> reshaped the engineering staff of the IRS. Sam Corcos, a Silicon Valley startup founder with no government experience, pushed out more than 50 IRS engineers and restructured the agency\u2019s engineering priorities while he was the senior DOGE official at the agency. He later became chief information officer at Treasury. He has also led a separate IRS effort to create a master database using products from Silicon Valley giant Palantir Technologies, enabling the government to link and search large swaths of data.</p>\n\n<p>Corcos didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The White House said DOGE is not part of the DHS-IRS pact.</p>\n\n<p>Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance, which oversees the IRS, told ProPublica the system being built was ripe for abuse. It \u201cwould allow an outside agency unprecedented access to IRS records for reasons that have nothing to do with tax administration, opening the door to endless fishing expeditions,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the department\u2019s internal watchdog, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-doge-irs-treasury-tigta-inspector-general-probe\">is already probing efforts by Trump and DOGE</a><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-doge-irs-treasury-tigta-inspector-general-probe\"> </a>to obtain private taxpayer data and other sensitive information, ProPublica reported in April.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration continues to add government agencies to its deportation drive.</p>\n\n<p>DOGE and DHS are also working to build a national citizenship database, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/29/nx-s1-5409608/citizenship-trump-privacy-voting-database\">NPR reported last month</a>. The database links information from the Social Security Administration and the DHS, ostensibly for the purpose of allowing state and local election officials to verify U.S. citizenship.</p>\n\n<p>And in May, a senior Treasury Department official directed 250 IRS criminal investigative agents to help deportation operations, a significant shift for two agencies that historically have had separate missions.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/mac-funk\">McKenzie Funk</a> contributed reporting, and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/kirsten-berg\">Kirsten Berg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/alex-mierjeski\">Alex Mierjeski</a> contributed research.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>\u201cThe most important part right now is that Europe would be able to buy military equipment here in the U.S. so we can donate these military systems directly to Ukraine. That is also discussion going on right now. I think [President] Trump is on the right path here. I think he has promised that would be a possibility. We are talking in these hours about 10 Patriot [missile defense] systems and I think the outcome of that discussion will be that European countries will be able to buy the Patriot systems and then donate them directly to Ukraine and that's important because the discussions two months ago were, in fact, that there were no more to buy here in the U.S. So the outcome of the discussion right now is moving in a better direction.\u201d</p><p>That was Denmark\u2019s Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen, speaking one week ago at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), where he appeared along with Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, Denmark\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs. They discussed not just Ukraine and NATO, but also their relations with the U.S., Greenland, the critical minerals issue and Denmark\u2019s goals in taking over the Presidency of the European Union (EU) for the next six months.</p><p>The two had been in Washington for several days of meeting with senior Trump officials, and Members of Congress, in part because Denmark has assumed the Presidency of the European Union and plans to make military preparedness a hallmark of the country\u2019s six month leadership term.</p><p>Last Tuesday, Poulsen explained the reasoning for European nations to buy weapons from the U.S. for Ukraine, which Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte announced at the White House yesterday. He and Rasmussen also explained the background of the European nations\u2019 decision-making as well as their views of activities here in Washington and the rest of the world.</p><p>Foreign Minister Rasmussen gave his own assessment of the situation in Moscow, saying, \u201cYou shouldn't overestimate the power of Russia. I mean we have weakened the [Russian] economy. They are now on a war footing so to speak. They spend more on military than in health and education and everything civilized combined. They have huge casualties, high inflation. I mean if it was a more open transparent society with some kind of internal discussions, things would have been very, very, different. If you compare the casualties with what they lost in Afghanistan and decided to withdraw, it's much worse.\u201d</p><p>A former two-time Danish Prime Minister, Rasmussen continued, \u201cBut of course it's a closed society and it is a one-man-takes-all-decisions-kind-of-society. It's not a democracy, but it is within our hands, so to speak, to actually crash Putin and his war machine.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen then added, \u201cThe big question is whether we [Denmark and the other NATO and EU countries] have, you know, the readiness, the willingness to do so, and here of course we need the U.S. I mean it goes without saying that Europe has to pay a bigger part of the bill. We do. We [Europe] now account for like 70% of the total support to Ukraine. That number will go up, but we need the U.S. on board as well, not least when we are talking sanctions and pressure on Putin.\u201d</p><p>As Rasmussen pointed out, tiny Denmark supplies quite a bit by itself. \u201cWe are the fourth biggest contributor to Ukraine,\u201d he said, \u201cso it's like U.S., U.K. [United Kingdom], Germany, and then Denmark. Per capita, we are so far the biggest. We spend like plus 1,500 Euros [$1,754] per capita in Denmark. It's more than the double compared to the second biggest spender in Europe.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

So that's my main objective to be here [in Washington].\u201d</p><p>Poulsen added, \u201cTrump is quite much aware of that. And also [Defense Secretary] Pete Hegseth and [Secretary of State] Mario Rubio [both of whom they had met with]. They are aware that they have to speed up all these processes \u2014 too much red tape in delivering to Europe. And when we are coming to U.S. saying we would like to buy even more military equipment, then I don't think the answer should be you have to wait seven or eight years to get it.\u201d</p><p>Poulsen also said, \u201cEurope will do more and I think the outcome of the situation in Ukraine is also the demanding question for Europe to be able to invest more and also build up more [military] capacity,\u201d which he described as among the \u201clessons learned from Ukraine.\u201d</p><p>At one point Rasmussen said he had met briefly with Trump during the June NATO meeting at The Hague. \u201cI told him when we met last time when I was prime minister, we only spent like 1.5 percent [of the nation\u2019s GDP] in Denmark [for our defense spending]\u2026Then the whole thing happened in Ukraine. Now there's totally new sense of urgency. This year Denmark spends 3.2 percent, exactly the same as U.S. It is a clear commitment from our government that we will meet the 3.5 percent [NATO goal by 2035].\u201d</p><p>Ukraine has shown itself to be very strong in creating new and innovative defense companies, they both said, but investment in arms manufacturing outside Ukraine is what they talked about. Rasmussen said, \u201cBasically it's about buying from Ukraine to Ukraine.\u201d </p><p><span></span>He described that when the war started Ukraine had a weapons industry of some $3 billion, but it is now up to $40 billion, although Ukrainians \u201conly have finance for half of it.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen said an answer has been that \u201cwe [the Danes] have spent our own money and we also have the honor to be the facilitator of some of these [Russian] frozen assets or the interest linked to the frozen asset. So that is the basis of the Danish model and now we are working on making, you know, real investments\u2026with our Ukrainian friends to set up Ukrainian investments in Denmark to give them some kind of safe haven.\u201d</p><p>Other European countries have followed, and together with the Ukrainians they are producing arms not just for Ukraine, but for their own militaries. \u201cWe should be inspired of what the Ukrainians lesson learned from their battlefield,\u201d Rasmussen said, \u201cand that's why it makes sense also to invest not only to assist them [Ukrainians], but also to make some kind of technology transferring from Ukraine to our own military.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><em>Sign up today</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Poulsen said the first pilot project was last July, when Denmark paid for 18 Bohdana self-propelled 155 mm howitzers that Ukraine had created on its own. \u201cThey were produced in two months,\u201d Poulsen said. \u201cShould we have been able to buy them in Europe, it will have taken two years. So in two months they were able to produce the Bohdana systems. It was very cheap and the spare parts, the maintenance, all that kind of thing are, of course, being done directly near the front line. So it has been a huge success and right now we're looking into also developing new capabilities or finance new capabilities for the defense companies in Ukraine. That would be missiles, that would be drones. It's under Ukrainian defense demands that they ask for this and we reimburse [pay for] the contracts.\u201d</p><p>With some $20 billion from Europeans and others available, Poulsen explained, \u201cthe best way we can do for our friends in Ukraine to keep up fighting is in fact to give money directly into the [Ukraine] defense companies.\u201d</p><p>Poulsen called it Danish model 2.0. and said, \u201cThat's to invite some of the [Ukraine] defense companies to have a safe haven in Denmark to produce what they will need in Ukraine, hopefully all also in Germany and other European countries.\u201d</p><p>Poulsen also described a new approach involving Denmark, Germany and Nordic countries \u2014 jointly buying weapons systems.</p><p>As an example, Poulsen said that Denmark, Norway and Sweden are looking into buying the P-8A Poseidon U.S. Navy multi-mission maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft. He said it was a capability they already have in Norway and Germany, but \u201cnot buying it ourselves [individually]\u2026we'll also have some capabilities that we could use together with Sweden and Norway\u2026So that will be the way forward.\u201d</p><p>As for Greenland, Rasmussen said he did not really discuss the matter in any depth when he met with Rubio because \u201cwe [the Danes] have the slogan \u2018nothing about Greenland without Greenland [being present].\u2019 Even though the foreign security policy [of Greenland] is, you know, the Danish government's responsibility, we have developed a good tradition or custom that if we are, you know, really negotiating with the third countries about these issues we will have our Greenlandic colleague [with us].\u201d</p><p>Greenland, he said, was discussed \u201cin a more generally way.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen said the Danes were \u201ctaken by surprise\u201d by Trump\u2019s announcement that for both U.S. national security and international security it was necessary that Washington annex Greenland.</p><p>Rasmussen, who was Danish Prime Minister from 2016-to-2019 during Trump\u2019s first term, said, \u201cI have experienced with Trump so many times that whatever he says\u2026and whatever he proposes there's always some kind of rational substance behind it. I mean, and we share the view, that we have to be present in the Arctic in a different way. But it shouldn't be in a fight between the kingdom of Denmark and U.S. It should be by combining forces and we have the framework for that.\u201d</p><p>He explained that the Danes \u201chave been pushing for including [the] Arctic in the capability targets in NATO. And, to some extent, we were successful. There's now a kind of principal agreement among the NATO Arctic countries, including U.S., that this is something we should do under the framework of the NATO.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen added, \u201cSo it's not that the Greenlandic issue is solved. I think because apart from these rational arguments, I can't get rid of the idea that there's also just this [Trump] vision of creating a bigger U.S. and we can, of course, not accommodate that.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen added, \u201cI must say I leave Washington a bit more optimistic compared to when I arrived. I think the statement made by the president [Trump] after his [most recent] telephone conversations with [Russian President] Putin and [Ukraine President] Zelensky prove that he now to a larger extent share our analysis of the situation. I mean it was a bit confusing earlier this year when he had Zelensky in the Oval Office who is the bad guy, who is the good guy. That has shifted. I think the [Hague] NATO summit was also important. I mean I really feel and think he [Trump] has perhaps the most positive view on Europe he has had for a while, at least.\u201d</p><p>All that has turned out to have been realistic. Let\u2019s hope Trump stays on his current trajectory.</p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>Today, after a post-9/11 era defined by global counterterrorism and asymmetric warfare, the U.S. is preparing for potential near-peer conflicts amid an era of great power competition that is complicated by disruptive technologies. In response, a new wave of defense contractors is emerging from the epicenter of American technological innovation: Silicon Valley. These companies are addressing critical technology gaps in areas such as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, space services, cyber operations, and small drones. They're deploying cutting-edge solutions to fill capability shortfalls that the U.S. government has acknowledged exist\u2014and they\u2019re scaling fast. Winning high-profile contracts, these companies are reshaping how the Pentagon engages with the private sector.</p><p>Among those in the defense tech industry, there\u2019s been growing chatter about the rise of these defense disruptors\u2014what you might call the <em><em>neoprimes</em></em>. We\u2014one of us a technology investor, the other a former portfolio manager at the Department of Defense\u2019s Defense Innovation Unit\u2014are often asked:<em><em> Is the rise of neoprimes real? What exactly is a neoprime? What defines one? </em></em>We set out to answer those questions, using data to support our observations. We believe neoprimes are changing the culture of defense acquisitions and developing technologies that will reshape how wars are fought. Shifts in defense spending and policy are empowering neoprimes to grow and move faster.</p><p>To understand how we got here, we can revisit a pivotal 1993 meeting now known as the \u201cLast Supper.\u201d Following the end of the Cold War, U.S. defense spending plummeted, prompting a major drawdown. The Department of Defense faced intense pressure to cut costs, with budgets falling by about 30%\u2014from, adjusted for inflation, $772 billion in 1989 to roughly $531 billion by 1998. Against this backdrop, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense William Perry convened a critical meeting, the \u201cLast Supper,\u201d with executives from the top defense contractors. His message was clear: the Pentagon could no longer sustain a sprawling ecosystem of dozens of major firms, and consolidation was inevitable. The industry responded accordingly\u2014over 50 companies merged into the five dominant primes we know today. These survivors\u2014Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics\u2014became massive, vertically integrated organizations that controlled roughly 60% of Department of Defense contracts by 2000. For decades, these primes dominated government contract spending to build and sustain the nation's security apparatus, supported by a vast web of partners and subcontractors. But with predictable, annual funding streams and limited competitive pressure, innovation within these primes arguably stagnated.</p><p><span></span>While many of these traditional primes trace their roots back over a century, a new tribe of Silicon Valley players has entered the arena. They are accelerating deployment timelines and pioneering a different model\u2014defined by rapid iteration, software-first architectures, and a greater appetite for risk. They're deploying operational systems in months rather than years or decades. They\u2019re not just building prototypes for demos and exercises\u2014they\u2019re scaling production and securing billion-dollar contracts. While they may not yet match the traditional primes in total contract volume, they are closing the gap year over year. A handful of key firms are leading the charge, with an expanding set of startups gaining traction. Backed by venture capital and supported by a growing network of influential advocates shaping policy and public opinion, neoprimes are starting to redefine how the government approaches the acquisition, fielding, and sustainment of new technologies. They are becoming mission-critical to the defense industrial base of America.</p><p>As this new generation of defense contractors gains momentum, what exactly is a neoprime? To answer that, we analyzed data from USAspending.gov (the federal government\u2019s official platform for tracking public expenditures), reviewed SEC filings from public defense companies, and compiled press releases from private firms. We also interviewed founders and venture capitalists focused on national security innovation.</p><p>Through this research, we identified several defining characteristics of neoprimes and emerging market trends. Our analysis focuses on a set of current neoprimes\u2014SpaceX, Palantir, and Anduril Industries\u2014alongside a cohort of rising companies like Shield AI, Skydio, Saildrone, Saronic, Hidden Level, Epirus, Relativity Space, Axiom Space, HawkEye 360, Vannevar Labs, and others. These companies are beginning to lead major defense programs with advanced technologies and a fundamentally different approach to speed, software integration, and delivery.</p><p>Below, we outline our findings and define the characteristics that distinguish neoprimes. We believe these companies represent the future of national security\u2014and to preserve America\u2019s strategic edge, we must rapidly adopt and scale their solutions across the defense industrial base.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Join us in Sea Island, Georgia for The Cipher Brief's </em><a href=\"https://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em>2025 Threat Conference</em></u></a><em> from October 19-22. See how you can save your seat at </em><a href=\"https://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em>tcbconference.com</em></u></a></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>Neoprimes are Racing Ahead in Department of Defense's Critical Technology Areas</strong></p><p>At their core, neoprimes are built around emerging, frontier technologies\u2014fields like AI and autonomy, integrated networks, biotechnology, and quantum science. In recent years, the Department of Defense has formally emphasized the importance of these technologies, identifying fourteen Critical Technology Areas that reflect a growing urgency to catch up with and surpass global competitors. </p><p>To better understand this trend, we evaluated the top five most commonly used Product Service Codes (PSCs) for a set of government contractors from 2018 to 2023. PSCs are used by the U.S. federal government to describe the products, services, and research being purchased through contracts, and we gathered this data from USAspending.gov\u2019s contract award summaries by vendor. For Palantir, SpaceX, and Anduril, we then identified the most popular PSCs across all three. We performed the same analysis to determine the top PSCs among the traditional defense primes\u2014Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics. </p><p>Palantir's top PSCs were predominantly in the information technology category, consistent with their core strength in data platforms and software integration. Most of the PSCs associated with Anduril were concentrated in engineering services. </p><p>In contrast, for traditional primes such as General Dynamics, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon, the most common PSCs were heavily concentrated in hardware categories\u2014covering items like airframe structural components, helicopter rotor blades, and shock absorbers. Compared to newer entrants, their portfolios featured far fewer PSCs related to software or IT services.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fa6d7\" src=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.png?id=61219053&amp;width=980\" /> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Neoprimes are also focused on interoperability. Traditional contractors are notorious for proprietary systems that require their own unique control systems and limited third-party integrations\u2014like drones that can only be operated with specific controllers, computers, or field kits. But proprietary everything doesn't scale on a battlefield increasingly filled with robots, sensors, and drones, especially as soldiers are limited by the number of control systems they can carry into the field. In contrast, neoprimes are designing software with interoperability in mind from the start\u2014built to integrate seamlessly with legacy systems and ingest any data the government allows.</p><p>Overall, the solutions neoprimes are developing are especially relevant today, as many Cold War-era tools are failing to scale to the demands of the modern battlefield. For example, Ukrainian soldiers are now using low-cost drones to disable expensive Russian platforms\u2014in the recent Spider's Web operation, 117 drones struck four Russian military airbases and targeted at least 40 warplanes. The operation dealt a significant asymmetric blow to the Russian military and broader economy, with estimated losses reaching up to $7 billion. The inevitable shift toward more affordable, more attritable platforms is forcing governments to rethink how they develop and fund major defense systems. Neoprimes and the Department of Defense are racing to develop low cost-to-kill technologies\u2014while also developing defenses against them\u2014as these small lethal platforms become increasingly common on modern battlefields around the world.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Sign up for the </strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>Cyber Initiatives Group</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

We have observed that these companies don't necessarily wait for the Department of Defense to fund their R&amp;D instead, they develop solutions they believe are obvious answers to current pressing problems and find ways to get them into the hands of warfighters\u2014often well before any large procurement orders have even been placed. </p><p>These companies will send prototypes \"downrange\" with willing servicemembers, sometimes years before more formal procurement contracts materialize. Shield AI, for example, deployed working prototypes of their AI-enabled drones to Special Operations Forces in combat in the Middle East, gaining critical feedback while also delivering real-world results for those early adopters. Other companies have taken similar approaches: deliver cutting-edge technology to warfighters first\u2014even before any formal requirement exists\u2014refine it in the field, and let the bureaucracy catch up later.</p><p>While we are encouraged by these bold efforts, we also recognize that rapidly deploying cutting-edge technology is not enough. What matters most is enabling and rewarding companies that deliver measurable impact on mission outcomes and operational effectiveness. We urge the Department of Defense to prioritize this focus across both traditional primes and neoprimes.</p><p><strong>Delivering On Time and Within Budget</strong></p><p>Neoprimes often prioritize outcomes over processes. For instance, Palantir was recently awarded a $178 million contract by the U.S. Army to develop the TITAN system, beating RTX Corporation in a competitive selection process. Remarkably, Palantir delivered the project on time and within budget\u2014traditionally a rare feat in defense contracting.</p><p>As one example of neoprimes' outcome-first approach, we have observed a growing preference for fixed-price contracts over the traditional cost-plus model. Under a fixed-price structure, companies are incentivized to innovate efficiently, as they are paid a set amount regardless of overruns. This stands in stark contrast to cost-plus contracts, where incumbents are reimbursed for all expenses and earn a profit margin on top\u2014removing much of the pressure to operate leanly.</p><p>When analyzing government spending data, we observed that nearly 100% of Palantir and SpaceX's contracts are fixed-price, while 65-80% of Anduril's contracts follow the same model. Among the traditional primes, General Dynamics has steadily secured an increasing number of fixed-price contracts, and the trend is less clear for others.</p><p>That said, both neoprimes and traditional contractors continue to rely on cost-plus contracts, as they remain the prevailing norm across much of the defense industry. We also recognize that ongoing debate surrounds the use of firm fixed-price versus cost-plus models in defense procurement. While advocates of fixed-price contracts view them as the most effective way for the government to ensure value and accountability, critics argue that fixed-price models can be too risky for complex scopes of work. A common argument in favor of cost-plus is that it provides the necessary flexibility when project requirements are uncertain or evolving.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"><br /></div> <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-90\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"10d7c\" src=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.png?id=61219438&amp;width=980\" /> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong><strong>Maximizing Revenue and Contract Value per Employee</strong></strong></p><p>Neoprimes operate with small, agile teams\u2014often with just a fraction of the headcount of traditional defense contractors. But what they lack in size, they make up for in velocity and output. Many of these companies are producing higher revenue or contract value per employee.</p><p>SpaceX and Anduril have outperformed several major traditional defense contractors in terms of obligations per employee, exceeding the ratios of Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics. And while Lockheed Martin has outperformed all in absolute terms, that may be attributed to its significantly larger revenue\u2014approximately $51 billion compared to SpaceX's $3.8 billion. </p><p>Note that because Anduril and SpaceX are still private companies, we based their employee counts on estimates from public reports. Palantir and all traditional primes report employee numbers in their SEC filings.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e1a8d\" src=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.png?id=61219057&amp;width=980\" /> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>Rising Use of OTAs in Defense Contracting</strong></p><p>While Palantir, SpaceX, and Anduril are leading neoprimes, several other companies are rapidly emerging in this category. Shield AI, which began with AI-powered quadcopters for U.S. Navy SEALs and other special operations forces, is now fielding its V-BAT unmanned aerial vehicle in Ukraine, Japan, and Brazil. Companies like Saildrone and Saronic are deploying a range of autonomous drones above and below the water. Cybersecurity leaders such as Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, and Crowdstrike are becoming key players in areas like trusted networks and digital defense. Commercial space companies like Varda, HawkEye 360, and Astranis are building capabilities for on-demand space access, persistent satellite coverage, and high-speed space-based data transfer.</p><p>With the rise of neoprimes, the Department of Defense has significantly increased its use of Other Transaction Agreements (OTAs) in recent years, reflecting a strategic shift toward more agile and flexible procurement methods. OTAs, which are not bound by the traditional Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), allow the Department of Defense to collaborate more easily with nontraditional contractors, including startups and research institutions. When properly executed, we believe that OTAs can lead to better, faster, cheaper outcomes for everyone involved\u2014saving time, money, and effort.</p><p>Further analysis shows that OTA usage is clearly trending upward within the Department of Defense. Even though OTA awards have increased significantly since 2017, however, they still account for only about 0.116% of the total contracts awarded by the Department of Defense\u2014it's still far from mainstream in the broad acquisition community. Given what OTAs have already delivered, we can only imagine the impact if more contracts were accelerated this way.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ff678\" src=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.png?id=61219059&amp;width=980\" /> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>The Road Ahead: Partnering with Neoprimes to Meet Emerging National Security Needs</strong></p><p>Today, we believe the U.S. government is beginning to recognize the strategic value of neoprimes in addressing critical capability gaps. The Department of Defense has acknowledged its lag in several key technology areas and has taken deliberate steps to close the gap. In addition to encouraging the services to expand their use of OTAs, the Department of Defense introduced the Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) framework to attract non-traditional vendors. It also launched the Office of Strategic Capital to provide more flexible financing options and created the National Security Innovation Capital initiative to support dual-use hardware development. Over the past two decades, the Department of Defense has invested more than $20 billion in small business initiatives\u2014all promising signs of progress, but more work remains. </p><p>Across the country, dozens of emerging technology companies are winning contracts that would have defaulted to traditional primes just a few years ago. These startups are not simply disrupting the defense industrial base; they are actively shaping the future of warfare. Their technologies are beginning to influence military doctrine, operational planning, and frontline tactics. </p><p>This shift reflects a broader transformation in national security priorities\u2014one we strongly support and believe must be accelerated. As these threats become increasingly software- and technology-driven, we\u2019re encouraged to see Silicon Valley and its neoprimes emerge as natural leaders in enabling the next generation of military readiness. Now is the time to double down.</p><p><em><em><strong>Editor's Note: The authors of this article are affiliated with Brave Capital and MVA (MilVet Angels), which have invested in national security companies like Anduril Industries, Shield AI, Aetherflux, Hermeus, Ursa Major, and others.</strong></em></em></p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

Its military has suffered staggering losses \u2013 more than one million soldiers killed or wounded since its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Analysts say its economy is in its weakest state in three decades. And more than three years after Putin launched his \u201cspecial military operation\u201d against Ukraine, Russia appears no closer to achieving its initial war aims than it was when the first troops paratroopers dropped into Kyiv.  </p><p>All of this begs the question: Whatever Putin\u2019s ambitions, can Russia pose a credible threat to the rest of Europe?   </p><p>\u201cTo launch a large-scale conventional armed incursion into a NATO country is not something Russia would want to do today,\u201d Kurt Volker, a former U.S. Ambassador to NATO, told <em><em>The Cipher Brief.</em></em> \u201cThey are bogged down in Ukraine. Their forces are not trained and equipped and capable where they want them to be.\u201d   </p><p>General Philip Breedlove (Ret.), a Cipher Brief expert who served as Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, describes \u201ctwo realities\u201d about the Russian threat.   </p><p>\u201cThe first reality is that Russia's army is really badly mauled and beaten up right now,\u201d said Breedlove. \u201cIt certainly is not ten feet tall, like we used to think. I jokingly say it's about five-foot five these days. So, over the next several years, in a land warfare context, Europe could do just fine.\u201d </p><p>But Gen. Breedlove says the second \u201creality\u201d is that Russia will work hard to rebuild its military might, that it has allies who will help, and that it has less conventional ways to threaten Europe in the meantime.   </p><p>\u201cIn many ways, Mr. Putin's running amok out there,\u201d he said, \u201cin the hybrid war, the below-the-line fight, whatever you want to call that war.\u201d   </p><p><strong>One view: A battered, beaten-down Russia</strong> </p><p>By almost any military or economic metric, Russia is in no position today to threaten other nations in Europe. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-june-12-2025\" target=\"_blank\"><u>estimates that Russia</u></a> has suffered between 900,000 and 1.3 million casualties since the 2022 invasion \u2013 including 350,000 troops killed in action. (By comparison, in the decade-long war in Afghanistan, the Soviets suffered roughly 50,000 dead and wounded.) <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/graphic-detail/2025/07/09/russias-summer-ukraine-offensive-looks-like-its-deadliest-so-far\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><em>The Economist</em></em></u></a> estimates that in Russia\u2019s current offensive, launched on May 1<u>,</u><span></span>31,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, for only snail-like advances.   </p><p>As for the <a href=\"https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/russias-economy-could-be-headed-for-collapse/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Russian economy</u></a>, the strains are evident in a growing budget deficit, falling oil revenues, and soaring interest rates. Last week, the main lending rate stood at a record 21%.   </p><p>Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges (Ret.), who served from 2014 to 2017 as the top U.S. Army Commander in Europe, said that given these realities, he has been surprised by Russia\u2019s staying power in Ukraine.   </p><p>\u201cRussia, I was certain, would not have made it this long,\u201d Hodges told <em><em>The Cipher Brief</em></em>, \u201cgiven the casualties that they have suffered, and the effects of some of the sanctions on them.\u201d  </p><p>Volker believes Russia\u2019s weaknesses \u2013 economic and military \u2013 are as profound as they have been at any other time during Putin\u2019s quarter century in charge.   </p><p>\u201cThey have lost a third of their strategic bombers,\u201d Volker said. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost a million people off the battlefield. They\u2019re having to replenish with recently conscripted untrained forces. And they're digging into storage to get World War II era equipment.\u201d</p><p>Ambassador Doug Lute, who \u2013 like Volker \u2013 served as U.S. Ambassador to NATO, said that \u201cPutin's army, which invaded Ukraine in 2022, largely does not exist today.\u201d</p><p>Lute notes that while Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion force was the product of a decade-long modernization ordered by Putin, Ukraine has succeeded \u2013 with on-and-off help from the West \u2013 in severely degrading those forces.

With those numbers, they will be able to constitute the force size that they choose fairly quickly.\u201d  </p><p>\u201cI think General Cavoli put this very well,\u201d Liana Fix, a Senior Fellow for Europe, told <em><em>The Cipher Brief</em></em>. \u201cHe said Russia was in a very bad position, but it can reconstitute its military much faster than we might expect.\u201d That, Fix said, means that while Russia may not threaten NATO nations now, it won\u2019t be long before it does.  </p><p>\u201cIf [Russia] continues on this path of very quick reconstitution of its military with China's help, it will pose a serious threat to NATO allies,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that's what they are all concerned about.\u201d  </p><p><strong>The gray-zone threat </strong> </p><p>While it may take time for Russia\u2019s conventional military to rebuild, Moscow has been extremely effective launching operations in the gray zone, that area of operations that falls just under the threshold of war.

The Danish Defense Intelligence Service (DDIS) <a href=\"http://v/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>issued an analysis</u></a> of the Russian threat earlier this year, offering three scenarios \u2013 all of them starting with an end to the Ukraine war, and the assumption that Russia cannot currently wage war against multiple nations.   </p><p>Within six months of the guns going silent in Ukraine, the DDIS said, Russia would be able to wage a local war with a bordering country. In two years, it would have the capacity to launch a regional war in the Baltic Sea region. And within five years, it could launch a large-scale attack on Europe.  </p><p>\"Russia is likely to be more willing to use military force in a regional war against one or more European NATO countries if it perceives NATO as militarily weakened or politically divided,\" <a href=\"https://www.fe-ddis.dk/globalassets/fe/dokumenter/2025/trusselsvurderinger/-20250209_opdateret_vurdering_af_truslen_fra_rusland_mod--.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the report said</u></a>. \"This is particularly true if Russia assesses that the U.S. cannot or will not support the European NATO countries in a war with Russia.\"  </p><p>Germany\u2019s defense chief told the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62v63gl8rvo\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><em>BBC</em></em></u><u> last month</u></a> that Russia would be militarily ready to attack within four years \u2013 and perhaps sooner than that.  </p><p>\u201cIf you ask me now, is this a guarantee that's not earlier than 2029?\u201d General Carsten Breuer commented, \u201cI would say no, it's not. We must be able to fight tonight.\"   </p><p>In all these assessments, there are variables that would alter the calendar: the global price of oil \u2013 upon which Russia depends for revenue; the long-term loyalties of Russian allies, China in particular; and the mood of U.S. President Donald Trump, who is expressing frustration with Putin while offering more military aid to Ukraine.   </p><p>All those interviewed for this story made the point that robust and continued Western support for Ukraine \u2013 and sanctions against Russia \u2013 would prove critical in determining when Russia is truly able to menace other European nations.   </p><p>\u201cAll of this really turns on our credibility,\u201d Gen. Breedlove told us. \u201cI think Mr. Putin senses weakness and he knows what to do in the presence of weakness.\u201d   </p><p>Lt. Gen. Hodges said that the most important determinant of Russia\u2019s ability to threaten other nations in Europe will be how it ultimately fares in Ukraine.   </p><p>\u201cWhat I am sure of is that if Ukraine capitulates or fails, or if we turn our back on Ukraine and Russia is able then to take a couple of years to rebuild and fix what is broken, they will be knocking on the door of Moldova and on the door of Latvia or any other Baltic nation,\u201d Hodges said.   </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because their objective is to break the alliance, to show that NATO and its member nations are not really willing to fight against Russia over a piece of Estonia, for example, or a piece of Latvia. To make sure that the Russians never make that terrible miscalculation, we have to get back to where we were in the Cold War days, of spending what's necessary, of being prepared so that you can have another 40, 50 years of no war with Russia.\u201d  </p><p><em><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to </strong></em></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><em><strong>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</strong></em></em></u></a><em><em><strong> on YouTube?

    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/afghanistan-taliban-russia",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>In recent weeks, reports of Russia considering formal engagement and recognition of the Taliban have reignited debate around international approaches to the de facto rulers of Afghanistan.</p><p>But contrary to assumptions of ideological or strategic alignment, Moscow\u2019s overtures appear rooted more in fear than affinity.</p><p><strong>A Security-Driven Outreach</strong></p><p>Russia\u2019s posture toward the Taliban must be viewed through a regional security lens. In intelligence and counterterrorism circles, there is increasing alarm in Moscow over the surge in foreign extremist fighters now operating with impunity inside Afghanistan. Russia has long claimed that ISIS-K and affiliated groups enjoy covert support from Western intelligence services, a claim that is exaggerated but nonetheless fuels deep strategic paranoia within the Kremlin.</p><p>Recent intelligence reports indicate a notable uptick in foreign terrorist presence, particularly in northern and eastern provinces bordering Central Asia. Russia is concerned not just about Afghanistan\u2019s instability, but about its spillover potential into Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, all countries with fragile internal balances and historical ties to Moscow.</p><p>In this context, engagement with the Taliban is less about diplomatic recognition and more about gaining operational access, establishing surveillance footholds, and ensuring a minimal level of information-sharing. For Russia, the Taliban may be a tactical irritant, but foreign jihadist groups are a strategic threat.</p><p><strong>Taliban\u2019s Quest for Legitimacy</strong></p><p>From the Taliban\u2019s side, any engagement by major powers is quickly repackaged as de facto recognition\u2014a form of validation they desperately seek. Lacking internal legitimacy and having seized power through force, the Taliban views external recognition as a shortcut to international acceptance, regardless of the terms or the motives of the recognizing party.</p><p>Whether Russia\u2019s engagement is rooted in security fears or strategic containment is irrelevant to the Taliban; what matters is the optics. This dynamic creates a dangerous asymmetry, where tactical coordination by foreign states can be misrepresented as endorsement of Taliban governance.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Upgrade your access to exclusive content by </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\"><em>becoming a subscriber</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>The China Factor: Quiet Watchfulness</strong></p><p>Speculation has mounted that China may follow suit. However, Beijing\u2019s interests in Afghanistan remain fundamentally different from Moscow\u2019s. For China, the overriding concern is the presence of Uyghur militants \u201cEast Turkistan Islamic Movement\u201d, many of whom have historically sought refuge in Afghanistan\u2019s east.</p><p>At the same time, China\u2019s strategic posture is fixated on its global rivalry with the United States, particularly in the domains of economic dominance and technological superiority\u2014most notably in artificial intelligence. Afghanistan, in this framework, is a peripheral concern. As long as Beijing can secure its western flank through covert financial leverage, trade access, and intelligence coordination, it has little incentive to formally recognize the Taliban. Such a move would carry diplomatic costs without any meaningful strategic return.</p><p><strong>A Word of Caution for the International Community</strong></p><p>While Russia and China may justify Taliban engagement based on narrow national security imperatives, these moves carry broader strategic and ethical risks. First, they undermine the international consensus that recognition must be contingent on inclusive governance, human rights, and counterterrorism compliance. Second, such recognition risks legitimizing radicalization and authoritarian consolidation through force, potentially emboldening similar movements elsewhere.</p><p>Finally, tactical engagement by states like Russia must be carefully managed to avoid the legitimization of Taliban rule, particularly in media narratives. Intelligence-sharing or backchannel coordination is a longstanding reality in conflict zones, but it must be explicitly framed as counterterrorism containment, not state-to-state diplomacy.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em><strong>Join us in Sea Island, Georgia for The Cipher Brief's </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>2025 Threat Conference</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> from October 19-22.

Afghanistan, under Taliban control, is rapidly becoming an ungoverned space\u2014one that external powers increasingly fear more than favor.</p><p>For the United States, these developments represent a critical inflection point. As global powers move from isolation to tactical engagement with the Taliban, Washington must lead in upholding the principle that recognition should never precede reform. Any diplomatic engagement\u2014whether multilateral or bilateral\u2014must be explicitly tied to measurable outcomes: meaningful counterterrorism cooperation, the protection of civil liberties, and inclusive political participation that reflects Afghanistan\u2019s ethnic and social diversity.</p><p>In the absence of such standards, the international community risks legitimizing a regime that has shown little intent to evolve\u2014and considerable capacity to destabilize.</p><p>At the same time, the United States should take a parallel step to support the formation of a legitimate political opposition to the Taliban\u2014one that represents the hopes of Afghans for a sovereign, democratic, and inclusive future. Working in coordination with international partners, Washington can help this coalition articulate a long-term political vision for the country. Though limited in scope, such a move would send a powerful message to Afghans inside and outside the country, to regional allies and adversaries alike, and even to the Taliban: that Afghanistan\u2019s future will not be defined by force alone. Most importantly, it would empower Afghans themselves particularly the new generation to lead the struggle for their nation's destiny.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

    "description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\u201cTo each there comes in their lifetime a special moment when they are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing\u2026\u201d</em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> \u2014 Winston S. Churchill</p><p><strong>OPINION</strong> -- Winston Churchill would have recognized the current situation in the U.S. relationship with Russia as a unique opportunity to make a mark on history. </p><p>Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin reaffirmed Moscow\u2019s war intentions in Ukraine, saying he considered Russians and Ukrainians to be one people and, \u201cin that sense the whole of Ukraine is ours.\u201d In the past two weeks, Putin has intensified Russia\u2019s drone and missile attacks across Ukraine putting heavy strain on Ukrainian air defenses. The Russian president is evidently of the view that Ukraine\u2019s defenses may be on the verge of collapse and that he can achieve his war ambitions through force.</p><p>Putin has cleverly played his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, whispering intentions of ending the war through negotiation and counting on Trump\u2019s desire for peace to push Ukraine into a deal that would essentially amount to surrender. But Putin has never once deviated from his maximalist goals in the war, in fact, he has only reaffirmed them at every opportunity. Russian participation in negotiations with Ukraine were quickly proven to be a form of \u2018maskirovka\u2019 (successful operations that mislead the enemy).</p><p>Now, Putin has intensified a bombing campaign clearly designed to target civilian infrastructure with the intent of both killing and demoralizing the Ukrainian people, and undermining support for the war and for the government in Kyiv.</p><p>Trump and his team seem to have finally arrived at the realization that they have been taken for a ride by Putin. The U.S. president recently characterized discussions with the Russian leader as \u201cmeaningless,\u201d saying, \u201cWe get a lot of bullsh*t thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth.\u201d (President Trump is not known for understatement. This may be the exception.)</p><p>Following his most recent call with Putin and a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump decided to resume sending some air defense interceptors and precision-guided bombs and missiles to Ukraine after last month\u2019s halt. This is a positive development but it is not enough. </p><p>Now is the critical moment to show strength, unity, and resolve to support the people of Ukraine. The U.S. President should not let himself be distracted by any suggestion relayed by Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov to Secretary of State Rubio after the two exchanged views on new ideas for Ukraine peace talks. (Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.)</p><p>The people of Ukraine understand better than anyone, the existential nature of Putin\u2019s aggression. They see what Russia is doing by kidnapping Ukrainian children and sending them to the territory of the Russian Federation. They see the elimination of Ukrainian language instruction in schools in areas Russia occupies. They see the dreadful, starved and tortured condition of Ukrainian soldiers who are returned in prisoner exchanges. For Ukraine, surrender or conquest means extermination. To end this, more military, economic and political assistance is required.</p><p>The decision by the U.S. to participate in the recent \u201cCoalition of the Willing\u201d meeting is another step in the right direction. U.S. participation sends an important message to our allies and to Putin. Trump should immediately take other actions to send Putin and the world a clear message of support for the victim in this conflict, Ukraine. </p><p>A good first step would be to support legislation sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal that targets Russia and countries that purchase Russian hydrocarbon products with stiff sanctions. The full range of available weapons systems should also be fast-tracked for delivery to Ukraine. Restrictions on their use in targeting military installations in the territory of the Russian Federation should be immediately removed. And high priority in that target set should be the factories that produce the Shahed drones that are now being used as weapons of terror against Ukrainian civilians.</p><p>President Trump should take a big picture view of the world Putin has created and the actual state of play of the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d that Putin has built. </p><p>In December of 2024, one of the key players in the Axis, former Syrian President Basher al Assad, saw his government collapse and he fled to exile in Moscow. Since October 2023, Israel has ruthlessly dismantled favored surrogates of the Axis, including Hamas and Hezbollah. The U.S. used military force to attack another favorite surrogate of Iran, the Houthis in Yemen. And in June, Israel conducted a number of stunningly effective attacks against Iran\u2019s nuclear program, military leadership, scientists, air defenses and other important targets. </p><p>Significantly, the U.S. joined Israel in conducting attacks against nuclear targets in Iran thereby demonstrating a commitment to use powerful elements of the U.S. military against a critical member of Putin\u2019s alliance. Note that all of these actions against Putin\u2019s axis received barely a peep from the great dictator in the Kremlin, much less a military response. Putin\u2019s axis is in serious trouble.</p><p>Russia\u2019s military is fully engaged in the fight against Ukraine, leaving Moscow with very little response. Estimates suggest that Russia has suffered a million casualties (killed, wounded, captured, missing) in the conflict thus far. All for the gain of a few hundred kilometers of Ukrainian territory. </p><p>The cost to Russia\u2019s economy has been similarly catastrophic. Inside his government, the mysterious deaths and suicides of regime officials and oligarchs\u2014even some considered to be Putin supporters - has got to be sending a message to those remaining - that no one is safe. The key piece in the puzzle that could bring Putin the fate he deserves is resolve from the U.S. President. </p><p>Ukraine was given just enough support not to lose against Russia under President Joe Biden, but never enough support to actually win and end this war. President Trump, you have the opportunity to show the world that you are the winning president.</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/4202494/remarks-by-secretary-of-defense-pete-hegseth-at-the-2025-shangri-la-dialogue-in/\" target=\"_blank\">warned recently</a> that an invasion \"could be imminent\", saying at a summit in Singapore at the end of May, that \"There's no reason to sugarcoat it: the threat China poses is real.\" The Defense Secretary also said that Beijing is \"credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific,\" adding, \"to be clear: any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world.\" Hegseth is not alone in believing that a Chinese invasion is inevitable as part of President Xi Jinping\u2019s plan to \u201cre-unify\u201d the island with mainland China. But it is also just part of a much broader strategy that long-term, poses significantly higher stakes.</p><p>As a result of the threat posed to U.S. national security, the CIA established the China Mission Center in 2021, with the aim of better coordinating the collection and analysis components of intelligence to better inform U.S. policymakers \u2013 and most importantly, the Agency\u2019s number one customer \u2013 the president of the United States \u2013 with the most accurate information possible about Xi Jingping\u2019s intent and timeline. Cipher Brief Expert Susan Miller, who retired from the CIA just a few months ago - where she served as the Assistant Director at the Center - told <em>The Cipher Brief</em> that Xi\u2019s intent is not only to forcefully reunify Taiwan. In fact, that\u2019s just the beginning.</p><p><strong>THE INTERVIEW</strong></p><p><em>Cipher Brief CEO & Publisher Suzanne Kelly talked with Miller about how U.S. intelligence is working to better understand what Xi is thinking.

She also served as assistant director of several mission centers at the Agency. \n      </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong></em><em><strong>What do you think it is that the American people need to understand about why China is posing a threat to U.S. national security and how they\u2019re doing it?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>He wants to absolutely replace the U.S. as the world leader, but he doesn't want to replace us as the world leader of democracy. He wants to replace us as the world influencer. He knows that we're going to go to war someday because he absolutely plans in the coming decade, if not in the shorter term, to invade Taiwan. And he absolutely knows that we would come to the defense of democracies around the world. So, in order to give him the edge, he has - not only in America but all around the globe - been able to get into national power grids. Just think, what could you do with that capability in a time of war? You turn off the power. We know he's in power grids in America and Europe and Africa and Asia.</p><p>Why? Because companies from the People\u2019s Republic of China underbid other companies. Now that ability is gone. That's something that the previous administration and the current administration both said, \u2018<em>we're not going to let anybody get at our current infrastructure\u2019</em>. But can you imagine if we decide to go to war to support Taiwan or we have to do it because something else has happened, can you imagine having no power in California or along the Eastern seaboard? And that's why we need to really care. And Xi Jinping\u2019s plan is to take us over bit by bit. There are some things that we have kind of let go, although we shouldn't have. One of them is that he has taken over U.S. influence in Africa and other developing countries.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> </strong><strong>China has certainly used its Belt and Road Initiative to moving into these areas and they're bringing money and they're bringing infrastructure and they're making day-to-day life better for the locals \u2013 at least in the short-term.</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Yes. They're doing what we used to do with USAID and with getting U.S. companies to kind of sign up and go do this, so that we could make sure we still get important minerals and so that we can make the widgets that we need to make from all of these countries. And then we also provide a platform where a democracy can at least start and maybe not ever be as robust as ours, but at least be better than what they have now. So, that's a real concern. China is stepping into a lot of these roles all over the world. And that bothers me because that should be us doing that.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> You\u2019ve also spent a lot of your professional career focused on the threat posed by Russia. Today, when you're comparing the China threat to the Russia threat, how are these threats different?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Can you name one thing you have ever bought that says Made in China? We all can, right? Have you ever even thought about buying a toaster oven made in Russia? The answer is no. And so I'm oversimplifying this a little bit because the bottom line is that with China, we have an integrated economic goal that might help them not want to go to war with us in a way that with Russia, we have nothing.</p><p>I lived in Moscow back in the Soviet days, and my American toaster broke so I went down to a department store and bought a Russian made toaster. I plugged it in and it caught fire the first time. And it is still like that. That's why they don't manufacture stuff. There are other things that they have there. They do have some minerals and some other things. They have a pretty good agriculture system that works not only for their own people, but for that area as well. But the bottom line is that Putin does not have the same kind of leverage over us as Xi Jinping has.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> He has nuclear deterrence, but he doesn't have economic deterrence. Everyone is watching to see what happens in the negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, the war that Russia clearly did start, clearly unprovoked. And as everyone follows the slow-moving headlines on this, I'm wondering if you think Vladimir Putin, who was a former spy himself, sees the world differently than a former businessman, which Donald Trump certainly has skills in the business world. But where do you see these two things potentially colliding in terms of how the U.S. needs to be approaching negotiating with someone like Putin?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Putin is not only a former intelligence guy from Russia. He also served as second chief directorate. And just to explain, first chief directorate spies, like CIA does, like MI6 does. You go overseas, you spot, assess, develop operations and things like that. The second chief directorate, they were the ones that put anybody who dared to say that the Soviet Union wasn't the best thing in the world into gulags. They also tortured people, dissidents, et cetera. And so he came from the nasty side of the KGB. And he's always been a believer in Russia having lost something under Yeltsin. And a guy like him - and there are a lot of them like him, just think of our version of white supremacists or white Nazi or American Nazis, things like that - that's their version. These are the people that support and work in the second chief directorate. So, that's the concern.</p><p>He doesn't care about human life. He doesn't care if his own people die in a war with Ukraine. He knows they're dying. And he knows that they're not making much progress and he's mad at his generals, but I can guarantee, in typical Russian \u2013 and I don't have absolute evidence of this because I don't have any exquisite intelligence on this - but he's probably underfunding them. They're probably not dressed well. There is still conscription going on there. And they're not that happy either. Whereas in Ukraine, they are fighting for their lives. And that, to me, is what is astounding Putin.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> The Cipher Brief has been briefed on reports from Ukrainians that captured Russian soldiers have relayed some of what they have been dealing with as are deployed to the front. A lot of them are reportedly untrained and in some cases, they reportedly didn't know who their commander was. So we know there's chaos within the ranks for sure. But we've seen something since the invasion of Ukraine that we hadn't seen on the world stage quite like this before, and that is this new friendship without any limits between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Does that concern you in a different way than these threats do on an individual basis?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>It does concern me, yes. It is concerning and it is different now that they claim they have this friendship without limits. But does any dictator really have a friend? Somebody they totally trust that they'll tell everything and vice versa? And if Xi Jinping says, \u2018<em>yes, of course I'll give you some some terrific bombs</em>,\u2019 and things like that, Xi also has to think about what kind of economic downturn is going to happen inside China if every country that sides with Ukraine - which is a lot of democracies around the world - says, \u2018<em>you know, we're going to start boycotting China\u2019</em>. That's one of the things he has to be extremely careful about.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> You stood up the China mission center for the CIA, which is something that didn\u2019t exist in this form prior. What do you think that should tell the American people about the importance of China and the importance of getting good intelligence on China?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>I was on my second tour in Israel when then-director [William] Burns came for a visit and during the long windy roads from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv, he mentioned that he had been talking with a China specialist at the agency and some others and said, \u2018<em>You know, I'm thinking we're not paying enough attention to China as the real strategic threat and even maybe a tactical one</em>\u2019, if you look at tactical being 10 years or less. And he said, \u2018<em>What do you think about that</em>?\u2019 I had been chief of East Asia division and chief in counter intelligence, and we had put Chinese spies behind bars. And I told him that we've been saying inside the agency for years, we are not paying enough attention to China. We were still dealing with remnants from 9/11 and Iraq and things like that, so I said, \u2018<em>I'm in\u2019</em>.</p><p>It took a while for us to figure it out and what we decided is that the China Mission Center owns property, that's going to be its own department. And so that's the China department basically, and Taiwan department at the agency. So that was one. Number two was we needed to look at the worldwide program. That's where we did the basically the external ops. And the goal was not only to work with stations - everything that we always do when we send out requirements - but we also needed to think about how we were going to do it a little bit differently so we had more success.</p><p>And so we started what we call STED, which is the Strategic Training and Education Department, which is kind of like TED talks, and they actually do a STED talk. And they're the ones that went out to every single mission center chief and built modules that really helped. So, that was the other thing that we did that was very different.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> A fascinating breakdown of how the intelligence community is prioritizing China as an intelligence target.</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em><em> </em></strong><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</strong></em></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>More countries aspire to be nuclear-weapons states, and we should prepare for this eventuality. That\u2019s why the Golden Dome missile defense initiative is timely and needed.</p><p>The war in Ukraine is a stark reminder that Ukraine giving up their nuclear weapons, pursuant to the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, in exchange for so-called security assurances, was a grave mistake. Indeed, If Ukraine retained any portion of its 1,900 nuclear warheads, would Russia have invaded Ukraine in 2014 and 2022 and risked a nuclear confrontation? Even a revanchist Vladimir Putin would have thought twice about the consequences of a nuclear war with Ukraine.</p><p>The 1968 Treaty on the non-proliferations of nuclear weapons (NPT) has been relatively effective in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology as the then-five nuclear-weapons states \u2013 the U.S. Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom \u2013 pursued nuclear disarmament. Over the years, however, Pakistan, India and North Korea have conducted nuclear tests and are now nuclear-weapons states, with Israel not acknowledging that they have nuclear weapons. North Korea was the only country to pull out of the NPT; the others never joined.</p><p>China refuses to enter any nuclear disarmament negotiations with the U.S. and Russia, while exponentially enhancing its nuclear-weapons arsenal. Since the failed Hanoi Summit in 2019, North Korea has raced to build more nuclear weapons and ballistic missile to deliver these weapons, to include a solid fuel Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) capable of targeting the whole of the U.S.</p><p>The U.S. and Israel just bombed Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow, given that Iran was enriching uranium at 60% purity, weeks away from the 90% purity for nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) May 31 report that stated Iran was in breach of its non-proliferation obligations and was denying monitors access to suspect nuclear sites reportedly contributed to the decision to bomb these sites.</p><p>Iran just announced that they were suspending cooperation with the IAEA until the safety of its nuclear facilities could be guaranteed.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It\u2019s never been more important to understand what\u2019s happening in the world. Upgrade your access to exclusive content by </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\"><em>becoming a subscriber</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p>Over 70% of South Koreans believe they need their own nuclear weapons, despite U.S. extended deterrent commitments. There\u2019s also a sense in Japan that eventually they also will need their own nuclear weapons, as a deterrent to North Korea and possibly China. The tension in the South and East China Seas and China\u2019s attempted intimidation of Taiwan are issues that will affect both Japan and South Korea. And indeed, an emboldened North Korea, now aligned with a revanchist Russian Federation, with a mutual defense treaty and North Korean troops in Russia participating in the war of aggression in Ukraine and receiving missile, satellite and nuclear support from Russia, may strike out at South Korea, in a conflict that could escalate quickly, to include the use of tactical nuclear weapons. Other countries in East Asia may feel compelled to also seek nuclear weapons, as a deterrent to any aggressor.</p><p>The same applies to the Middle East. Iran has been clear: They will continue to enrich uranium, despite the recent bombing of their nuclear facilities. But as a threshold nuclear weapons state, weeks away from fabricating nuclear weapons, calling for the annihilation of Israel, will there be a repeat of the U.S. and Israeli bombings? Will Iran now race to acquire nuclear weapons, especially now, given the removal of IAEA monitors?</p><p>Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey are very concerned about Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. Indeed, they may also feel a need to have their own nuclear weapons arsenal, for deterrent purposes. Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan publicly spoke about the unfairness of Turkey not having nuclear weapons as a deterrent given the precarious geopolitical situation in the region.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><em>Sign up today</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p>Our missile defense capabilities have lagged behind the advances in nuclear-weapons technology, especially the lethality of today\u2019s nuclear weapons that are eighty times more powerful than the atomic bombs used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p><p>There are currently over 13,000 nuclear weapons in the global stockpile of nuclear weapons, down from over 60,000 nuclear weapons during the Cold War. The New START arms control treaty between the U.S. and the Russian Federation, responsible for this reduction in nuclear weapons, expires on February 5, 2026, and Russia has refused to engage substantively on a successor to New START. So, what follows is uncertainty.</p><p>What is certain is that China will continue to build more nuclear weapons, with Beijing estimated to have over 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030; and North Korea, currently estimated to have over 50 nuclear warheads, is determined to build more nuclear weapons; and Iran is determined to remain a threshold nuclear-weapons state, weeks away from having nuclear weapons.</p><p>If South Korea and Japan and others in East Asia and if Saudi Arabia and Turkey and others in the Middle East decide to go nuclear, the global stockpile of nuclear weapons will increase exponentially. We also know that terrorist organizations, like Al-Qaeda, previously attempted to buy a nuclear weapon or radiological materials for a dirty bomb. And there may be countries willing to sell these weapons and radiological materials, or unable to securely store these weapons and materials that, then, are acquired by a rogue state or terrorist organization.</p><p>These are just some of the reasons why a Golden Dome <sub></sub>missile defense system is needed. Deploying space-based sensors and interceptors is no longer the Star Wars (Strategic Defense Initiative) that President Reagan pursued in 1983. We now have the technology and a budget of $175 billion to establish a viable missile defense capability hopefully within three years. We owe the American people security from the threat of a bad actor using nuclear weapons to attack the U.S.</p><p><em><strong>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/9/golden-dome-missile-defense-essential-americas-survival/\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Times</a></strong></em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business</strong></em><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>FINE PRINT / OPINION \u2014 </strong>\u201cThis report explores the environmental effects and societal and economic consequences that would be expected to follow in the weeks-to-decades after a nuclear war. The exploration begins\u2026with the consideration of four plausible scenarios for the employment of nuclear weapons, along with description of the immediate effects of the energy release and blast from a nuclear detonation.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s an excerpt from Chapter 2 of a new congressionally-mandated study from the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) entitled, <em><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/independent-study-on-potential-environmental-effects-of-nuclear-war\" target=\"_blank\">Potential Environmental Effects of Nuclear War</a></em></em>, that was released online June 25.</p><p>Because I have written extensively about nuclear weapons, including in my 2021 book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/403ad3K\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Blown To Hell</em>,</a> which is about radioactive fallout on the Marshall Islanders from the Bikini thermonuclear Bravo test in 1954, I was surprised to read <span style=\"background-color: initial;\">that \u201cevaluation of radioactive fallout was not included in the scope of the work.\u201d That apparently was because so much had already been published about the impact of radiation and radioactivity from nuclear weapons.</span></p><p>This new NAS study focuses primarily on the release of thermal energy (heat) from a nuclear explosion in the lower atmosphere, as well as kinetic energy (blast) and the air shockwave caused by the latter. A nuclear detonation in the atmosphere, where the fireball does not hit the ground, releases some 35 percent of its energy in heat; another 50 percent in blast and shock wave, and the remaining 15 percent of energy in radiation.</p><p>Nonetheless, I believe the study is worth exploring, if only, for example, to see the \u201cfour plausible scenarios\u201d the expert writers see that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. In addition, studies such as these often disclose facts not normally available.</p><p>There were a series of scientific studies in the 1980s that raised concern about large-scale nuclear exchanges leading to \u201cnuclear winter\u201d scenarios. They showed that nearly every country in the world would be affected, beyond those in conflict. In those studies, nuclear use by superpowers caused immense firestorms whose light-blocking soot and particulates reduced sunlight to disrupt worldwide agriculture and ecosystems for years.</p><p>I believe reminders such as that make all such studies valuable, because they can reduce the likelihood of any nuclear weapon use. The authors of this new study apparently feel that way since they wrote, \u201cWith growing risks of nuclear proliferation and evolving warfare doctrines, this renewed scientific examination aims to quantify the grave global stakes should such hostilities occur in the current and future security environments.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Sign up for the </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Cyber Initiatives Group</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

They are the United Kingdom with an estimated 225 weapons; France with 290; India with 160; Pakistan with 170; China with 500 and growing; and North Korea with 50.</p><p>I must point out here that the NAS has omitted Israel, which has some 90 or more nuclear weapons, according to experts such as Hans Kristensen and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The U.S. Government and apparently the NAS follow Israeli policy of ambiguity, neither confirming nor denying their nuclear weapons exist, although they have had them since the late-1960s. Israel even has sub-launched, nuclear-tipped cruise missiles as well as nuclear bombs and land-based missiles.</p><p>In its study, the NAS presents what it describes as four plausible scenarios for nuclear weapon use:</p><p>Large-scale strategic usage of 2,000 warheads, where the scenario is that the Russia/U.S. nuclear exchanges begin at the tactical level, but escalate to the strategic level;</p><p>Moderate-scale strategic exchange of 400 warheads, where the scenario is a China/U.S. conflict;</p><p>Small-scale regional conflict of 150 warheads, such as one between Pakistan and India;</p><p>Very small-scale use of a single warhead, to \u201cdemonstrate resolve\u201d and \u201ca willingness to employ nuclear weapons.\u201d This scenario seems to follow the Russian strategy of \u201cescalate to de-escalate,\u201d that initially appeared in the past decade.</p><p>The NAS study says it has proposed these scenarios in order \u201cto study potential environmental inputs,\u201d though the study also \u201crecommends further development of a more comprehensive set of scenarios.\u201d</p><p>I should point out that I have been told that in U.S. military wargaming, when the scenario leads to one side using a nuclear weapon and escalation begins, the game usually ends because no one is prepared to say where nuclear exchanges are going or how to stop them.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

But the study notes that \u201cwhile some military targets are likely in or near urban areas, present-day [nuclear] weapons are generally more accurate and are of lower yields, which would likely reduce the impact on civilian structures.\u201d</p><p>Hiroshima, the Japanese target for the first U.S. atomic bomb, was described in a 1945 pre-attack U.S. government document put together by Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s Target Committee as \u201can important depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged.\u201d</p><p>The point was then, and I believe it remains now, that any decision to use a nuclear weapon is in recognition that its use would destroy property and kill many people, both military and civilian. Remember, some 70,000 people were killed at Hiroshima with thousands more dying later from effects of that one atomic bomb.</p><p>The NAS study points out, \u201cFollowing a nuclear blast [totaling one megaton], there are two surface-temperature pulses and two pulses of thermal radiation from the fireball.\u201d The first thermal pulse lasts just one-tenth of a second but is \u201ccapable of permanent or temporary effects on the eyes.\u201d</p><p>The second thermal pulse may last up to ten seconds and \u201ccarries about 99 percent of total thermal radiation energy\u2026 This radiation is the main cause of skin burns up to 12 miles or more away, and of eye effects at even greater distance. The radiation from the second pulse can also cause fires to start under suitable conditions.\u201d There was a firestorm at Hiroshima.</p><p>When it comes to the blast effect from nuclear weapons, the NAS study says, \u201cMost thermal radiation reaches material in advance of the blast wave,\u201d something that is not generally understood. The study adds, \u201cThe blast can extinguish flames, but can also leave smoldering material and rubble which can grow into larger fires. Blast waves can cause damage that results in secondary ignitions, thus being an additional source of fire starts.\u201d</p><p>Within the city limits of Hiroshima, 92 percent of all buildings were destroyed or damaged. Of that number, 63 percent were completely destroyed by fire, with only 5 percent completely destroyed only by blast.</p><p>The NAS study describes agriculture and food production as among the economic consequences of nuclear weapon usage, saying there \u201ccan be extensive direct and indirect impacts\u2026with far-reaching consequences for immediate and long-term food security.\u201d</p><p>In one of several radiation mentions, the NAS study says, \u201cRadioactive fallout, pollution, and habitat destruction could contribute to the decline of various plant and animal species, disrupting ecosystem services crucial for maintaining soil fertility, pest control and ecosystem health. This could further challenge agricultural systems to recover and adapt to the new post-war conditions.\u201d</p><p>I saw first-hand in the Marshall Islands in the 1970s that decades after being subjected to radioactive fallout from a powerful thermonuclear weapon ground-burst more than 100 miles away, plants grown on land and shellfish from the sea still showed radioactivity that made them dangerous to eat.</p><p>There is a footnote in the NAS study scenarios section that mentions so-called countervalue nuclear targets, which it describes as \u201ccivilian and cultural targets, population centers and infrastructure.\u201d In other words, they are urban or suburban civilian-populated areas.</p><p>That footnote adds: \u201cIn some sense, countervalue targets can be understood to be punitive or for revenge; however, these terms are currently considered out-dated and inappropriate with current U.S. nuclear strategy.\u201d</p><p>As I noted earlier, Oppenheimer and his Target Committee saw their massively powerful atomic bombs as devices to end a war, not fight one. In my terms, in 1945 they understood that their new nuclear bombs were terror weapons, designed to show how many buildings could be destroyed and people killed with a single bomb.</p><p>And I believe now, however one talks about nuclear weapons and no matter the number they have, they remain today terror weapons \u2014 and that is what deters their use today \u2013 at least against a nation that has its own nuclear weapons or is allied with such a nation.</p><p><em><strong><em>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

It\u2019s another indicator that beneath the surface calm of Taiwan\u2019s vibrant cities, a more profound change is taking shape and in government halls, military installations, and civil society groups. A growing sense of urgency is quietly emerging.</p><p>China\u2019s preparation for a potential invasion is no longer a distant possibility but a reality rapidly coming into focus \u2014and defense planners are grappling with a pressing question: how and when will Washington act?</p><p>\u201cTaiwan is incredibly reliant upon U.S. support for both deterrence against China, as well as a war-fighting invasion scenario,\u201d Kitsch Liao, associate director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global China Hub, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThe U.S. is the sole arms supplier for Taiwan because China has coerced every other country into not selling Taiwan any weapons.\u201d</p><p>Taiwan, a democratic and technologically vital island of 24 million people, faces increasing military, economic, and political pressure from Beijing. As China <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/articles/china-taiwan-weekly-update-july-3-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">accelerates</a> its gray zone and overt military activities around the island, from AI-generated deepfakes and disinformation targeting political candidates to drones breaching airspace and the use of fishing vessels operating under PLA guidance, Taiwan\u2019s defenses\u2014and America\u2019s credibility as a regional power\u2014are being tested.</p><p><strong>Xi\u2019s Calculus: When Will He Move?</strong></p><p>While Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly <a href=\"https://www.usip.org/publications/2025/02/xi-jinpings-calculus-cross-strait-conflict#:~:text=This%20article%20explores%20several%20specific,Taiwan%2C%20the%20likelihood%20of%20a\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">speaks</a> of \u201cpeaceful reunification,\u201d some analysts see his strategy shifting dramatically toward preparation for a potential war. In December, the People\u2019s Liberation Army launched its largest naval operation in the Taiwan Strait since 1996, simulating a blockade and attacks on foreign ships. Amphibious landing drills, maritime pressure campaigns, and cyber operations have intensified.</p><p>\u201cRelations are pretty bad, especially as China\u2019s economy struggles,\u201d Taiwanese legislator and Kuma Academy founder Puma Shen tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIf the economy falters, ideology becomes more important. Xi Jinping has chosen nationalism and the goal of \u2018Great China\u2019 as the main ideology, with taking back Taiwan as a key step.\u201d</p><p>In 2021, Admiral Phil Davidson, then Commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, <a href=\"https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/03/22/2003833850\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a> that China might seek to take Taiwan by 2027.

That makes the next decade a period to observe.\u201d</p><p>Even if a full-scale invasion is delayed, Taiwan still faces near-term risks, including cyberattacks, blockades, disinformation, and surprise strikes.</p><p>\u201cA war with Taiwan would not be localized. Missiles would likely hit Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines,\u201d Scott Huang, a researcher at Taiwan\u2019s National Science and Technology Council, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThese countries would get involved.

As Liao points out, \u201cChina observes no rules and offers no restrictions in conducting influence and espionage operations against the Taiwanese public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are talking about everything from ostensibly religious organization exchanges, charity support, to funneling illegal campaign contributions, and utilizing local Mafia for blackmail and potential assassinations,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe CCP United Front and espionage effort has been able to increase existing societal contradictions, such as Taiwan\u2019s ever-difficult identity issues, driving wedges into political issues, and convincing the Taiwanese population that they cannot possibly fight the Chinese.\u201d</p><p>Beijing has been <a href=\"https://techinformed.com/china-readies-for-cyber-attack-against-taiwan/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">using</a> cyberwarfare and information operations against Taiwan\u2019s population ahead of any potential military action. With Taiwan\u2019s strategic location and its centrality in the global supply chain\u2014especially in semiconductors\u2014China understands that victory does not need to come solely through kinetic means.</p><p><strong>Semiconductors and Strategic Leverage</strong></p><p>For Washington, the stakes are immense. Taiwan\u2019s TSMC <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-makes-the-majority-of-the-worlds-computer-chips-now-its-running-out-of-electricity/#:~:text=Along%20the%20way%2C%20Hsinchu%20Science,world's%20most%20advanced%20computer%20chips.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">manufactures</a> approximately 90 percent of the world\u2019s advanced semiconductors, powering AI, military systems, and the global economy. Washington has been trying to change that.</p><p>TSMC\u2019s decision, made <a href=\"https://www.tsmc.com/static/abouttsmcaz/index.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than</a> five years ago, to build fabrication plants in the United States\u2014most notably a $40 billion investment in Arizona\u2014has been hailed as a move to bolster supply chain security and reduce dependence on East Asia. The project includes two advanced chip facilities in Phoenix, one of which is expected to manufacture cutting-edge 3-nanometer chips by 2026.</p><p>But Chen\u2019s comments reflect a deeper strategic reality: the most advanced nodes of chip manufacturing, engineering talent, and supply chain infrastructure remain deeply entrenched in Taiwan. The Arizona expansion may provide redundancy, but some experts believe it cannot fully replace the island\u2019s dominant role in global chip production. For Beijing, that leverage adds to the strategic calculus. For Washington, it highlights why Taiwan\u2019s security is inextricably linked to America\u2019s economic and national security interests.</p><p>\u201cSemiconductors are Taiwan\u2019s major strategic asset. But whether the recent investment in Arizona was TSMC\u2019s idea or happened under U.S. pressure is unclear,\u201d Liang-Chih Evans Chen, an associate research fellow at Taiwan\u2019s Institute for National Defense and Security Research, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt could be seen as Taiwan trying to spread its risk by diversifying manufacturing. That\u2019s a reasonable strategy, but it\u2019s not realistic to completely move TSMC out of Taiwan.\u201d</p><p>Beyond economics, the Taiwan Strait is also a maritime artery.</p><p>\u201cAbout 80 percent of ships in Asia pass through the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Shen notes. \u201cTaiwan also produces key technology components, like chips, that power global industries. A conflict would impact housing prices and economies worldwide.\u201d</p><p><strong>America\u2019s Unfinished Playbook</strong></p><p>Despite lacking formal diplomatic ties or a defense treaty with Taiwan, the U.S. remains the island\u2019s primary arms supplier and strategic partner. While President Trump\u2019s current remarks favor ambiguity\u2014he\u2019s declined to specify if he\u2019d defend Taiwan. His administration approved major arms sales to Taiwan and oversaw the highest-level U.S. visit in decades. The mixed signals complicate planning, but signal continuity in support.</p><p>Five months ago, the State Department quietly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/china-taiwan-us-state-department\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">removed</a> language that distanced the U.S. from supporting an independent Taiwan. In March, the G7 issued a firm rebuke of China\u2019s coercive tactics toward Taiwan, omitting the \u201cOne China\u201d language for the first time.</p><p>Vice President J.D. Vance has called China the \u201cbiggest threat\u201d to Washington. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth recently <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0uauGCYMRw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a> that \u201cthe threat China poses is real.

Trump has returned to office with the renewed revelations that Chinese government-affiliated hackers continue to outmatch America\u2019s critical infrastructure cyber defenders through sabotage and espionage campaigns such as Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon.</p><p>The new Trump Administration must rebalance the cyber battlefield in America\u2019s favor by raising and incentivizing cybersecurity standards for the electric, oil and gas, nuclear power, water, telecommunications, financial services, public health, transportation, and other critical infrastructure sectors. </p><p>The mechanism would be the U.S. government, insurance providers, critical infrastructure operators, and technology providers collaboratively defining and maintaining data-based \u201cgood\u201d standards for each sector, building on the greatest strengths of the public and private domains for a \u201ccommon defense\u201d of the homeland, with cyberspace being recognized and prioritized as the first line of defense. </p><p>A new national security prioritization schema is essential because, unlike our traditional, kinetic focused military components, every moment of every day, America\u2019s public and private sector cyber warriors are battling nation-states in cyberspace. We must respond accordingly.</p><p><strong>Raising Standards through Transparency and Accountability</strong></p><p>The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) currently mandates high cyber defense standards for corporate members of the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). The new Trump team should extend this standard-setting practice, partnering with the insurance industry to establish high standards for America\u2019s private critical infrastructure operators.</p><p>The insurance industry would leverage its experience with cyber incident data from hundreds of thousands of cyber incidents to help government set these minimum standards across sectors and functions within sectors. </p><p>The government would require operators to establish Cybersecurity Information Centers (CICs) to audit organizational standards compliance, report their results to the government, and inform the management of their internal cyber security posture.</p><p>In much the same way that U.S. public companies are required to report financial results following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the CIC reporting standard would provide the government and insurers important visibility into operator risk and provide operators a standardized framework for cyber risk management. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Join us in Sea Island, Georgia for The Cipher Brief's </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>2025 Threat Conference</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> from October 19-22.

The water utility\u2019s CIC would continuously monitor its cyber risks against the sector\u2019s ground truth. The water operator, the government, and insurance companies would be informed of whether the utility complies and how well it performs compared to other operators. </p><p>Through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), industry regulators, and potential reinsurance vehicles, the government would work with the insurance industry to mandate compliance or the water utility would be denied cyber insurance coverage. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Sign up for the </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Cyber Initiatives Group</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

The federal government would use CIC insights to invest intelligently in cyber grants for cash-poor state and local entities such as water utilities. Through these smart grants, the government would assume the role of \u201ccyber insurer of last resort\u201d, shifting the risk of catastrophic cyber-attacks from the weakest and most vulnerable operators to the federal government. </p><p>The CIC insights would also inform and bolster CISA\u2019s JCDC efforts to protect vulnerable operators and, where necessary, engage the unique capabilities of the <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/About/Cybersecurity-Collaboration-Center/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>National Security Agency\u2019s Cybersecurity Collaboration Center (CCC)</u></a>.</p><p>Finally, the administration could unleash a private sector boom in cybersecurity and risk management innovation by enabling technology solution providers to conduct the CIC standards audits.

Netanyahu\u2019s visit follows the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran last month. Two items are at the top of Trump\u2019s agenda for the meeting: a ceasefire deal on Gaza, and a nuclear deal with Iran.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Before Netanyahu touched down in the U.S., The Cipher Brief spoke with Ambassador Gary Grappo, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Oman and Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, to discuss the dynamics and outcomes he is on the lookout for at the Trump-Netanyahu meeting. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. You can watch the full discussion on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaxOCtsvOjE\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief YouTube Channel</a>.</em></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>What are you going to be looking for as this meeting unfolds?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>The last time the president and Mr. Netanyahu met, it was very much a Trump-dominated visit. They had a public event in which Mr. Netanyahu shockingly spoke very, very little and even seemed a bit submissive. I'll be interested to see how that dynamic plays out in this visit. I expect it to be very, very different. And secondly, looking at the actual specifics, what comes out of this, what they discuss, what are the issues that they focus on and address, the circumstances of this visit, of course, are very, different from Mr. Netanyahu's previous visits to the White House since Trump took office. </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>We know President Trump is very much interested in a deal on the war in Gaza, and also vis-a-vis Iran. It does seem that Prime Minister Netanyahu may be a little less eager. Let's talk about Gaza first. The U.S. hasn't had much success in this administration or the Biden administration before it in pressuring or using its leverage against Israel to get any changes in terms of the prosecution of that war. Do you think it's a different circumstance now?</p><p> <em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>It is a different circumstance. Certainly the dynamic in Gaza has changed very, very little since the last time they met. The Israelis unquestionably hold the upper hand. They literally control between 60-70 percent of the territory of Gaza. They're continuing their efforts to root out Hamas throughout the territory, as challenging as that is now since they're more dispersed, deeply hidden and it's requiring that the IDF to employ different tactics than they may have earlier on in the war.</p><p>But what has really changed is Iran and what has taken place in Iran over the course of the last month to six weeks, with Iran now greatly weakened. Its threat in terms of its nuclear weapons is much diminished thanks primarily to the efforts of the Israelis, but also to the United States and specifically the decision of Donald Trump to enter the war as he did with the dropping of those bunker buster bombs. So there'll be a bit of a good feeling coming out of that, and deservedly so for both sides. And that is going to factor in, I think, into the conversation they have about Gaza.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>Is it essentially that Trump may feel the U.S. did what Israel had been asking us to do for some time with those bunker busters against Iran, and now we'd like Israel to come to the table and push the Gaza deal over the line, assuming, of course, that Hamas is OK with some of those final provisions? Is that the game here?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>That\u2019s certainly one factor here. Donald Trump did jump into a fray that he initially was very reluctant to join \u2014 he had said so publicly before Israel started its first series of attacks on Iran earlier in June. There\u2019ll be something of that in Donald Trump's conversation with Bibi, but also the fact that now with the great danger tamed in Iran, Bibi has much more room for maneuver, including from right-wing members who have threatened to leave his coalition unless he followed a pretty hard-line approach to Gaza, but also Iran. They may be less of a threat now, given the fact that the threat from Iran has diminished.</p><p>And there's a third factor here, and Donald Trump has hinted to this in the last week to 10 days, and that is the charges hanging over Bibi Netanyahu's head. Donald Trump has intimated making a statement that these charges should be dismissed. Mr. Trump is very, very popular in Israel, and if he's making statements like this, which is inserting himself into the judicial process in Israel in a very direct way, it can have a very telling effect on Netanyahu's right wing \u2014 even if they threaten to leave, Mr. Netanyahu may stand a better chance in any elections which might result from the collapse of his coalition.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Apply for a seat at the table today.</em></strong></em></u></a></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>Let's go to Iran. Donald Trump would love what he would consider a good deal with Iran. Netanyahu and that right flank, not so much.</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>No, not at all. Trump very, very much fears getting drawn into another Middle East war and to allow the Israelis to press the advantage, which they may very well do even without the United States. There\u2019s the fear that once again, the Americans may be drawn into the conflict, particularly given the likelihood that the Iranians are going to move to expedite the development of their weapons program, whatever its current state may be. And there seems to still be some question about how much of the more highly enriched uranium they have, how many centrifuges they may still have and where they are located, which could require another American intervention. And I think Trump is fearful of that.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>The question of the Trump administration's leverage is interesting. I was struck by the fact that during that period when a ceasefire was first agreed to, to end this recent 12-day campaign in Iran, there was a moment when President Trump took to social media to say to the Israelis, stop those bombers. It does seem like at least for the short term, he'd like the Israelis to lay low, right?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>Absolutely. Don't forget Mr. Trump has his right wing to answer to as well. It was known from the outset that some of his more hardline supporters were very much opposed to the American intervention in Iran and still are despite the obvious success of the American involvement. They really would like to see us close the book on our intervention there because they also see a real danger of the Americans being further entrapped, they would say, in another Middle East war if the Israelis decide, as you say, to press the advantage.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>We spoke soon after President Trump had announced his arrangement under which the U.S. would take control in Gaza. Whatever happened to that?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>It has been forgotten, but I think it's been put on the shelf, which in fact has become a library of plans for settling the Israeli-Palestinian dispute that never get implemented. I just don't see it as a possibility. What we're currently discussing is a ceasefire, and there are some signs that Hamas may be taking it a little more seriously than they have previously. The Israelis have indicated their willingness to accept it, although I'm sure there are some caveats. But what the administration would like to see is the ceasefire go into effect with assurances provided by the United States that negotiations for a permanent end to the conflict would continue during this 60-day period. And I'm not sure the Israelis are prepared to agree to that. I'll have to see. I'm sure that'll be a discussion point when they meet.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

They do not want to see a continuation of an active conflict in Iran. So they will be hoping that the president can keep the lid on that.</p><p>And then secondly, for Mr. Trump, [the normalization of Israeli-Saudi ties] still remains his ace in the hole. This is something that Bibi Netanyahu very, very much wants to have \u2014 it would be a signature achievement, but that's going to require an acceptable solution to the war in Gaza. And so that's an ace in the hole for Trump if he decides to play it, if he has spoken at all with the Saudis about this possibility. They have previously indicated their hesitancy to enter into any normalization talks without a clear path toward a Palestinian state. They might be willing to accept some general verbiage around that point without necessarily committing to a Palestinian state in terms of a time frame. But they very much want to see an end to this war and a change in the predicament of the Palestinian people of Gaza who still remain suffering, huddled up in a very, very small area with food shortages, even famine and starvation in some areas. A massive humanitarian effort is going to be necessary.</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> on YouTube?

Netanyahu continues to push a no-holds-barred war in Gaza and an uncompromising position on Iran and its nuclear program; Donald Trump is looking to make deals on both fronts.</p><p>Publicly, Trump and Netanyahu will no doubt cheer the success of recent strikes against Iran and the coordination that was evident between the two nations during that 12-day war. In the wake of those attacks, Trump offered to negotiate with Iran, and he has repeatedly urged Israel and Hamas to accept what he calls a \u201cfinal proposal\u201d for a Gaza truce. </p><p>These are the latest in a series of efforts the President has made to make peace on the global stage. As a candidate, Trump promised quick solutions to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and since his second inaugural, he has expended significant diplomatic efforts on Iran and global trade disputes as well. And other than a few trade agreements, he has made no major deals as yet. Might the Netanyahu visit change that? </p><p>Experts say the hurdles involve domestic pressures on the Israeli Prime Minister, who has shown little interest in deals that don\u2019t suit the right-wing nationalists in his government.</p><p>\u201cFor Netanyahu, there are domestic political concerns that are influencing his enthusiasm about proceeding with a ceasefire [in Gaza] or formal negotiations with Iran,\u201d Jason Campbell, Senior Fellow at The Middle East Institute, told The Cipher Brief. \u201cI think that will continue to be a flashpoint in his discussions with President Trump.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Ambassador Gary Grappo, whose diplomatic career included high-level postings in Oman, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, said that Trump\u2019s decision to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2013 something Netanyahu clearly wanted the U.S. to do \u2013 may help him press the Israeli leader to halt his campaign in Gaza.</p><p>\u201cDonald Trump jumped into a fray that initially he was very reluctant to join, and had said so publicly before Israel started its first series of attacks on Iran,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. He expects Trump to use that \u201cbig favor to Israel,\u201d as he called it, in his discussions with Netanyahu. </p><p><strong>A rare rift</strong></p><p>Although President Trump has boasted frequently of his close relationship to Israel \u2013 the country \u201chas never had a better friend in the White House,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/8/trump-tells-jewish-americans-he-is-israels-best-friend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a> during his first term. But he has stymied Netanyahu several times since his return to office. </p><p>The last time the Israeli Prime Minister came to the White House, Trump refused to give him a green light for attacking Iran, and just days before Israel\u2019s strikes last month, he <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/trump-told-netanyahu-not-strike-iran-nuclear\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said publicly</a> that such attacks would be \u201cinappropriate.\u201d </p><p>Earlier this year, Netanyahu <a href=\"https://jweekly.com/2025/05/07/us-announces-truce-with-houthis-without-telling-israel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">was reportedly furious</a> to learn that the Trump administration had negotiated directly with Hamas to free U.S. hostages, and that the White House had ended its campaign against Houthi militants without informing Israel. It didn\u2019t help matters that when Trump took his four-day visit to the Middle East in May, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mideast-trump-israel-diplomacy-saudi-syria-gaza-5d20c749f79b3e5c7b78def1d6588334\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he chose</a> to leave Israel off the itinerary.</p><p>After that trip, former White House Middle East adviser Dennis Ross<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/trumps-gulf-tour-the-money-deals-the-diplomacy-and-what-comes-next\" target=\"_self\"> told The Cipher Brief</a> that \u201cthe Israelis are learning that President Trump is going to do what he decides is in our interests \u2013 we've seen a pattern recently of, \u2018We'll do what we want, and it doesn't necessarily mean we feel their interests have to be taken into account.\u2019\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a rupture of the relationship, Ross said, but it was highly unusual for a self-proclaimed \u201cbest friend\u201d of Israel. </p><p>The June 22 U.S. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts-assess-strikes-response-and-what-comes-next\" target=\"_self\">bunker-buster strikes</a> \u2013 which some referred to as a \u201cfavor\u201d to Israel \u2013 appear to have swung the U.S.-Israel pendulum back in a more favorable direction. <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-thanks-trump-for-support-tells-iranians-your-liberation-from-tyranny-is-closer-than-ever/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netanyahu said</a> as much last week, thanking Trump for his \u201csteadfast stance\u201d on Iran and his overall support of Israel. \u201cI thank him for his consistent support of our country,\u201d he said.</p><p><strong>Deal or no deal, part one: The Gaza war</strong></p><p>Since the strikes against Iran, Trump has been pressing Netanyahu hard \u2013 demanding almost, that he finalize a proposed 60-day ceasefire deal with Hamas. </p><p>This week, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-07-02-2025-111a1cf968318cb0fb6d9865a3ac84dc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump wrote</a> on social media that Israel had \u201cagreed to the necessary conditions to finalize\u201d the ceasefire, \u201cduring which time we will work with all parties to end the War.\u201d The<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-negotiations.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> outlines of the deal</a> include the release of the hostages \u2013 there are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-hostages-released-76f4aef0816546f5048ca881bcd32e4b\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">about 50</a> remaining in Gaza, and authorities believe fewer than half of them are still be alive.

Israel would pull back troops from Gaza, and negotiations would continue over those 60 days to bring about the end of the war.</p><p>Hamas says it is weighing the proposal. Its prime demand is for assurances that the process produces an end to the war \u2013 but Israel hasn\u2019t agreed to the plan either. Netanyahu has yet to commit to a final resolution to the war, only a temporary ceasefire, and he and his government are insisting on a complete dismantling of Hamas \u2013 both its military wing and government.</p><p>\u201cThere will be no Hamas,\u201d Netanyahu said recently. \u201cWe will free our hostages, and we will defeat Hamas.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Sign up for the <a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cyber Initiatives Group</a> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

Grappo said, \u201cand specifically the decision of Donald Trump to enter the war as he did with the dropping of those bunker-buster bombs. And that is going to factor into the conversation they have about Gaza.\u201d</p><p>The families of the Israeli hostages appear to understand the Iran connection. Several family members set up tables on Friday outside the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, calling for \"One Big Beautiful Hostage Deal.\"</p><p>Former hostage Keith Siegel, an Israeli-American who was freed earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-04/ty-article/.premium/one-big-beautiful-hostage-deal-hostage-families-protest-outside-u-s-embassy-branch/00000197-d4d3-d78d-a39f-ddd7dcf00000\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told the gathering</a>, \"The leader who achieved a cease-fire with Iran can also deliver the deal of all deals in Gaza,\" adding, \"This is our moment, the families are waiting. The 50 hostages are waiting.\"</p><p><strong>Deal or no deal, part two: What's next for Iran?</strong></p><p>Trump and Netanyahu will no doubt compare notes on the damage done by their strikes on the three Iranian nuclear sites. Trump\u2019s insistence that the Iranian nuclear program was \u201cobliterated\u201d is not a view shared by the intelligence services of either country \u2013 and the Israelis in particular see the Iran issue as unfinished business. </p><p>\u201cItem one on the agenda will be collaborating on the current status of the Iranian regime and its nuclear capabilities, and from that to assess how best to approach this in the near to medium term,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWhat are the near and medium-term objectives? Can we come to some sort of an understanding or agreement there on how to pursue them?\u201d</p><p>Campbell believes Trump will seek \u201csome path to negotiation\u201d on Iran, but he added that \u201cit will remain to be seen the degree to which Netanyahu and Israel agree on the steps to be taken.\u201d</p><p>While Trump sees the attacks on Iran as a potential opening for a deal \u2013 with the big \u201cif\u201d involving how Iran responds \u2013 Netanyahu and his right-wing cabinet members see a chance to stop Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and missile programs once and for all. In this view, it\u2019s a time to deliver knockout blows, not a moment for diplomacy. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\">Sign up today</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>For this reason, Cohen says, Netanyahu wants U.S. backing for possible additional strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. </p><p>\u201cWe've bought time [with the damage done to Iran\u2019s nuclear program], and from the Israeli perspective, they want to make sure that that time actually extends out as long as possible,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cMy guess is Netanyahu is also going to be pushing to maintain the sanctions on Iran, and Trump has sort of shown a little bit of softness or openness to relaxing some of those. I don't think that's what Netanyahu would want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is some distance between the positions of Mr. Trump and the Israeli government, including Mr. Netanyahu, on Iran,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cAnd don't forget Mr. Trump has his right wing to answer to as well. It was known from the outset that some of his more hardline supporters were very much opposed to the American intervention in Iran and still are\u2026They also see a real danger of the Americans being further entrapped in another Middle East war if the Israelis decide to press the advantage.\u201d</p><p><strong>The Saudi factor \u2013 and the Gaza \u201cRiviera\u201d</strong></p><p>Beyond Gaza and Iran, President Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d Middle East deal involves another major power in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia. Trump\u2019s singular foreign policy achievement during his first term was the so-called Abraham Accords, which produced peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. And he has made clear his wish to bring Saudi Arabia into those agreements.</p><p>The Biden administration was pursuing a Saudi-Israeli rapprochement as well, but all progress on that front ended abruptly with the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and the war on Gaza that followed. Saudi Arabia has insisted on a peace deal in Gaza and a plan for a Palestinian state as prerequisites for entering into any deal with the Israelis. Trump would love to be seen as the architect of this new and potentially critical piece of the Abraham Accords, and certainly the Israelis would love to see it happen. </p><p>\u201cFor Mr. Trump, this still remains his ace in the hole,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cIt's something that Bibi Netanyahu very, very much wants to have. It would be a signature achievement to have normalization of Israeli-Saudi ties, but that's going to require an acceptable solution to the war in Gaza. And so that's an ace in the hole for Trump if he decides to play it.\u201d</p><p>One thing is clear, as Netanyahu heads for Washington: Trump\u2019s last big plan for Gaza \u2013 the idea that the U.S. would take over the territory and create a real-estate bonanza on the \u201cRiviera\u201d \u2013 is no longer in the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI think it's been forgotten,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cOr at least it's been put on the shelf, and that shelf has over the years, become a library of plans for settling the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>It pays to be a Subscriber+Member.

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION --</strong> The United States is facing a quiet and rapidly growing threat across the digital landscape, an unseen mathematical space of binary code and shadowy actors. This landscape demands more, not less, attention, and urgently, if the U.S. is to win the strategic competition of this generation.</p><p>The most sophisticated and ambitious of our adversaries is the government of the People's Republic of China in Beijing, which is pursuing an aggressive national strategy to undermine America's digital future.</p><p>More than 20 years have passed since the last major reorganization of the U.S. intelligence community. In that time, the adversarial threat landscape has changed dramatically, and technology has become central to the intelligence mission. With ever-increasing demands being placed on the Intelligence Community (IC) in a time of fiscal constraint, it is right to ask whether it is optimized for the emerging threats of tomorrow. It is not.</p><p>Given these stakes, lawmakers and national security leaders debating the most significant reforms since 2004 face a critical choice: focus on the real challenges posed by China's digital strategy or become mired in bureaucratic reshuffling.</p><p>The current debate in Washington, focused on the Intelligence Community Efficiency and Effectiveness Act of 2025, exemplifies this risk. It proposes substantial cuts and a restructuring of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which has indeed grown beyond its envisioned size and narrow mission. While ODNI's future size and structure merit discussion, that topic should not distract policymakers with arguments over bureaucratic power, resources, and prestige while missing the bigger, more urgent picture.</p><p>The true measure of reform should not be judged by organizational charts, which rarely impact mission success. The core issues are aligning skills and resources with our most pressing challenges, eliminating bureaucracy that fails to contribute meaningfully to the mission, and unleashing American innovation. Importantly, it is also the candid acknowledgment that espionage demands audacity, agility and risk in the field and in the technical ops center, the so-called pointy end of the spear. Yet institutional incentives often discourage the calculated risks essential to effective intelligence work, creating structural barriers to the bold action required in today's digital intelligence mission.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em></em></p><p>A central challenge faced by the IC is the PRC's aggressive national digital strategy, which explicitly aims for global dominance in artificial intelligence by 2030. Beijing views AI as critical infrastructure for national security and geopolitical influence, backing it with extensive state investment and a military-civil fusion program to weaponize civilian technology. To effectively counter this, the U.S. IC must achieve and maintain dominance in all digital domains where China's advancements are most pronounced.</p><p>Cyber Collection and Defense: China increasingly leverages AI-driven automation to conduct sophisticated cyber espionage, systematically compromising critical U.S. infrastructure, intellectual property, and defense-related information. Yet our current cyber capabilities are hampered by antiquated acquisition processes that treat software like hardware, sometimes taking years to field capabilities that adversaries deploy on rapid timelines.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence: Beijing uses powerful AI algorithms to analyze vast datasets, including the personal and biometric data of Americans, to significantly enhance the precision and scale of its espionage. Meanwhile, IC agencies struggle with bureaucratic barriers that prevent rapid adoption of commercial AI tools and make it difficult to partner with smaller tech companies who are leading innovation in this space.</p><p>Strategic Data Acquisition: China's comprehensive data strategy treats information as a strategic asset, harvesting it from commercial, governmental, and individual sources to fuel its AI systems. Naturally, the IC\u2019s ability to leverage open-source data is limited by its available budget, but this is an area worthy of modest additional investment to benefit the mission of all IC members.</p><p>Information Operations: Chinese state actors utilize generative AI tools, including advanced deepfakes and social media manipulation, to propagate disinformation, deepen societal divisions, and reshape the global digital landscape to align with China's objectives. The IC must quickly improve its ability to identify and counter such efforts at scale and at machine speed, which will require investment in sophisticated technical capabilities now, not someday.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Consider this reality: while China can deploy new cyber capabilities on rapid timelines, the IC can take up to two years to procure and field comparable digital tools due to processes designed for a bygone analog era. Creating fast-track authorities means establishing dedicated pathways where software and digital services can be evaluated, tested, and deployed within weeks rather than following traditional procurement timelines. This also requires a concerted effort to drive genuine partnerships between government and private industry, the true engines of innovation, by creating new pathways for tech talent to serve short tours in government and streamlining how the IC adopts commercial technology.</p><p>Critics rightfully worry that rapid acquisition could compromise security or oversight. The solution is not slower processes, but smarter ones that leverage new AI capabilities by creating streamlined security reviews specifically designed for software, implementing continuous monitoring instead of front-loaded approvals (the one-and-done approach), and building accountability mechanisms that match the speed of digital threats.</p><p>The goal of intelligence reform should be clear: promote a culture of bold risk-taking, eliminate bureaucracy where it merely perpetuates itself, ruthlessly drive efficiency to free up precious resources, and reallocate those resources to the challenges of the future rather than the structures of the past. This requires immediate action from Congress to establish new acquisition authorities, from IC leadership to restructure internal processes, and from the private sector to engage more deeply with national security missions.</p><p>It would be a mistake to squander precious time in debates over bureaucratic power while our adversaries move forward aggressively. The United States must match and surpass their speed, innovation, and audacity, focusing exclusively on the real challenges ahead to secure America's digital future.

U.S. forces are deemed potential targets of retaliation and one U.S. airbase in Qatar did come under attack, albeit a largely symbolic one.</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Cipher Brief spoke with General Frank McKenzie (Ret.), who oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East as the head of U.S. Central Command from 2019 to 2022, about the mission and vulnerability of U.S. troops in the region, and what might happen if they were to leave. Our interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>The Iraq War is long over. The United States - in a coalition - defeated ISIS some time ago. The Afghan War is over. What is the mission or are the missions of all those troops that remain in the Middle East?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie: </em></strong></em>I would argue that the fight against ISIS still goes on. We don't actually fight that fight ourselves, but we do support our partners both in Iraq and in Syria who continue to conduct operations against ISIS, which is now newly flourishing based on the turmoil in Syria. That may correct itself over the next few months with the new government, which I think is a good thing. So we're still in that fight a little bit. But to your basic question, our forces are there to train our partners in the region, to work with them, to provide assurance of American presence, and that's largely focused on Iran. Iran remains a singular threat in the region, and we've seen over the last few months, why we need to be very aware and alert to the threat from Iran.</p><p>The other thing is that while we do have a lot of forces in the region, they are distributed. We defended ourselves very effectively against an Iranian attack a few days ago. And forces also provide assurance to our neighbors while they deter action by our potential opponents. Our friends in the region can't leave. They're stuck there, so the fact that U.S. forces are there actually adds to their level of assurance that we'll be a reliable partner should Iran attack them.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>A good many of those American troops are there at the invitation, if not the request, of some of the Gulf states. That's of course not the case for different reasons in Iraq and Syria. To what extent is the U.S. presence, in your view, an answer to those kinds of requests? And to what extent is it strategically smart for the United States?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie:</em></strong></em> It\u2019s a combination of both. It certainly serves our interest to maintain a presence in the region. It certainly serves the interests of the Gulf States and other states that we be there in order to give them additional stability as they confront the threat from Iran. So I think it serves both our interests. We\u2019re actually in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government now. I think we have an ongoing negotiation process with the Iraqis about what our force posture is going to be. So we're in Iraq because the Iraqis want us to be there, not because we're forcing ourselves on the Iraqis.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

We could leave the region, and that's talked about fairly frequently. If we left the region and drew down dramatically, then that assurance component would go away and they would also be, as an effective operational matter, far more vulnerable to attacks from Iran. We've seen how willing Iran is to actually use their military to attack their neighbors over the last few months. That's the thing to cover when we look at why our forces are there: what effects do we derive? Assurance and deterrence against Iranian attacks. </p><p>I think those are all useful things because that keeps the flow of commerce through the region, moving through the Strait of Hormuz. We've reopened the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait recently. I believe commerce is eventually going to flow again, though that's going to take a little time as insurance companies test the waters about what the Houthis are going to be willing to do. But all of those things are very much in our national interest.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>Let's talk about the vulnerability of some of those forces. You've had all those forces under your command. How difficult a task is it to go from whatever the baseline force protection is to us now attacking the nation of Iran? What's the ramp up like in terms of security?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie:</em></strong></em> We have exquisitely rehearsed and prepared plans to protect our forces. As the CENTCOM commander, you begin every day worrying about the force protection level of U.S. forces in the region, our embassies in the region, our American citizens in the region, as well as our friends and partners. So you look at that every day and you balance it against what the Iranians are doing. We have very good ways of knowing what the Iranians are thinking about and what they plan to do. So as we saw recently, we are typically able to adjust and prepare for that. The risk is always that you'll get it wrong or they'll get lucky, and we know and understand that. But we work very closely with forces in the region to ensure they're prepared for these types of things. It's a battle drill. It is an onerous thing to do. You're leaving the comfortable places you live. You're going to places that are certainly less comfortable, albeit for a short period of time, but it's one of the best ways we can effectively save the Iranians from themselves. If they were to attack us and cause significant U.S. casualties, then the potential for upward escalation is very high. We always say the Iranians own the lower steps on the escalation ladder. We own all the higher steps on the escalation ladder. Every CENTCOM commander spends a lot of time looking at that.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

You may not need as much as you've got right now. You need the ability to flow them back in very quickly if you elect to pull forces out. But what we have right now is an Iran that is effectively deterred. They chose not to launch a massive attack on us. Instead, they launched a very choreographed attack, and if we're to believe reporting, that was telegraphed well in advance because they did not want to get into significant combat with the United States \u2014 because they know and understand our capabilities. That's what these forces bring. To draw down precipitously would possibly undo that deterrent effect.</p><p>On the other hand, and this is something that really only the president of the United States can balance, he's a president who has struck Iran twice \u2014 [Quds Force Commander, General] <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/avenging-the-death-of-qassem-soleimani\" target=\"_self\"><u>Qassem Soleimani</u></a> back in 2020, and now this most recent attack. President Trump possesses extraordinary credibility with the Iranians because he's taken bold action two times, which puts him in a unique position that no other American president has had going back several administrations. </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em>D</em><em>o you think that President Trump might have some success in bringing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a place that looks more like a ceasefire in Gaza and a deal in Iran?</em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie: </em></strong></em>Short answer is, I don't know. I do know that we and Israel both share the same objective with Iran. We don't want them to have a nuclear weapon, and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of discussion on that, a lot of assessment. How effective were the strikes? Where are we? What needs to be done? I would assume they're going to spend a fair amount of time talking about that. But I would also say the same thing I said about President Trump and Iran. That same credibility probably extends to his relationship with Israel and the way going forward. So I'll watch with great interest to see what comes out of those meetings next week.</p><p><em><strong><em>Are you Subscribed to </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> on YouTube?

McKenzie said. \u201cAnd it certainly serves the interests of the Gulf states and other states as well that we be there in order to give them additional stability as they confront the threat from Iran.\u201d</p><p>The focus on the U.S. presence in the Middle East comes early on in an administration that has indicated it may want to pivot from a focus on the region and shift attention toward Asia. But testifying just prior to the U.S. attack in Iran, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, who was <a href=\"https://defensescoop.com/2025/06/30/combatant-commanders-centcom-eucom-brad-cooper-alexus-grynkewich/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed just this week</a> as the new CENTCOM commander, said he sees no reason to draw down now. </p><p>\u201cOur approach today is to assess and move forward on a conditions-based assessment,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he told</a> the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cI think, given the dynamic nature of what's happening today, that assessment in the future could look different than it does today, perhaps, and if confirmed, I'm committed into my tenure to continue to assess what our posture needs to look like and make recommendations.\u201d</p><p><strong>What are U.S. Troops Doing There</strong></p><p>For decades, the United States has kept tens of thousands of military personnel in the Middle East, spread across bases from Syria to the Persian Gulf. </p><p>Among the largest are the <a href=\"https://greydynamics.com/al-udeid-air-base-the-largest-us-military-installation-in-middle-east/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Al -Udeid Air Base</a> in Qatar, home to the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing and the forward headquarters of CENTCOM \u2013 with some 10,000 troops \u2013 and the U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet base <a href=\"https://installations.militaryonesource.mil/in-depth-overview/naval-support-activity-bahrain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in Bahrain</a>, where 9,000 Americans are deployed. 13,500 U.S. service members are stationed at <a href=\"http://v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bases in Kuwait</a> and another 5,000 in the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/12/mapping-us-troops-and-military-bases-in-the-middle-east\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">United Arab Emirates (UAE).</a> Maritime deployments that followed the Hamas massacre in Israel on October 7, 2023, added a few thousand troops to the overall number. Finally, roughly 3,000 Americans are stationed at bases in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/after-iran-proxy-strikes-should-u-s-troops-leave-iraq-and-syria\" target=\"_self\">Iraq and Syria,</a> vestiges of the anti-ISIS operations that were carried out a decade ago. </p><p>Proponents of the current force posture see a smart distribution of troops that matches U.S. interests and furthers several key missions: the ability to respond quickly to crises; countering the Iranian threat; bolstering the defense of Israel; helping secure maritime commerce in the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz; maintaining U.S. relations with key Gulf allies; and ensuring that ISIS and other groups do not reconstitute themselves and threaten U.S. interests. </p><p>\u201cThere are multiple missions at play,\u201d Cohen said, beyond the current operations against Iran. \u201cSome of this is a legacy of the global war on terrorism. We have soldiers in Syria and Iraq, doing primarily counter-ISIS missions, some stabilization missions as well. But we also have the major air bases in Bahrain for the Air Force and the Navy, managing air operations and the naval forces in the region. And what that means in practice, is we are concerned about the free flow of commerce through places like the Strait of Hormuz, and making sure that the Houthis don\u2019t interfere with global maritime traffic there as well.\u201d </p><p>Those arguing for a drawdown say that a force of 40,000 is far too costly, and that the stated missions are either outdated or could be accomplished with a much smaller number of troops. </p><p>\u201cMy longer-term view \u2013 even before the Iran strike \u2013 of the forces in the Middle East has been that when you have 40,000 forces in a region, anything that happens in that region implicates the United States, even things that actually aren't in U.S. interests,\u201d Kavanagh, the Defense Priorities director, told <em>The Cipher Brief.</em></p><p>\u201cTo the extent that we can get those forces out and limit unnecessary entanglements, I think that would be a smart move,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that doesn't necessarily mean that you could never operate in the Middle East if there were actually a threat. Air power and naval power is something that's very mobile, and if you had the support of the Gulf countries, you could operate from those bases again.\u201d</p><p><strong>The war against ISIS</strong></p><p>Officially, U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria serve as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, which began as a U.S.-led coalition in 2014 to dismantle the Islamic State (ISIS). Although that campaign was declared a success in Iraq (in 2017) and in Syria (2019), the U.S. maintains nearly 3,500 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/24/us-troops-attacked-syria-iraq-israel-hamas-gaza/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">troops</a> in the two countries. </p><p>Those bases are also considered the most vulnerable to outside attack, and well before the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes against Iran, analysts and policymakers were questioning the wisdom of keeping them there.</p><p>After Israel launched its war on Hamas in October 2023, these bases \u2013 along with a smaller outpost in Jordan \u2013 were attacked hundreds of times by rocket strikes that reportedly caused <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/40-us-service-members-may-brain-injuries-iran-linked-attacks-rcna123591\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dozens</a> of traumatic brain injuries among U.S. troops. In January 2024, three Americans <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/tower-22-and-the-path-to-a-wider-war\" target=\"_self\">were killed</a> and dozens were injured at the small \u201cTower 22\u201d base in Jordan. As <em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/tower-22-and-the-path-to-a-wider-war\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a></em> reported then, the deadly strike prompted calls for ending the Iraq and Syria deployments.</p><p>Bernard Hudson, a former director of counterterrorism at the CIA, told us then that U.S. troops in those countries were \u201cfolks in harm\u2019s way who can\u2019t be protected and are surrounded by Iranian elements in both countries.\u201d </p><p>Today, the case for staying in Syria and Iraq imagines a different nightmare: the Americans leave, and conditions are restored for a resurgent ISIS that could do more damage in the region and beyond. </p><p>\u201cI would argue that the fight against ISIS still goes on,\u201d Gen. McKenzie said. \u201cWe don't actually do that fight ourselves, but we do support our partners both in Iraq and in Syria who continue to conduct operations against ISIS, which is now newly flourishing based on the turmoil in Syria.\u201d </p><p>Cohen concurred. \u201cISIS is beaten down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not gone, though. And the concern is if you begin to take forces away, ISIS will sprout back up. There are also concerns that if we pull out, particularly out of Syria, we will risk abandoning the Kurds, who've been a long-time partner. So, there's an argument for keeping troops there for a host of both counterterrorism reasons, but also for regional stability issues.\u201d</p><p>Kavanagh countered that the threat to the U.S. was minimal, and not worth the investment in U.S. military force. </p><p>\u201cISIS is not a threat to the United States \u2013 at least not the ISIS that's operating in the Middle East,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people argue that ISIS-K is becoming a more global threat, but they're not in Iraq and Syria. And our intelligence community has been very effective at uncovering plots before they happen. So, I'm not convinced that you need a military presence to protect the United States from that threat.\u201d</p><p>The Defense Department has been conducting a \u201cposture review\u201d of the Iraq and Syria deployments for more than a year. The Iraq Higher Military Commission, which was tasked with preparing a U.S. withdrawal plan from that country, hasn\u2019t met since September, <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">according to <em>Defense One</em>.</a> Recently, Maine Senator Angus King returned from a visit to Iraq and said that officials there had asked for the American troops to remain. </p><p>\u201cThey have an election coming up this fall, and that's been one of the significant dangers,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sen. King said</a>, referring to potential threats from Iran-backed militias in Iraq. \u201cIt seems to me, given the renewed volatility\u2026it\u2019s not a good time to be drawing down our forces, because they are viewed as stabilizing forces in all of those countries in the Middle East.\u201c</p><p><strong>A rapid-reaction force \u2013 and the costs</strong></p><p>Many experts say that the brief war with Iran \u2013 and the tensions that linger in its aftermath \u2013 are only the latest examples of a longstanding reality: crises in the Middle East come with regularity. And that, they say, is reason enough for maintaining the American air and naval bases in the Gulf states. </p><p>Proponents of the U.S. posture also note that those Gulf allies want the Americans there. The U.S. has mutual defense agreements and commitments with Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain. An abrupt exit, they argue, could undermine relationships with those countries.</p><p>\u201cThere's a geopolitical bent here in that the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, they all value having a U.S. presence in the region,\u201d Jason Campbell, Senior Fellow at the Middle East Institute, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt provides them both a certain level of added security from Iran, as well as additional access for their respective militaries to training and certain types of equipment that are of use to them. So, there are both security and geopolitical reasons for the presence in this part of the world.\u201d</p><p>Detractors point to the costs \u2013 particularly of the larger bases in the Gulf. Sustaining U.S. forces in the Middle East is expensive, north of <a href=\"https://reason.com/2024/10/08/a-year-of-war-in-the-middle-east-cost-americans-nearly-23-billion/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">$20 billion</a> per year. Kavanagh and Caldwell argue that U.S. personnel in the region require more extensive defenses than those based at home, including hardened facilities and advanced air defenses, to protect them from Iranian-backed drone and missile attacks. </p><p>Meanwhile, each uptick in tensions has meant shifts to a high-alert status that carry their own costs. When the U.S. made the decision to strike Iran, most of the aircraft at the al-Udeid base in Qatar were moved out, and ships stationed at the U.S. naval base in Bahrain were sent out to sea as a security precaution. </p><p>\u201cThere is a heightened level of threat there,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThey'll move some of their naval ships out of Bahrain and out to sea to keep them safer\u2026These are typical things we see, leading up to and enduring periods of tension in the region.\u201d</p><p>Ultimately, none of those measures mattered much in the recent war; the Iranians were clearly not interested in escalation, and their public retaliation \u2013 for now at least \u2013 has been limited to a single well-telegraphed strike against the Al-Udeid base, which President Trump said had come with advance warning.</p><p>But Caldwell and Kavanagh argue that the costs and the vulnerability of these bases alone make the case for a drawdown, or at least a consolidation of U.S. forces in the region to one or two locations. </p><p>\u201cThe \u201812-Day War\u2019 fortunately did not cost any American lives,\u201d Caldwell and Kavanagh <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/28/iran-strike-american-military-vulnerability/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> in the Post, \u201cbut it highlighted our vulnerabilities in the region and underlined how our existing force posture was superfluous to achieving our aims. The war\u2019s end provides an opportunity for the United States to do what it has tried and failed to do for the better part of a decade: rationalize and downscale its presence in the Middle East.\u201d</p><p><strong>What comes next</strong> </p><p>All the past calls for a drawdown of American military power in the region ultimately ran into the same roadblock: It\u2019s hard to disengage from the Middle East. </p><p>President Donald Trump ran for a second term on a foreign policy platform that would decrease American involvement in the Middle East and pivot towards growing challenges in the Indo-Pacific. He referred to himself as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/10/trump-war-israel-gaza-ukraine-yemen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\u201ccandidate of peace,\u201d</a> with promises to extricate the U.S. from entanglements in the region. He may still do so; but like many of his predecessors, he has found it difficult to stay out of the region\u2019s turbulence.</p><p>\u201cI'm optimistic that once things stabilize, at least some of the air and naval power will move out of the region, because I do think there are strong voices in the Pentagon and elsewhere who really would like to concentrate more on Asia,\u201d Kavanagh said. \u201cAnd you can't do that when all your air and naval assets are tied up in the Middle East.\u201d</p><p>Even those experts who support the deployments say they welcome the discussions about their future.</p><p>\u201cThere's certainly debate to be had for the number of installations required,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHow many forces should indeed be there and what specific purpose should they serve? I think those are all fair questions, but again, the geopolitical costs of removing forces completely from the region could be higher than many realize.\u201d</p><p>Campbell added that a complete damage assessment of the strikes against Iran \u2013 which is not yet complete \u2013 will likely dictate the way forward, and that until then, there is a \u201cnear-to middle-term utility of having forces and resources in the region just from a more operational standpoint.\u201d</p><p>Cohen agrees, noting that despite Trump\u2019s claim that the nuclear sites in Iran had been \u201cobliterated,\u201d questions remain about the damage done and what may come next. </p><p>\u201cThere's an open question about how much destruction we actually did to the nuclear program with that strike,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAnd if you were to have a more sustained [U.S.] offensive, and if you actually wanted to do something somewhat larger that would actually have potentially a more permanent effect, you would need a bigger operation.\u201d And that, he said, would surely involve the American bases in the Gulf.</p><p>Gen. McKenzie, the former CENTCOM commander, said he welcomes the coming \u201cposture review,\u201d and the overall debate about U.S. forces in the Middle East. </p><p>\u201cThat's a national policy decision that we're going to have to make,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much do we want to leave in there? It's a careful calibration. You may not need as much as you've got right now, but you need the ability to flow them back in very quickly if you elect to pull forces out.\u201d</p><p>Ultimately, he said, \u201cWe could leave the region, we could certainly do that, and that's talked about fairly frequently.\u201d But he added that in the short term, that would hurt the U.S. deterrent effect against Iran, the ability to secure safe maritime commerce, and the relationship with those Gulf allies. </p><p>\u201cI think that's the thing to cover when we look at why are our forces there, what effects do they give, what effects do we derive from the fact that they're there \u2013 I think those are all useful things. All of those things are very much in our national interest.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

Litvinenko\u2019s resulting death from acute radiation syndrome significantly strained relations between the UK and Russia, leading to diplomatic expulsions and increased scrutiny of Russian activities in the UK.</p><p>As much as this event became pivotal in the relationships between London and Moscow and called for a major reassessment of the Kremlin\u2019s intentions and capabilities on European soil, it was still regarded by the rest of Europe mostly as a matter of Russia\u2019s internal issues \u2014 Litvinenko was Russian, he ardently criticised the Russian leadership and he was a high-ranking defector. Therefore, he was targeted by the Russian special services. The consensus in the West was that Russia targeted its own renegade citizens, and not citizens from European countries.</p><p>This proved to be a rather comfortable position for the political leadership of the EU at that time (primarily German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy), which was in the middle of exploring deeper economic ties and a more intertwined commerce with Russia.</p><p>This position allowed the economic and political powerhouses of Europe to safely qualify Moscow\u2019s explicitly hostile actions around the same time towards countries like Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Georgia as mere quarrels between the former Soviet republics. The Kremlin\u2019s distribution of Russian passports in Latvia in 2004; the Kremlin\u2019s blockade of rail and ports and manipulation of theDruzhba pipeline oil supply in retaliation for losing the bid for Lithuania\u2019s only oil refinery Ma\u017eeiki\u0173 Nafta; or Russia\u2019s complete ban of imports of Georgian wines as a punishment for Tbilisi\u2019s pro-Western stance in 2006 \u2013 all these events were disregarded as merely regional tensions between the former USSR cohabitants.</p><p>The Swedish airspace incursion that happened the same year, when a Russian military aircraft without active transponders flew simulated attack runs near Gotland, didn\u2019t match this story, but was mainly ignored as an unfortunate mistake in the then non-NATO sky.</p><p>In 2007, when the websites of Estonia\u2019s government, parliament, banks, ministries, newspapers, and broadcasters websites faced the most massive cyber-attack in history, which coincided with a dispute with Russia over the relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, a Soviet-era monument paramount for the Kremlin\u2019s WW2 mythology, the same whispering was heard in EU high cabinets \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a matter of Russia\u2019s backyard\u201d. Nobody would dare to openly call an independent EU state \u201cRussia\u2019s backyard\u201d, but the reaction towards this incident, widely considered the first major state-on-state cyberattack, was telltale.</p><p>The same year, Putin gave his notorious \u2018Munich speech\u2019 \u2014\u2018\u2019The speech in which Putin has told us who he was\u201d, as<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/18/putin-speech-wake-up-call-post-cold-war-order-liberal-2007-00009918\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Politico has put it</u></a>. Among his disturbing and grim messages, one was particularly ominous: \u2018Whether we should be indifferent and aloof to various internal conflicts inside [other] countries? Of course not.\u2019</p><p>This message didn\u2019t take long to materialize. In 2008 Russia invaded Georgia under the pretext of protecting Russian citizens and peacekeepers in the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. This was the climax of the \u201cRussia\u2019s backyard\u201d attitude. Numerous former members of Mikheil Saakashvili\u2019s team, the then-president of Georgia, said that in private conversations with Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel, Condoleezza Rice and their teams, these foreign leaders and their advisors articulated the futility of resistance and the need to accept the reality imposed by the Kremlin. \u201cAccepting this reality\u201d would mean recognizing that Russia does indeed hold a claim on Georgia, which naturally derives from the common soviet history. (Later in 2014 some representatives of the EU behind closed doors were promoting the same thought regarding Crimea).</p><p>Unfortunately, these and many other hostile actions failed to seriously alarm both the American and European political elites of that period, who were seriously engaged in a \u201cRussian reset\u201d. In 2009 Russian military aircraft again violated Swedish airspace, Moscow cut off gas supplies to Ukraine in the dead of winter (affecting also European countries dependent on gas transiting through Ukraine), and Kremlin-backed hackers attacked the German government.</p><p>In the 2010s Russia, either directly or through its proxies, effectuated cyber attacks on the German and Finnish governments, as well as on energy distribution networks in Sweden; sabotaged arms depots in Czechia; stirred up ethnic tensions in Germany with the \u2018Lisa Case\u2019; hacked TV5Monde and manipulated social media to encourage chaos during Yellow Vests protests in France; infiltrated the Aviation Sector and the Spiez laboratory in Switzerland; attempted to assassinate an arms dealer in Bulgaria; and targeted US and Canada diplomats in Cuba and later in other countries (the \u2018Cuba syndrome\u2019).</p><p>Moscow supported anti-fracking movements in Romania to prevent it from developing its own natural gas resources; attempted a coup in Montenegro; jammed Finland\u2019s and Norway\u2019s GPS signals; backed the hacking of the World Anti-Doping Agency; and attempted to sabotage the global internet infrastructure by exploring vulnerabilities in undersea Internet cables connecting Europe and North America.</p><p>Closer to the 2020s Russian operatives attempted to intercept secure military communications from a French military satellite; the Kremlin imposed trade restrictions on Moldovan agricultural products and manipulated energy prices in response to Kishinev\u2019s increased engagement with the EU; and Moscow manipulated the energy market in Bulgaria by restricting gas supplies.</p><p>Russia systematically meddled in top tier popular voting across the globe, with the following being subjects of major investigations for alleged Russian interference: the 2016 UK Brexit referendum, 2016 US presidential elections, 2017 French presidential elections, 2017 German federal elections, 2018 Finnish presidential elections and the 2019 European parliament elections.</p><p>The amount of money and effort spent by the Kremlin to fund and cultivate separatist, xenophobic, anti-Western, Eurosceptic, anti-Americanist, radical, extreme and divisive parties, movements, groups and organizations across the Transatlantic community since Putin came to power is overwhelming.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

For any war to be \u201cnever again\u201d meant that peace must be \u201cforever\u201d. Hence, attaining peace morphed from a righteous and pragmatic complex objective into a quasi-religious ideology that rejects the mere plausibility of conflict \u2013 \u201ca deep peace\u201d.</p><p>A \"Deep peace\" is not merely a state of prolonged absence of war. The doctrine posits that the very discussion of potential martial threats or military readiness could, paradoxically, invoke the specter of war itself. This ideology has been perpetuated by a sustained period of peace which, rather than being seen as a delicate, demanding and maintained state, is viewed as a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>This means that for \u2018peacewalkers\u2019, the modern-day political apostles of this new security cult, peace is self-reinforcing. The longer they can keep the peace, the stronger on their opinion it gets, and the less probable war is. Hence the obsession with preserving peace at all costs, even if such costs are clearly whetting the appetite of the predator, who never really bothered to camouflage his hostile intentions. This almost irrational refusal to accept any possibility of another conflict on the continent, as if it were a fantasy, a fairytale, a myth, has been ruling out the very discussion of the flaws of current peace and its disproportions, as these very discussions were believed to invite war.</p><p>It seems that only at the Munich Security Conference of 2025 western leaders finally realized that war is now not just at their doorstep \u2013 it has already rung the bell.</p><p>This state of \u201cdeep peace\u201d is precisely the reason why all the signals of hostility from Russia have been ignored by the peacewalkers. This was seen in the reaction of the major western governments\u2019 defence budgets to the overt military interventions conducted by Russia in Georgia, in the Middle East and in Ukraine before 2022\u2014the increase of defense spending was literally marginal.</p><p>Both European and American defense spending remained disproportionately low. The European Union's defense budget gradually declined from 4% of GDP in 1960 to a historic low of 1.3% of GDP in 2014. It wasn't until 2020 that European defense spending saw a \u201cnoticeable\u201d increase of 0.3% - up to 1.6% of GDP.</p><p>A similar trend was observed in the United States, where defense spending as a share of GDP stagnated and mostly declined throughout the 2010s, following the peak of the War on Terror. U.S. military expenditure steadily fell from around 4.5% of GDP in 2010 to 3.2% by 2017, even as Russia ramped up its global assertiveness under Putin\u2019s second presidency. It wasn\u2019t until 2020 that U.S. defense spending rebounded to 3.7%, reflecting a shift in priorities as geopolitical tensions escalated.</p><p>The fact that both European and American defense spending remained stagnant for most of the 2010s, suggests that the West did not perceive even Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine as a serious enough threat to warrant an immediate military buildup. This delayed response underscores the extent to which policymakers in both Europe and the U.S. underestimated the long-term implications of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas, as much as Russia being a direct threat.</p><p>Once again, the pervasive\u2014almost sacrosanct\u2014belief in the enduring power of 'deep peace' has led to the deliberate overlooking of clear signals of impending conflict. This illusion of unassailable peace, fostered by decades of relative stability and economic interdependence, has engendered a dangerous complacency among western, but mainly European, nations.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em>Sign up today</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em>.</em></strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>False Idols</strong></p><p>In order to start thinking about how to fix this situation, we first need to understand how we got here. What beliefs guided decision makers? Within what ideological framework did they operate?</p><p>The first reference point is the perception of national security through the lens of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</p><p>The evolution of the role and, more importantly, the capabilities of NATO in the minds of its members happened under the influence of a prolonged peace on the European continent, with some successful military interventions of its members in the 1990s and 2010s, as well as of a certain image of a hi-tech undefeatable army produced by American pop-culture.</p><p>As a result, NATO has become more of a religious icon, rather than a real military force. The belief in NATO\u2019s capacity has become unconditional and it has fastened the religion of \u201cdeep peace\u201d (which is indeed very similar to a religion because of its irrationality), by providing an image of an almighty protector, which will always intervene in case of trouble.</p><p>The truth is, however, a bit different. While NATO might have proven itself successful in regional conflicts like Yugoslavia or the Middle East, it was never ready to face a full-scale war with a proper adversary like Russia or China. It was even less prepared to face hybrid warfare, with war being waged not only with bombs and bullets, but with information and narratives.</p><p>The reliance on nuclear power was paramount in NATO\u2019s deterrence strategy. The war Russia has launched against Ukraine, however, has shown that nuclear weapons deter only the use of other nuclear weapons \u2013 not conventional ones. </p><p>One might argue that the aggression against Ukraine is very different from a hypothetical aggression against NATO, and if Russia were to invade a member of the Treaty the retaliation would be dramatically different. Perhaps. How can, however, the nuclear arsenal defend even member countries against \u2018the green men\u2019, the scam referendums, the total blackouts due to cyber-attacks, the skirmishes with emigrants along the borders, arson of ammunition stores and further hybrid tactics? This begs a clear answer.</p><p>Therefore, a NATO membership can hardly serve as a justification for not having a powerful military able to defend one\u2019s country against an invasion. This, however, was precisely the belief of the \u2018peacewalkers\u2019 for decades: \u2018NATO will take care of us, and it has nukes. We\u2019re safe\u2019.</p><p>Russia has proved them wrong. And now the new White House administration is considering a major NATO policy shift, where the U.S. might not defend a fellow NATO member that is attacked, if the country doesn\u2019t meet the defense spending threshold. Given the alternative view on global security the new U.S. leadership has taken, the moment Washington refuses to invoke Article 5 following a hypothetical encroachment on a member-state \u2013 the world as we know it is finished.</p><p>Another belief where Russia has proved everyone wrong is the na\u00efve idea that it can be deterred by trade. And yet, even the current U.S. administration seems to be falling into this trap once again.</p><p>This illusion has deep roots. Since the early 2000s, the dominant Western orthodoxy held that deeper trade and economic interdependence with Russia would tame its aggressive instincts and gradually bind it to the liberal international order. From Germany\u2019s embrace of <em><em>Wandel durch Handel</em></em> to the U.S. push for Russia\u2019s WTO accession in 2012, the assumption was always the same: prosperity would soften Moscow, and mutual gain would deter aggression.</p><p>It did the opposite.</p><p>The trick is that the fruits and benefits of trade relations are used very differently in democracies and autocracies. While democracies invest the spoils of trade into raising the quality of life of their citizens\u2014because that is the social contract at the heart of their legitimacy\u2014autocratic regimes like Russia spend those same profits on the <em><em>quality of oppression</em></em>: strengthening their propaganda machines and expanding the coercive reach of their security services. These are the twin pillars of modern authoritarian rule.</p><p>In the 2000s, as Russia reaped massive windfalls from energy exports, it poured resources into rebuilding and modernizing its military. Military spending jumped from just $9 billion in 2000 to over $60 billion by 2014. At the same time, Putin\u2019s regime systematically increased funding for the security services and domestic repression apparatus. By 2025, Russia will allocate a staggering 6.3% of its GDP\u2014over $145 billion\u2014to defense, surpassing even Cold War-era levels. In parallel, the budget for internal security, which includes the FSB and National Guard, accounts for over 10% of the federal budget, while state propaganda organs like RT and VGTRK are receiving $1.4 billion annually, an increase of 13% over the previous year.</p><p>Meanwhile, spending on social programs in Russia is projected to fall by 16% in 2025. The regime is not interested in improving the lives of its citizens\u2014it is interested in controlling them.</p><p>Hence, while Russia has been methodically preparing for war, both externally and internally, the West spent the same decades investing in the illusion of a deepening peace. Defense budgets shrank, armies were downsized, and strategic industries were allowed to atrophy. Europe, in particular, funneled billions into Russian energy infrastructure like Nord Stream, while simultaneously allowing itself to become strategically dependent on the very regime it hoped to pacify.</p><p>In the end, the West was trading with Russia under the illusion that it was exporting stability. In reality, it was importing vulnerability.</p><p><strong>Epilogue: the trench of the Saints</strong></p><p>In the end, however, it is not doctrines, nukes, trade or alliances that hold the gates. It is the trench of the saints\u2014where exhausted, ordinary Ukrainians still stand between us and the abyss. </p><p>And yet, instead of standing behind them as one would behind the gates of a besieged city, much of the West regards their resistance with fatigue, irritation, even suspicion\u2014treating Ukraine not as a rampart, but as a liability. The war, they whisper, drags on. The costs are too high. Perhaps it\u2019s time to talk peace, meaning: surrender something, accept something, pretend that nothing essential is lost.</p><p>But what is being lost is everything.</p><p>The trench of the Ukrainian soldier is not only a physical line against Russian advance. It is the symbolic front line of a deeper war\u2014between freedom and tyranny, law and brute force, future and regression. Just as in the 20th century, when the free world had to rally to crush the Nazi regime not with half-measures but with full moral clarity, so too must the West now realize: Ukraine is not the cause of this war\u2019s duration. Ukraine is the reason we still have time.</p><p>If we abandon that trench\u2014or fail to fully support it\u2014we are not avoiding war. We are inviting a greater one.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><em>\u201cOn both sides they imagined that \u2018bluffing\u2019 would suffice to achieve success.

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>Since 1984, Iran has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism. The designation is justified, given Iran\u2019s continued support of proxies and criminal organizations that kill and terrorize innocent people. That behavior continues today, with the government of Ali Hosseini Khamenei surveilling, harassing, and detaining thousands of Iranians for allegedly aiding Israel -- and offending the morality police, who enforce Iran\u2019s dress code for women.</p><p>The U.S. \u2013 Israel bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites in Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow was more than justified. Iran was enriching uranium at 60% purity, a few weeks away from 90% purity for nuclear weapons. And given Iran\u2019s stated intent to destroy Israel, the bombing of these nuclear sites made imminent sense, especially given the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) recent report that Iran was concealing information on its nuclear program, to include weaponization.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

One of those officers was the visiting Director of the Office of Near East and South Asia Analysis, Robert C. Ames.</p><p>In October 1983, the Iranian government was found responsible for the Beirut barracks bombing by the Islamic Jihad Organization, which killed 241 U.S. service members, 58 French soldiers and 6 civilians, injuring 60. </p><p>These two terrorist bombings apparently emboldened Iran into thinking that terrorism can be effective in eroding U.S. resolve. Thus, Iran continued to support their proxies \u2013 Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen, and Shiite groups in Iraq and Syria \u2013 in its war with the U.S. and Israel.</p><p>In June 1996, Iran was behind the bombing of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 airmen and 498 U.S. and international military and civilian members injured. A U.S. court ruled that Iran \u2013 and its proxy Hezbollah Al-Hejaz -- was responsible for the attack, providing the funding, support and direction.</p><p>This was the very overt Iran, confident in perpetrating these bold acts of terrorism.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

The international community saw some of this in 2009, when the government ensured that incumbent Mahmood Ahmadinejad was reelected president, despite opposition leader, Mir -Hossein Mousavi, having widespread support from the public, promising hope and change. This \u201cGreen Movement\u201d galvanized the Iranian people, resulting in protests, demonstrations and civil disobedience. The regime\u2019s response was predictable: using brutal force to suppress the demonstrations and arrest the protesters.</p><p>This has always been the regime\u2019s response to peaceful protests: suppressing and arresting the protesters. We saw this in September 2022 when Jina Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian -- died in police custody; arrested by the so-called morality policy for improperly wearing her Hijab headscarf. Eyewitnesses reported that Amini was severely beaten and died because of police brutality. </p><p>The Iranian people were irate with the brutal death of Amini. Protests erupted throughout Iran. Iran Human Rights reported that at least 476 people were killed by security forces. Amnesty International reported that Iranian security forces fired into groups with live ammunition and killed protesters by beating them with batons.</p><p>Amini\u2019s death gave rise to the global movement of: Woman, Life, Liberty.</p><p>The regime is now conducting a war against its own people, with widespread arrests of anyone protesting human rights abuses and corruption of the regime in power. </p><p>We would be remiss if we think the Ayatollah has given up on the use of terrorism to intimidate and deal with critics in opposition to his leadership. We would also be remiss if we think the theocracy will cease pursuing a nuclear weapons capability. The regime wants sanctions relief, and they\u2019re prepared to eschew nuclear weapons to get this relief. Eventually, however, they will pursue their nuclear weapons program. We should be prepared.</p><p><strong><em>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/1/irans-terror-legacy-ayatollahs-regime-still-poses-deadly-threat-us/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Times</a></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</em></strong></p><a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em></em></strong></em></u></a>",

Since we are <em>The Cipher Brief</em>, our favorites include not only thrillers and realistic, fast-paced novels \u2013 but some notable works of non-fiction on matters of national security, intelligence and foreign policy. And there\u2019s a cookbook thrown in for good measure.</p><p>We\u2019ve carefully combed through the books that we\u2019ve recently had reviewed by experts who have lived the spy or spy-related life - and we\u2019ve singled out some titles we think you might enjoy at the beach or wherever you\u2019re taking refuge from the summer heat. (<em>And just a note: if you do click and buy using links, we might make a small commission. At least enough to pay for the paper this was printed on.)</em></p><p>Let\u2019s get cooking, shall we?</p><p><strong>Cookbook / Whiskey Category</strong></p><p>Yep, you read that right. Leading our list of summer reads is one that has taken over the #1 spot in Amazon\u2019s whiskey and alcoholic spirits categories, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ZLkEJ4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Spy Walked Into A Bar: A Practitioner's Guide to Cocktail Tradecraft</a></em> by former senior CIA Officers Rob Dannenberg and Joseph P. Mullin Jr. Think of it as a real-life guide to spies and their favorite cocktails. Based on experiences from their clandestine operations backgrounds, Rob and Joe have collected, curated and perfected the cocktails that were enjoyed while celebrating milestone events during their CIA careers. From the drinks they ordered after successfully recruiting assets, to marking the end of a major operation, this book features real life stories and homegrown photos by the authors themselves. </p><p><strong>Novels</strong></p><p>Appropriate for summer, is a new spy novel from Tess Gerritsen, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3G5J0qp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Summer Guests: A Thriller</a></em>. This is Tess\u2019 second spy book, after her very successful TV series a few years ago called <em>Rizzoli and Isles</em>. Gerritsen <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-real-life-spy-coast\" target=\"_self\">talked</a> with Cipher Brief CEO & Publisher Suzanne Kelly about her journey from the popular TV series to spy author in the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-real-life-spy-coast\" target=\"_self\">Cover Stories podcast</a> \u2013 that was just after her first book, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/40wPPIc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Spy Coast</a> </em>was released. Veteran CIA officers Jay and Anne Gruner <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/martinis-and-murder-in-maine\" target=\"_self\">reviewed her latest book</a> about four retired CIA officers living in Maine. The Gruners tell us it is a \u201cgripping account of a complex set of murders, a possible recent kidnapping, and a secretary who was missing for 50 years.\u201d talking about her previous spy-themed book. </p><p>Former U.S. counterterrorism officer and cybersecurity executive Neal Pollard broke the code on Ken Dekleva\u2019s novel, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4nv3byF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Russian Diplomat\u2019s Wife</a></em>. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/i-spy-a-love-story\" target=\"_self\">In his review</a>, Neal says while the book ostensibly is a spy novel set in Vienna, it\u2019s really a love story between two spies. Author (and frequent Cipher Brief contributor) Dekleva draws on his experience as a psychiatrist working for the State Department in many of the locales central to the book and his understanding of human motivation seems to bring his stories to life. We know because we also interviewed the author for the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-russian-diplomats-wife\" target=\"_self\">Cover Stories Podcast.</a></p><p>Speaking of Dekleva, we tapped his expertise to review several books by other authors this year. One worthy of special mention is <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44HgTqG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Poet\u2019s Game: A Spy in Moscow</a></em> by Paul Vidich. Dekleva <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/paul-vidichs-moscow-get-off-the-x\" target=\"_self\">calls</a> the novel is a terrific read about a former CIA station chief in Moscow, now working as an investor in a private equity market in Moscow. The chief was called back to duty though to exfiltrate a former agent who claims to have explosive kompromat regarding America\u2019s president. Navigating between two perilous worlds, those of Moscow and Washington, the storyline seems to offer proof that the cold war never really ended.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

We turned to another seasoned Agency officer, and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/joseph-w-augustyn\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief expert</a>, Joe Augustyn, to <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/from-spy-master-to-story-teller\" target=\"_self\">review it</a>. Augustyn told us: \u201cJim Lawler has written an intriguing and captivating novel that should satisfy the appetite of any spy novel enthusiast. His character descriptions are impressive, his knowledge of the Agency, its bureaucracy and its inner workings is deep, and his operational savvy is on display throughout.

We went to a subject matter expert <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/normandy-la-fiere\" target=\"_self\">to review</a> that one \u2013 retired Army Major General Jack Leide. The book tells of one of the most operationally important but lesser-known stories of World War II. Leide praised the author for providing \u201cincredibly insightful and intricate descriptions and actions of, not only the allied and German military forces arrayed against each other, but how the operation affected many of the local French residents and resistance forces as well.\u201d</p><p>For a far less heroic view of some of the events in that war, there is <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4la0aCs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Traitor of Arnhem: The Untold Story of WWII\u2019s Greatest Betrayal and the Moment that Changed History Forever</a></em> by Robert Verkaik. Recently declassified British MI-5 documents help animate this story of a strategic failure that delayed Allied victory in the war and came at a steep human cost. CIA veteran (and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/martin-petersen\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief expert</a>) Martin Peterson <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/martin-petersen\" target=\"_self\">reviewed the book</a> for us and writes that the author makes a strong circumstantial case that Anthony Blunt, one of Russia\u2019s British agents, played a vital role in passing intelligence to the Germans that damaged the Allies chances of success.</p><p>For a story about operational and intelligence success, there\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44Hi1uq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Taking Midway: Naval Warfare, Secret Codes and the Battle that Turned the Tide of World War II</a></em> by Martin Dugard. Had the Battle of Midway turned out differently, Hawaii and the west coast of the United States stood vulnerable to Japanese attack. The battle was won by the U.S. though through a combination of steely leadership by Admiral Chester Nimitz, and brilliant cryptological work led by a quirky Lieutenant Commander named Joe Rochefort. Normally, our go-to source for book reviewers are gray-haired subject matter experts.

Montgomery, whose master\u2019s degree thesis was on the Solomon Islands Campaign, notes that the author\u2019s writing style with short punchy sentences makes the book a quick, enjoyable and informative read. Dugard joined us for a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rJ9shOAFZCA?si=_IxSVx-Q3azttufC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cover Stories podcast</a> recently in which he explained how he developed his story-telling style and researched the book.</p><p>Another book sure to fascinate many Cipher Brief readers is <em><a href=\"file://The%20Determined%20Spy/%20The%20Turbulent%20Life%20and%20Times%20of%20CIA%20Pioneer%20Frank%20Wisner\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Determined Spy: The Turbulent Life and Times of CIA Pioneer Frank Wisner</a></em> by veteran journalist Doug Waller.

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION</strong> \u2013 On January 27, 2025, President Trump signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/the-iron-dome-for-america/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Executive Order</a> aimed at defending the U.S. against an attack by ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles as well as other advanced aerial attacks; the Golden Dome initiative. The Pentagon moved out smartly to fulfill this order. Industry lined up with ideas on how to defend the U.S. and Department of Defense bureaucrats convened and developed a strategy. All the work that has happened is needed. But we need more.</p><p>We need to build the technology to support defensive systems to secure the homeland from adversary advanced aerial attacks. But we are missing a crucial part of the equation which could be happening now with only limited additional resources.</p><p>The U.S. needs to be moving out diligently to put in place the best collection capability to provide early warning regarding U.S. adversaries. Too often, the U.S. jumps to a solution and forgets that we must start with intelligence to put the building blocks in place to address the solution.</p><p>In this case, the Executive Order asks for a study of adversary threat but that is all. There is nothing about developing intelligence for early warning on adversary intent. This is an important oversight. The U.S. must focus on developing warning that lets decisionmakers know when our adversaries are planning a launch. The important satellite tracking mechanisms that will follow the launches should only be used if the intelligence community misses the early warning.</p><p>To ensure the U.S. is using its resources to its best ability in building the Golden Dome, the entire intelligence infrastructure of collection, technology to support the collection, and ability to exploit the collection - to include analytical experts - must be synergized to provide early warning that an adversary is considering an aerial attack.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

There is a lot of discussion about the need for a defensive system. All of this is warranted, and it is the area where the most money needs to be spent. However, the literature is much less focused on what the U.S. needs to put in place prior to launch to buy time for developing options to counter an attack and limit the risk regarding that decision making process.</p><p>Without the platforms that can collect on adversary intent, capability, movement, and other anomalies, decisionmakers could be left with rushed choices on the use of defensive systems that could result in catastrophic consequences if the technology detects missiles too late or misreads that aerial attacks are coming our way when they may not be.</p><p>Time is the important variable for decision makers. The earlier the intelligence community can present them with analysis and reporting of adversary intent, the better and likely less risky the consequences are for the US.</p><p>For example, if the Intelligence Community (IC) can provide the President with information that an adversary has given an order to prepare an aerial attack against the U.S. - while the attack is being planned but prior to launch - then there are more options to stop that attack.</p><p>The IC is then alerted to track adversary movements so that decisionmakers know how much time they have to decide on an option and which option will work best under the circumstances. In this scenario, U.S. decision makers have days instead of hours, to plan. This allows for a wide range of options to stop a launch - from diplomacy, to sanctions, to military action.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

As I stated, a reliance on this architecture risks being too late in the decision cycle. Kudos to the Army for recognizing the need for <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/land/2025/03/28/army-looks-to-artificial-intelligence-to-enhance-future-golden-dome/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">smart warning</a> by integrating artificial intelligence into their Integrated Battle Command system, but even this initiative does not hit the early warning collection issue head on.</p><p>LTG Gainey, commanding general of the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) hinted at the issue during a House Armed Services <a href=\"https://armedservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ltg_gainey.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">subcommittee hearing</a> in April when he said the Golden Dome also includes left-of-launch operations, providing deny, delay, disrupt and degrade missile defeat effects in coordination with global combatant commands, the Intelligence Community, Joint Staff, interagency, and Office of the Secretary of Defense. This still does not highlight the need for early warning.</p><p>The U.S. can detect missile launches with its existing Space-Based Infrared System satellites in geosynchronous orbit. These satellites can tell where a ballistic missile is going and where its warheads are likely to fall, but the United States wants to develop better warning and tracking by creating a Custody Layer \u2014 satellites that will watch where all the other guy\u2019s stuff is \u2014 and a Tracking Layer that could also determine where more sophisticated weapons, like hypersonic missiles, are headed.</p><p>Fred Kennedy, the inaugural director of the U.S. Space Development Agency and a former director of DARPA\u2019s Tactical Technology Office, shares in <em><a href=\"https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/golden-dome-analysis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Aerospace America</a></em>, his vision of a Custody Layer: \"a constellation that would be equipped with moving target indicator radar, imaging radar and other sensors, to keep tabs on an adversary\u2019s offensive 'internet of things.' \u2026..These satellites would be the equivalent of Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System and U-2 aircraft, but in space. To strike a missile, you have to know where it could be launched from, after all. Complementing the Custody Layer was the Tracking Layer, the satellites that would detect and track hypersonic or ballistic weapons after launch.\"</p><p>This is all important work and needed but note, it is all focused on launch.</p><p>If decisionmakers are being told by the space-based interceptors that attacks are on the way\u2014there is only one option, to intercept. But what if those interceptors misread the information or what if they did not read the tracking in time? In either scenario it could be the beginning of a catastrophic event that is based on a mistake.</p><p>For that reason, we need to start with the intelligence and put as much effort into that as we are on the interceptors. Collaboration with the Pentagon and other agencies that track satellite imagery is key. I would also add that the Defense Intelligence Agency needs to play a primary role in this initiative which must include increased human intelligence and all forms of open source to include commercial data.</p><p>With the intelligence community and department of defense getting smaller, we need to work together more than ever. Defending our nation is a team sport that requires strong intelligence to set up decision makers and operators to make the best decisions possible, helping to mitigate risk. This cannot happen without the defense and intelligence communities working together to provide the first warning\u2014way before launch. Now is the time to push the intelligence community to upgrade technologies that track missiles by providing warning of aberrations in patterns before launch.</p><p>By using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to synthesize critical technical collection with anomalies in open source (OSINT), commercial (CAI), and personal (PAI) data, we could have the cultural breakthrough we need to change how the intelligence community uses technical collection fused with OSINT, CAI, PAI and AI. Against this national security backdrop, we could have our first big win in changing how we process intelligence and safeguard the US. NGA\u2019s Maven program is a big step in the right direction of fusing intelligence to support DoD and the rest of the national security establishment. This practice needs to be more widespread.</p><p>Now is the time to use proven technology with expert analysis to provide decision makers increased time and space to counter aerial attacks on the homeland. The resources involved, compared to the amount needed for satellites and lasers to shoot down the missiles, is minimal. This action can be started now, the technology exists. Putting in place early warning buys time for the US to develop the rest of the Golden Dome security.</p><p><em><strong>Who\u2019s Reading this?

NATO also put on a show of unity and recommitted to collective defense. </em></em></p><p><em><em>The Cipher Brief spoke with Lieutenant General Ben Hodges (Ret.), who served as commanding general, U.S. Army Europe, about what the alliance has to do post-summit to ready defenses for a \u201cfight tonight\u201d posture. </em></em></p><p><em><em>Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. You can also watch the full conversation on </em></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cKUiEtVuyU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief's YouTube channel</a><em><em>.</em></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>We know that President Trump and some of his top national security aides have been deeply, openly skeptical of the NATO alliance, and there have been real questions as a result about American support. I was struck by how effusive, really, President Trump was in his praise of what happened at The Hague and very clear in his commitments. What's your take on how that all played out?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>I think I\u2019m more relieved than surprised. I'm biased because I\u2019ve been a NATO officer my whole Army life, as all Army officers are part of the Alliance. I recognize its importance for America's strategic interests. I'm glad that the president did what he did. There was a huge sigh of relief in the Hague that he even showed up. There was some anxiety about that, or that he might blow it up somehow. So the best outcome did happen. He was there. He stayed for the entire thing. He met with President Zelensky. We got an agreement on 5% across the alliance, with one exception, and then a public affirmation of American commitment to the alliance by the president. That's pretty good.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>You\u2019re referring to Article 5 of the NATO charter, which says an attack on any member must be met by all other members. There\u2019s been a kind of rallying cry among some Trump supporters that the idea that American soldiers would fight for Estonia, for example, that\u2019s never gonna happen \u2014 that's not America first. Talk a bit about the significance of that specific commitment, because it seems to put to rest what's been said before on that front.</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which created NATO, says an armed attack on one shall be considered an armed attack on all. That commitment to collective security has been the glue that held the alliance together. The Soviet Union for decades, now Russia and other adversaries, see this commitment of now 32 nations that if one is attacked, all the other nations would consider it an armed attack on themselves. That was such a powerful part of the deterrence when it's backed up by real credible capabilities. </p><p>For the first time in my life, in his last administration, the president called that into question. I was horrified. That sort of opens a door to a terrible miscalculation by Moscow that maybe the U.S. would not be so committed. Then the Russians could achieve what has always been their dream, which is to break the alliance, to see that members would not respond, and also to continue driving a wedge between Europe and North America. So it was important that the president affirmed it very strongly, clearly and publicly. </p><p>Now, some people ask why would we have American soldiers dying for Estonia? It's an absolutely ridiculous assertion because that is people not understanding why the alliance is so important for us. By the way, this Article 5 has only been invoked once in the almost 80 years of history of NATO, and that was after 9/11, when you had Estonians who came and died because of the United States. </p><p>Our economic interests are tied to a very prosperous Europe, so we need Europe to be stable and secure and prosperous because it affects our economy. Secondly, the access that we have in Europe from the UK all the way to Turkey and everywhere in between enables us to project power, not only in Europe, but also into the Middle East and down into Africa.</p><p>And of course, even the United States does not have enough capability to do everything that needs to be done to protect all of our interests around the world. We need allies, and all of our best and most reliable allies come from Europe, as well as Canada and Australia.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Apply for a seat at the table today.</em></strong></em></u></a></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>Do you think this whole NATO-U.S. rift, whatever one calls it, is that all over behind us?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>NATO, the most successful and longest alliance in the history of the world, has 32 nations now. There are going to be huge disputes between nations all the time. France kicked NATO out back during the time of de Gaulle. They left the military structure of NATO for several decades, but came back. The U.S. had huge debates with the UK and France after the Suez crisis. Turkey and Greece have been almost at war throughout. So, there are always challenges inside any sort of a coalition or alliance for all kinds of obvious reasons. </p><p>The thing that kept us together was always American leadership and the commitment of several nations to say, look, this is too important for us to lose this collective security because of some argument over an economic thing or past grievance. And there's a reason that there are nations still in a queue wanting to join NATO, because they know that their security is so much better if they're part of this alliance.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>The core takeaway seems to be this pledge that all the members except for Spain have made to spend 5% of their GDP on military or military-related stuff. How big a deal is this?</em></em></p><p> <em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges:</em></strong></em> It's an expectation. It's a commitment that everybody achieves this 5% threshold for investment in defense: 3.5% for traditional, what we would consider defense investments, equipment, training, ammunition, personnel; and then 1.5% for infrastructure, rail, ports, cyber protection, all the things necessary to be able to move alliance capabilities around. </p><p>Obviously these things will be exploited in some countries. That would not shock me. But the key was that nations are going to invest in infrastructure, which is badly needed, and the cyber protection of this transportation infrastructure. But also, 3.5 % of GDP, that's almost double for every country from what it was 10 years ago. The United States is not even at 3.5 right now, by the way. So this is going to be a real increase. </p><p>Having said all that\u2014and I do believe in the importance of a metric like that\u2014the most important thing, of course, is capability. Do we have the actual capability to do what we're supposed to do? That\u2019s what will deter the Russians, not a sign on the board that says, hey, we're 3.5. It\u2019s real capability: units that are properly trained, fully manned and have lots of ammunition, aircraft that fly, ships that sail. That's got to be the focus. So I'm glad we got this done, but now we've got to make sure that we turn that money into real capability.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>Do you mean how they spend it? </em></em> </p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>That is a part of it. Where does it go? Germany has a lot of money out there, but the processes are still several years behind. So they've got to fix things internally to take all these euros and turn them into combat formations and capability. They've got the right leadership now to do that in Chancellor Merz.</p><p>But also, I think it's important that we emphasize the importance of readiness to be able to fight tonight. This is a mindset thing. It's not just about buying new planes and equipment and hundreds of thousands of drones. Are you ready to actually deploy on very short notice and fight tonight? Can you get there and do you have what you need? To me, that has got to be job one for every secretary of defense, ministers of defense\u2014 readiness.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>On that \u201cfight tonight\u201d point, it is worth noting that these pledges are to be met by 2035. That's 10 years from now. And obviously, some of the stuff we're talking about takes a long time to manufacture and get out to the battlefield. How concerned are you about that time frame?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges:</em></strong></em> It took us 10 years to get where we are now from Wales. A lot of nations are now spending more than they have since the end of the Cold War. So, of course, I don't like it. We should already be there, including the United States. But I think what we'll see is different leaders, including the American president, continue to track every year. You can't do what they call a hockey stick, where you stay where you are for eight years and then expect that you'll get credit for jacking it up at the end. So there's going to be continued pressure.</p><p>But honestly I don't think too many nations are going to need that pressure. What we're seeing in Germany and in the UK, Finland all the way down to Romania. They're not confused about who the enemy is \u2014 it's Russia. These countries were already moving well beyond 3.5% before this summit. So, I think we're on the right arc and right direction in most places, just not all.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

It suddenly seemed a little bit on the back burner. What are your thoughts on how Ukraine comes out of this summit?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>This is my biggest disappointment from this summit. Ukraine was exactly, what you said, put on a back burner. I'm glad that President Zelensky showed up, that he was invited and that he attended. I'm glad that President Trump met with President Zelensky for about 45 minutes or so. While the president did not reveal a lot of the details, he was more positive about Ukraine than I'd heard from him in quite some time. </p><p>Now, to be candid, the president changes his mind all the time but I hope that this signals that he is more willing and open to helping Ukraine as most of our European allies are. I had hoped that this summit would be another affirmation by the Alliance that we're going to do everything we can to help Ukraine. The organizers shortened it in hopes of making sure that President Trump would stay for the whole thing. And so Ukraine was kind of taken out of the agenda. </p><p>Nonetheless, what's most important is that there seems to have been a positive meeting there. And most of our European allies are even more committed to helping Ukraine defeat Russia.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>You've made the point that Russia is incredibly weakened militarily right now with casualties, the economy, and so forth. And it doesn't seem, in that sense, to be much of a threat. Of course, everything we're talking about and what they were talking about at the summit is all about the Russia threat. So how should we understand the nature of that threat given how weak the country is today?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>This is a great question. Russia, I was certain, would not have made it this long. Given the casualties that they have suffered, the effects of some sanctions on them, and now it looks like they've probably lost Iran as an ally or a source of drones. But China has picked up some of the slack. North Korea continues to provide ammunition. And Russia right now has transitioned to a wartime economy because of course they don't have to worry too much about whether or not the peasants are unhappy that they can't get a new refrigerator. Putin does not have to respond to this sort of thing the way any other democratic leader would have to respond. So he's putting a lot of resources into this. </p><p>That would be over if we could figure out how to stop Russia from exporting oil to China and India. But as long as they can keep doing that, and as long as oil prices stay up, then Russia can keep doing what they're doing for quite some time. At the recent economic forum that Russia hosts each year, President Putin sort of downplayed the economic situation challenges they have. But his own people publicly were saying that they're almost in recession, that they are in fact in trouble.</p><p>What I am sure of is that if Ukraine capitulates or fails, or if we turn our back on Ukraine and Russia is able to take a couple of years to rebuild and fix what is broken, they will be knocking on the door of Moldova and probably of Latvia. Their objective is to break the alliance, to show NATO that nations are not really willing to fight against Russia over a piece of Estonia or Latvia. That would be their terrible miscalculation. So to make sure that the Russians never make that terrible miscalculation, we have to get back to where we were in the Cold War days of spending what's necessary, being prepared so that you can have another 40-50 years of no war with Russia.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

    "description": "<p>Steps you can take to report the theft and check if it\u2019s being resold \u2013 as well as how to protect your next one</p><p>Whether you use your bike to commute daily, for a quick trips to the shops or long rides to keep fit, having it stolen can be a nightmare. Here\u2019s what to do if yours goes missing.</p><p>Report the theft to the police and describe the bike in as much detail as possible, giving the model, make and where it was stolen. You should also include a description of any scratches, dents and marks that could help identify it, and a picture if you have one. You can go into your local police station or call 101 in the UK to file a report. Make sure you get a crime reference number.</p><p>Home insurance policies will often cover your bike when it\u2019s at home but you will probably have needed to pay extra to extend this for when you\u2019re out and about, or if you have a valuable bike. Report the loss to your insurer and give it the crime reference number. Your bike will not be covered if you failed to look after it, such as not locking it securely or with a suitable lock.</p><p>Declare your bike stolen on <a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a>, a UK bike database \u2013 you can do this even if you have not registered your bike on there before. It will help improve the chances of your bike being recovered if there are pictures and descriptions of the bike, and where it was stolen.</p><p>Post on bike and cycling forums, such as <a href=\"https://forum.cyclinguk.org/\">Cycling UK Forum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeforums.net/]\">Bike Forum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclechat.net/\">CycleChat</a> in case people come across it when looking to buy a new bike.</p><p>Look on resale sites such as Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace and eBay to see whether someone is trying to sell your bike. You can set up alerts for bikes that are the same make and model. If you find one that looks like yours, alert the police \u2013 they may be able to recover it. It is not advisable to set up a sting or try to deal with the case yourself.</p><p>Alert the local community on neighbourhood forums such as Nextdoor or local Facebook groups and get in touch any bike shops nearby in case someone comes in to the shop and tries to sell one that matches your description.</p><p>Scuff the frame up a bit using sandpaper, paint and stickers so it is less appealing to thieves. Some kitsch, drawn-on hearts might save you a lot of hassle in the future.</p><p>Register it on <a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a> and upload pictures alongside the frame number, which is usually found on the bottom bracket shell between the pedals or on the rear dropouts where the back wheel slots in. This will help the police trace it back to you if it is stolen and recovered.</p><p>Invest in two high-quality locks to make your bike less of a target. At least one of these should be a good-quality D-lock. Be sure to attach the frame to the stand when locking up.</p><p>Take any removable parts with you whenever you leave it.</p><p>Find and apply for your nearest cycle parking. This gives another layer of protection, but be sure to still lock up securely. In cities there are also many cycle hangars, such as Cyclehoop, which are small bike stores on residential streets you can apply for at a small cost each year. <a href=\"https://www.cyclehoop.rentals/\">Check whether there\u2019s one near you</a>.</p><p>Conceal a Bluetooth tracker on your bike to help locate it if it goes missing. The smaller and more discreet the tracker, the better. Good spots to hide them include under the seat or inside the handlebar. Apple AirTag and Tile Sticker are popular among bike owners.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jun/11/what-to-do-if-your-bike-is-stolen-and-how-to-break-the-cycle\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "description": "<p><strong>4 March 1895</strong>: The popularity of cycling among the aristocracy is remarkable as the bicycle used to be looked upon as the poor man\u2019s horse</p><p>The increasing popularity of cycling among the \u2018aristocracy\u2019 is remarkable. Among recent recruits may be mentioned Lord Zetland, Lady Havelock Allan, Sir Joseph Pease, the Earl of Camperdown, the Duke of Westminster, and two of the daughters of the late Earl of Iddesleigh. Heretofore the only objection urged against the pastime has been its vulgarity. The bicycle was looked upon as the poor man\u2019s horse, and those who patronised it were considered very ordinary people. The utility of the bicycle as a means of conveyance, its capacity for causing harmless and elevating pleasure, and its undoubted health-giving qualities were all ignored at the dictates of the fashionable world. The said fashionable world have suddenly discovered the virtues of the cycle, and, ignoring the fact that even butchers\u2019 boys may derive pleasure from the same source, they have taken to it in numbers. The middle class, a large proportion of whom are born snobs, will, now that the only objection is removed, join the ranks in thousand. It will have an effect also even on those who are not snobs.</p><p>Heretofore many professional and business men have been afraid to appear in public on wheels simply because it would damage them from a business point of view. I have known leading doctors who have made a practice of rising in summer at 5am, to enjoy a long ride before breakfast simply because they dared not appear in public except in the irreproachable brougham. For such as these the bar is being removed.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/04/cycling-notes-snobbery-female-riders-and-dispensing-with-a-brake-1895\">Continue reading...</a>",

With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing</span><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1. What is affiliate marketing?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is an affiliate program?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.&nbsp; Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;5. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing?</span></h4><p><!--Ads Managed by AdSpyglass.com-->\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising.

Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7. Where do I find qualified publishers?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius.

Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10. What is a super affiliate?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.&nbsp; Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">11. How do we track publisher sales activity?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;12. Could we set up an affiliate program in multiple countries?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country.

What is a commission rate?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Commission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Who manages your affiliate program?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Some merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">18. What is a cookie?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Cookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents. When someone clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie is placed on the user's computer or mobile device. That cookie is used to remember the link or ad that the visitor clicked on. Even if the user leaves your site and comes back a week later to make a purchase, you will still get credit for the sale and receive a commission it depends on the site cookies duration</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">19. How long do cookies last?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;The merchant determines the duration of a cookie, also known as its \u201ccookie life.\u201d The most common length for an affiliate program is 30 days.

If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.</span><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Imagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don\u2019t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That\u2019s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It\u2019s like your computer\u2019s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called \u201cBit Gold.\u201d However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">So, What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:</b></span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain collects information in \u201cblocks\u201d.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blocks form chains, which are called \u201cBlockchains.\u201d</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>Let\u2019s get to know more about the blockchain.</b></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How does blockchain work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Here\u2019s how it works:</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Someone or a computer will transacts</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The transaction is transmitted throughout the network.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A network of computers can confirm the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a block</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The blocks are linked together to create a history.</span></li></ul><p></p>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">And that\u2019s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it\u2019s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.</span></li></ul><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How are Blockchains used?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been\u2014so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is Blockchain Decentralization?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology is safe, even if it\u2019s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called \u201cDecentralization,\u201d meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain guarantees your data's authenticity\u2014not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros and Cons of Blockchain</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Accuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Safe, private, and easy transactions</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Provides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal information</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Cons</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Data storage has limits.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It has a risk of being used for illicit activities&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Frequently Asked Questions About Blockchain</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">I\u2019ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is Blockchain a cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the most prominent blockchain company?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Who owns Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It\u2019s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency&nbsp;</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1) What is an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFT stands for non-fungible&nbsp; token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2) What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information\u2014such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts\u2014in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can\u2019t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3) What makes an NFT valuable?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br />\n</span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn\u2019t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4) How do NFTs work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can\u2019t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFTs also contain smart contracts\u2014small computer programs that run on the blockchain\u2014that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5) What\u2019s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you\u2019ll be able to upload and sell your creations</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain\u2014the bitcoin ledger of transactions\u2014and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10) How do we buy an NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">11) Can i mint NFT for free?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it?</span></h3>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Why are people investing so much in NFT?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><span>&nbsp;Non-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don\u2019t own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet.</span><br /></span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">That\u2019s a wrap.

Why is email marketing important?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email is the marketing tool that helps you&nbsp; create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak&nbsp; to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is benefits of email marketing?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email marketing is best way for creating long term relationship with your clients, and increasing sales in our company.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Benefits of email marketing for bussiness:</span></div><div><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Better brand recognition</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Statistics of what works best</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More sales</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Targeted audience</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More traffic to your products/services/newsletter</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Build credibility</span></li></ul></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Most&nbsp; bussinesses are using email marketing and making tons of money with email marketing.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Again, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be&nbsp; times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your&nbsp; data to decide.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;4. Which metrics should I be looking at?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The two most important metrics for email marketing are&nbsp; open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5. How do I write a decent subject line?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing&nbsp; the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for&nbsp; A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and&nbsp; simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,&nbsp; then repeated&nbsp; at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example \"Click here to download the premium theme for free.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><br />\n\n<br />6. Is email marketing still effective?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site&nbsp; hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans&nbsp; see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely&nbsp; see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span><br /></span><br />\n\n<br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Buying an email list is&nbsp; waste of time &amp; money. These email accounts are unverified and not interested in your brand. The mailing list is useless if your subscribers do not open your emails. There are different ways to grow your mailing list.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span>Give them a free ebook and host it on a landing page where they have to enter the email to download the file and also create a forum page on your website, asks your visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collects email addresses to follow up with them.</span><br />\n\n<br /></span></div>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a\"></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8. How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">If the&nbsp; subject line of the email is irrelevant to&nbsp; customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus&nbsp; on sales, offers and discounts.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Submit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers. You can also update them on recent trends in your industry. The basic role of an email is first and foremost to&nbsp; connect with customers, get the most out of this tool.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">9. What is the difference between a cold email and a spam email?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Cold emails are mostly sales emails that are sent with content align to the needs of the recipient. It is usually personalized and includes a business perspective. However, it is still an unsolicited email. And all unsolicited emails are marked as SPAM.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Regularly receiving this type of unsolicited email in your users' inboxes, chances are&nbsp; your emails will soon be diverted to&nbsp; spam or junk folders. The most important thing to prevent this from happening is to respect your recipients' choice to opt-out of receiving emails from you. You can add the links to easily unsubscribe. You must be familiar with the CAN-SPAM Act and its regulations.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10. Where can I find email template?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Almost all email campaign tools provide you with ready-made templates. Whether you use MailChimp or Pardot, you'll get several email templates ready to use.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;However, if you want to create a template from scratch, you can do so.Most of email campaign tools have option to paste the HTML code of your own design.&nbsp;</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br />11. What email marketing trend will help marketers succeed in 2022?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is it a trend to listen to&nbsp; and get to know your customers? I think people realize how bad it feels for a brand or a company to obsess over themselves without knowing their customers personal needs. People who listen empathetically and then provide value based on what they learn will win.</span></div></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span><br /></span><span>Final Saying</span></span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;You can approach email marketing in different ways.
