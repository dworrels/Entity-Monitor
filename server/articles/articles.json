    "description": "<p>The technology industry has always adored its improbably audacious goals and their associated buzzwords. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is among the most enamored. After all, the name \u201cMeta\u201d is the residue of his <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90691334/facebook-meta-new-name\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2021 rebranding</a> of the company formerly known as Facebook Inc. That was supposed to emphasize an utter commitment to building <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90843767/is-the-metaverse-already-dead\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the metaverse</a>\u2014an ambitious yet fuzzy concept blurring aspects of virtual reality, augmented reality, and social networking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Except Zuckerberg\u2019s goals have already drifted. Now he\u2019s all-in on attaining an advanced form of <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> called superintelligence. It\u2019s the focus of a new organization called <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/30/mark-zuckerberg-creating-meta-superintelligence-labs-read-the-memo.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Meta Superintelligence Labs</a>, which Meta is <a href=\"https://observer.com/2025/07/meta-superintellience-team-members/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stocking</a> with some of the planet\u2019s top AI talent. Whether the company is really dangling <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/meta-is-offering-multimillion-dollar-pay-for-ai-researchers-but-not-100m-signing-bonuses/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$100 million offers</a> to snag some potential recruits remains unclear. But MSL is led by Alexandr Wang, who joined Meta in June as part of a deal involving it <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/12/scale-ai-founder-wang-announces-exit-for-meta-part-of-14-billion-deal.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">investing $14 billion</a> in his startup, Scale AI\u2014an eye-watering sum all by itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term <em>superintelligence</em> isn\u2019t new (it was the title of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2014 book</a> by philosopher Nick Bostrom), but it may turn out to be 2025\u2019s buzzword of the year. A few more data points:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently <a href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">declared</a> that his company \u201cis a lot of things now, but before anything else, we are a superintelligence research company.\u201d </li>\n\n\n\n<li>One of Altman\u2019s OpenAI cofounders, famed AI scientist Ilya Sutskever, left a year ago to cofound a new startup called Safe Superintelligence, which just <a href=\"https://siliconangle.com/2025/07/03/safe-superintelligence-ceo-daniel-gross-joins-metas-new-ai-lab/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lost</a> another of its founders, Daniel Gross, to Meta\u2019s new lab. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Last month, when Microsoft said it had <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-medical-superintelligence-diagnosis/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">trained AI to diagnose disease</a> more accurately than doctors can, its AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, called the feat \u201ca genuine step toward medical superintelligence.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So what <em>is</em> superintelligence? In an <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/what-does-superintelligence-mean?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTY4OTY1OSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMjk0NDU5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVVBOEtUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIwNEFGQkMxQkYyMTA0NUVEODg3MzQxQkQwQzIyNzRBMCJ9.R5UZ4nIINm88RtT4nWbny1bWcVSd_8gCDV8b3wZoxio&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">excellent piece</a> on its emergence as a Silicon Valley obsession, Bloomberg\u2019s Shirin Ghaffary defines it as \u201cAI that is not just at parity with most people, but even better than all humans at all tasks.\u201d Ghaffary says the industry is gravitating toward superintelligence because it\u2019s a more tangible goal than artificial general intelligence, or AGI. <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91230713/the-future-according-to-google-deepmind-demis-hassabis-ai-agi-alphafold-alphago\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google DeepMind</a> chief AGI scientist Shane Legg, who popularized that term, defined it for me as \u201csomething that can at least match human capability in the sorts of cognitive tasks that people can typically do.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEven better than humans at all tasks\u201d would seem to be a substantially loftier ambition than merely \u201cmatching human capability\u201d in \u201ctasks that people can typically do.\u201d But <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-general-intelligence\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">over at IBM.com</a>, an article says we definitely <em>haven\u2019t</em> achieved AGI but arguably <em>have</em> achieved superintelligence. That\u2019s because the IBM piece\u2019s far less sweeping definition of superintelligence only involves it outperforming humans at certain jobs, not all of them. It cites four existing examples: IBM\u2019s own Deep Blue (chess) and Watson (<em>Jeopardy!</em>) along with Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo (Go) and AlphaFold (protein structure predictions).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this leaves me with more questions than answers:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If IBM\u2019s four examples aren\u2019t enough to confirm that superintelligence has been attained, how many would be? </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Who gets to decide what \u201cbetter than humans\u201d means? </li>\n\n\n\n<li>What happens if AI sails past humans on some fronts while remaining stubbornly behind on others? </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Don\u2019t many of our skills involve the ability to interact with the physical world, making surpassing them as much about robotics as software? (Meta is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/meta-plans-investments-into-ai-driven-humanoid-robots-memo-shows-2025-02-14/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">working on that</a>, too.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This we do know: Like AGI before it, superintelligence is inherently aspirational. It exists as a notion in part so that groups of people have something to race toward. In that sense, it bears some resemblance to past moonshots such as, well, NASA\u2019s Apollo program. The difference is that superintelligence offers no well-defined end point akin to landing a human being on the moon, which you\u2019ve either accomplished or you haven\u2019t. There will be no superintelligence equivalent of Neil Armstrong setting foot on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in March 2024, I <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91044103/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence-openai-gpt-4-musk-lawsuit\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> about the pointlessness of fixating on what AGI is and when it might be achieved. Swapping in superintelligence as fodder for this debate doesn\u2019t accomplish anything. Yes, we all need to gird ourselves for a world in which AI <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/05/28/anthropic-ceo-warning-ai-job-loss/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">competes with people for jobs</a>. I don\u2019t discount the possibility of it presenting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/10/ai-firms-urged-to-calculate-existential-threat-amid-fears-it-could-escape-human-control\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">existential risks</a> to humanity. It will unquestionably cause trouble of types yet to be identified. And\u2014fingers crossed\u2014it may help with some of our thorniest unsolved problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These points remain true no matter how you define superintelligence and regardless of whether it\u2019s ever reached. Which means that fixating on the race for it isn\u2019t a terribly <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/productivity\" title=\"Productivity\">productive</a> way of readying ourselves for AI\u2019s future impact on our lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, AI companies still have a spotty record at figuring out practical applications for AI in its present, less-than-superintelligent state. That\u2019s especially true for Meta, which has larded my Facebook feed with clueless <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91289861/facebook-ai-slop\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cMeta AI\u201d interjections</a> wholly incapable of grasping the conversations they\u2019re trying to join. Meta getting better at using the AI it already has would be an encouraging sign that its quest for superintelligence isn\u2019t just raw, unbridled ambition in search of actual useful purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You\u2019ve been reading </em>Plugged In, Fast Company<em>\u2019s weekly tech newsletter from me, global technology editor Harry McCracken.

    "description": "<p>From being the face of memestock mania to going viral for inadvertently stapling the screens of brand-new video game consoles, GameStop is no stranger to infamy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, during the midnight release of the highly anticipated <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91346893/nintendo-switch-2-review\">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, employees at GameStop&#8217;s Staten Island location punctured both the cardboard packaging and screens of some devices in a single motion\u2014while stapling customers\u2019 receipts. Although the company replaced the damaged devices, the incident quickly went viral on social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, in typical GameStop fashion, the company is selling what it calls &#8220;authentic relics from the now-infamous &#8216;Staplegate&#8217; incident,&#8221; launching an <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/388688595731\">eBay auction on July 9</a> starting at $1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes the universe hands you a stapler and says, \u2018Run with it.\u2019 So we did\u2014for a good cause,&#8221; a company spokesperson tells <em>Fast Company</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stapler in question is described in the listing as having &#8220;authentic field-use wear throughout.&#8221; In the spokesperson\u2019s words, \u201cThe stapler now stands as a retail legend born from a half-second decision.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of this writing, the listing had received more than 200 bids, the highest reaching $122,800. According to the company, all proceeds will be donated to Children\u2019s Miracle Network Hospitals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the stapler, the listing includes &#8220;the first known console to be officially stapled during a product launch by GameStop,&#8221; the stapled box, the removed single staple, and a certificate of authenticity signed by GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The auction aligns with GameStop\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91307385/gamestop-shares-fall-after-bitcoin-investment-plan\">history of unconventional decisions</a>\u2014including the announcement earlier this year that the company would <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91306272/gamestop-invests-in-crypto-board-votes-for-bitcoin-treasury-reserve-asset\">invest its cash</a>, equity issuances, and future debt into Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The listing gained nearly 250,000 views within its first 24 hours and is rapidly gaining traction on social media, in part due to comments made by the CEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If this reaches six figures I will include my underwear,&#8221; <a href=\"https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1943032530736714175\">Cohen said on X</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the listing surpassed $100,000, he <a href=\"https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1943325564682539422\">promised another \u201cprize\u201d:</a> &#8220;If this reaches seven figures I will fly the winner to Miami, take them to McDonald\u2019s for lunch and personally deliver my preowned underwear.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users on social media have flooded the post\u2019s comment section, sharing <a href=\"https://x.com/koip741/status/1943357701872062492\">AI-generated images</a> of the proposed transaction and asking questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Important detail needed: Used or laundered?&#8221; one person replied on X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As to the state of the CEO\u2019s undergarments, the GameStop spokesperson tells <em>Fast Company</em>: &#8220;The winner will have to find out.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<hr />",

    "description": "<p>Chinese <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/evs\" title=\"EVs\">electric vehicle</a> giant BYD claims it has delivered what Elon Musk has promised forever but has failed to deliver again and again: a car that can park itself with full Level 4 (L4) autonomy. That means that the car can navigate a parking lot, find a spot, and park completely unattended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some cars have assisted parking, including brands like BMW, Nissan, and Tesla, but none offers total autonomy except Mercedes-Benz. The latter is only a very limited L4 parking test confined to a single airport parking lot in Stuttgart, Germany, with special equipment installed. BYD&#8217;s system operates outside dedicated structures and is not restricted to pre-mapped locations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is so confident in the technology that it announced that it will cover any damages to your car or any other vehicle if things go wrong. This means if anything happens, the owner won\u2019t have to file a claim and have their premiums go up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The breakthrough comes with the latest over-the-air update of BYD&#8217;s \u201cGod&#8217;s Eye\u201d intelligent driving system, which now numbers more than 1 million cars across China. There\u2019s no word when it will come to other markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-eye-that-sees-it-all\"><strong>The eye that sees it all</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BYD&#8217;s confidence stems from a sophisticated sensor architecture. The God&#8217;s Eye system deploys multiple sensing technologies working in concert, unlike Tesla&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91299741/tesla-self-driving-mark-rober\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">problematic camera-only approach</a>. Even the <a href=\"https://carnewschina.com/2025/02/10/byd-released-the-new-gods-eye-driving-assistance-system/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">entry-level God&#8217;s Eye C variant</a>\u2014one of three autonomous driving levels included in most affordable models\u2014includes 12 cameras, 5 millimeter-wave radars, and 12 ultrasonic sensors with 1-centimeter accuracy. The mid-tier God&#8217;s Eye B adds a lidar sensor, while the premium God&#8217;s Eye A variant features three lidar sensors for maximum precision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system&#8217;s parking accuracy allows the car to get within 0.8 inches of other objects, enabled by multiple redundant sensors that create a three-dimensional map. This allows the vehicle a deep understanding of its environment. This multi-sensor approach allows the system to detect obstacles. It can even recognize hanging objects over the roof line of the car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company reports that more than 1 million vehicles now carry the God&#8217;s Eye system, an impressive deployment scale that starts with the most inexpensive models, like the $9,550 BYD Seagull, and go all the way to the $236,000 BYD Yangwang U9, a hypercar that can detect potholes on the road and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIKAn8yDkpA\">jump over them</a>. Yes. If the God\u2019s Eye detects an obstacle on the road, it will literally jump over it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mercedes-Benz is the only company that approaches BYD\u2019s new ability, and it only does so by cheating. Working with German hardware maker Bosch, it achieved L4 parking certification <a href=\"https://autobuzz.my/2022/12/02/mercedes-benz-and-bosch-debut-worlds-first-l4-driverless-valet-parking-to-help-you-save-time/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in 2022</a>. But the automaker&#8217;s system operates exclusively in the P6 parking garage at Stuttgart Airport, requiring specific infrastructure and limiting availability to select S-Class and EQS models. Drivers must book parking spaces through the Mercedes Me app and drop off vehicles in designated zones, making the system more of a controlled experiment than practical technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if Mercedes could extend the idea to other parking lots throughout the world\u2014which seem impractical\u2014this approach lacks the flexibility and scalability of BYD&#8217;s vehicle-centric solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BMW and other premium automakers offer advanced parking assistance but remain stuck at Level 2 automation. BMW&#8217;s Parking Assistant Professional can perform parallel and perpendicular parking, but requires constant driver supervision and cannot achieve true autonomous operation. The system includes features like remote control parking and recorded path memory, but falls short of the true hands-off capability that defines L4 autonomy, which BYD is claiming with its new God\u2019s Eye update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chinese manufacturers are heavily investing in <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> capabilities for their cars. BYD Chairman Wang Chuanfu claims that it has 5,000 AI engineers working exclusively on solving full L4 autonomy. Companies like Baidu (whose open-source autonomous driving system Apollo is used by Volvo), Xiaomi, and Xpeng, are on similar paths. Chuanfu believes that God\u2019s Eyes will provide full L4 in the next two to three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tesla-s-falling-way-behind\"><strong>Tesla&#8217;s falling way behind</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But perhaps the technology gap is more obvious when you compare it to Tesla which has been claiming full autonomous driving \u201cnext year\u201d for the last seven years. While BYD and the other Chinese manufacturers deploy multiple sensor types for redundancy and accuracy, Musk decided that Tesla should abandon ultrasonic sensors in favor of cameras alone, creating dangerous blind spots and unreliable distance measurements. There have been <a href=\"https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/berks/tesla-sedan-hit-by-train-after-self-driving-error-in-berks-county-stops-train-traffic/article_aa1cbbf4-7918-4379-b557-da80f9596103.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpARr8DVU2M\">reports</a> of Tesla autonomous driving <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mnG_Gbxf_w\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">problems</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like BMW and Mercedes, Tesla has a basic parking assist feature, too.

Musk&#8217;s dismissal of lidar as &#8220;a crutch&#8221; and &#8220;loser&#8217;s technology&#8221; has clearly left Tesla technologically behind competitors who have embraced multi-sensor approaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BYD&#8217;s L4 parking achievement and its financial guarantee shows who the real loser is here. Not only Musk, but the entire Western automobile industry. As Ford\u2019s CEO Jim Farley <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIUfbpK3yBQ\">told the audience</a> at the Aspen Ideas Summit last month talking about his last visit to China: \u201cIt\u2019s the most humbling thing I\u2019ve ever seen . . . their cost, their quality of their vehicles is far superior to what I see in the West. We are in a global competition with China, and it\u2019s not just EVs. And if we lose this, we do not have a future at Ford.\u201d Ford and everyone else, I\u2019m afraid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

    "description": "<p>The steam engine in the 19th century, the microprocessor chip in the 20th\u2014companies that figured out how to use them thrived; those that didn\u2019t declined. And now the race to embrace <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> is on. <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work\">McKinsey estimates</a> the potential for corporates to grow their <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/productivity\" title=\"Productivity\">productivity</a> through this transformative technology at $4.4 trillion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s corporate leaders are acutely aware of this\u2014only 1% call their companies \u201cmature\u201d on the deployment spectrum\u2014and they certainly want to do something about this: 92% plan to increase their AI investments over the next three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in the rush to embed AI, these leaders are missing, and even contributing to, a far greater issue than slow AI uptake: a disconnect between leadership and their workforce, leading to the erosion of alignment and trust inside organizations. This cultural disconnect is a far more urgent risk to business performance than technical lag.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how to tackle this mounting challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-problems-with-a-disconnected-workforce\">The problems with a disconnected workforce</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx?utm_source=state_of_the_global_workplace&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=sogw_2025_launch_reminder_emea_4c_april_20250430&amp;utm_term=information&amp;utm_content=download_report_cta_1\">Gallup&#8217;s 2025 State of the Global Workforce</a> revealed that global employee engagement declined to 21% in 2024, only the second decline in engagement in the past 12 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ought to alarm business leaders. Disengaged employees are a huge threat in multiple ways. They do the bare minimum work: studies show disengaged employees are 18% less productive on average.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next consider the impact on the customer experience. Disengagement isn\u2019t contained, it leaks, and disengaged employees are likely to lower service quality, slow response times, and diminish brand loyalty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disengaged employees also kill innovation, problem-solving, and transformation. They don\u2019t speak up, challenge ideas, or contribute proactively. They don\u2019t resist loudly. They comply quietly via passive resistance. You lose not just output, but the critical energy that drives adaptation and progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then they leave. Disengaged employees are 2.6 times more likely to actively seek a new job, creating costly churn. Gallup estimates the cost of replacing an employee is 150% of their salary. But before they go, many poison the culture from within, turning previously engaged employees into disengaged ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Disengaged workforce&#8221; is a term that gets thrown around a lot by people functions, and too often its dismissed by leadership as HR fluff. But when you connect it to hard facts, it really is like death by a thousand invisible cuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-the-disconnection-accelerator\">AI: the disconnection accelerator</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While this disconnect silently eats away at the corporate world, execs blindly plow on with AI implementation, and in doing so are making the issue far worse. <a href=\"https://investors.upwork.com/news-releases/news-release-details/upwork-study-finds-employee-workloads-rising-despite-increased-c\">A study of 2,500 workers</a> from the U.S., U.K., and Australia revealed that for 77% of employees AI has increased their workload, with one in three full-time employees saying they will likely quit their jobs in the next six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\u2019re not imagining the increased workload: 81% of global C-suite leaders acknowledge they have increased demands on their workers in the past year.&nbsp;With AI there is just more pressure to deliver more, faster, in less amount of time, and the relationship between employees and employers is eroding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://mertbulan.com/2025/01/26/once-you-are-laid-off-you-will-never-be-the-same-again/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">one commentator recently put it</a>: \u201cCompanies are announcing layoffs alongside record-breaking financial results. You work hard, focus on impactful projects, and receive praise from your lead\u2014only to find yourself let go by someone who likely doesn\u2019t even know you exist. It feels as though the trust between companies and employees is now broken. Companies, it seems, are either unaware of this shift or unwilling to address it. And frankly, I\u2019m not sure how they could fix it.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-slow-down-and-listen\">Slow down and listen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>They can fix this. But first, leadership needs to take its foot off the gas. Because if you want AI transformation to succeed, your people need to come with you. And that starts by returning to the roots of effective employee engagement: human insight, gained the human way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s about spending real time understanding the lived, felt, experienced reality of your workforce\u2014ironically, the kind of research AI can\u2019t replicate. Because while technology can summarize patterns, it can\u2019t observe culture in motion. It can\u2019t pick up on tension in a room. It can\u2019t notice who\u2019s talking, who isn\u2019t, and why. It can\u2019t notice your tiny invisible cuts forming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the approach of Dell which in 2024, imposed rigid return-to-office mandates, introduced employee monitoring, and fast-tracked GenAI, all with minimal listening to its employees. The result? Internal backlash, tanking morale, and public employer brand damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrast it with Toyota which has built its leadership philosophy around <em>Genchi Genbutsu</em>\u2014&#8221;go and see.\u201d Leaders embed, observe, and critically, understand before deciding. It\u2019s a major reason why it remains the world\u2019s leading car brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-connection-and-understanding\">Connection and understanding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From there it\u2019s about rebuilding connection. Be authentic: own the challenges, and remember that people respect honesty over perfection. Surface and elevate the true human insights that come from the front lines. Then close the loop: when people see changes made from their input, trust grows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crucially, leaders need to recognise that while AI can help scale tasks, only they, the leaders, can scale trust. And they\u2019ll build it by realising that people still come first, AI second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organizations that win in the AI era won\u2019t be the ones that move the fastest. They\u2019ll be the ones that stay closest to the ground. This isn&#8217;t a nostalgic plea for \u201cpre-AI\u201d leadership. It\u2019s a call on leaders to simply do better, by showing through actions, not words, that they are something AI can never be: human.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

    "description": "<p>When it comes to the future of urban mobility, it\u2019s not the sci-fi fantasies that will shape our cities. It\u2019s functional solutions for the everyday. While tech visionaries promote high-speed concepts like <a href=\"https://interestingengineering.com/transportation/futuristic-tubes-can-take-from-new-york-to-beijing-just-2-hours\">ET3\u2019s vacuum-sealed capsules, </a>true transformation will come from transportation solutions that are accessible, reliable, and affordable\u2014like modernizing existing transit infrastructure, digitizing bus routes, and reducing traffic congestion. Sexy, futuristic modes of transportation like autonomous vehicles may dominate the headlines, but what Americans really crave are reliable, inexpensive options to get them from point A to point B\u2014not a self-driving car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public frustration around the future of transit is mounting. <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-05-14/waymo-recalls-more-than-1-200-automated-vehicles-after-minor-crashes\">Waymos are crashing in Los Angeles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/nyregion/congestion-pricing-video-trump.html\">congestion pricing is contentious in New York City</a>, and the U.S. lacks a reliable high-speed rail network. These realities make it clear that companies should rethink what the \u201ccity of the future\u201d looks like and reprioritize achievable solutions to real needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://diffusionpr.com/us/diffusion-pr-urban-mobility-report/\">New data</a> from Censuswide, commissioned by Diffusion, offers a closer look at the evolving sentiment on mobility in America\u2019s biggest cities\u2014and the findings highlight a pressing need for better solutions. Alarmingly, <a href=\"https://diffusionpr.com/us/diffusion-pr-urban-mobility-report/\">fewer than 18% of Americans describe their city\u2019s transit as \u201chighly efficient\u201d and nearly as many say it\u2019s \u201cstruggling.\u201d</a> &nbsp;With American people driving around <a href=\"https://frontiergroup.org/resources/fact-file-americans-drive-most/\">twice as much annually compared to their European counterparts</a>, the overreliance on personal vehicles underscores the urgency for investments in reliable public transit that can reduce congestion, cut emissions and improve quality of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While exciting, the novelty of new mobility tech, like the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-04-10/doordash-rolls-out-food-delivery-robots-in-los-angeles\">2,000 new food delivery bots roaming around Los Angeles</a>, wears off quickly when residents can depend more on their takeout delivery than the bus they take to work. In fact, bus delays are collectively costing<a href=\"https://ktla.com/news/local-news/bus-delays-cost-angelenos-a-decade-each-day-streets-for-all/\"> L.A. residents more than a cumulative decade on the average weekday</a>. Despite the ability to ask ChatGPT nearly any question and get the answer in seconds, Americans are understandably frustrated that they can\u2019t seem to get an accurate transit schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-back-to-the-basics\">Back to the basics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The top three priorities for Americans when it comes to urban mobility are affordability (50.8%), reliable public transit (47%), and accessibility (39.3%)\u2014 demonstrating a need for options that reduce traffic congestion, provide economical alternatives, and are available to all. Visionaries in the urban mobility space need to focus on these core components before setting their sights on mass adoption. Without demonstrating a positive potential impact on cost, convenience, reliability, and ease of use, companies innovating in the space will only continue to be met with skepticism and resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fears-around-av\">Fears around AV</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sentiment around automated vehicles (AVs), for example, perfectly illustrates the increasing skepticism and resistance to adapt. Despite AVs being at the forefront of the future and modern urban transit conversation, the public isn\u2019t on board, with over half (50.5%) of respondents disagreeing that AV\u2019s are the \u201cfuture.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, 74.5% of Americans said they don\u2019t trust the safety of AVs and 66% said that the technology isn\u2019t ready. Yet just this month, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/18/business/waymo-new-york-city\">Waymo announced they are expanding to New York City</a>. This move suggests that companies in the urban mobility space may be out of touch with what American commuters are ready to embrace. AVs still don\u2019t feel normal or comfortable to most, so now is the time to build trust. Rolling them out at scale without addressing fundamental mobility concerns risks missing the mark entirely, since commuters need confidence in the safety and reliability of the technology before they\u2019ll consider taking the risk themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond issues of trust and comfort, however, concerns extend to the broader economic impact of AVs. Nearly 60% said they\u2019re concerned about AVs impact on jobs, a sentiment that isn\u2019t surprising given growing fears about <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a>\u2019s effects on the American workforce and the <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/05/28/anthropic-ceo-warning-ai-job-loss/\">disappearance of certain roles</a>. While businesses race to advance AV technology, assuming widespread excitement for futuristic transportation options, they often overlook how these developments will directly affect everyday people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Job loss is not the only aspect of new technology that concerns Americans\u2014privacy remains at the forefront of conversation, with over 60% of people reporting a concern for their digital safety. Many of these \u201cfuturistic\u201d transport options require a certain amount of data about oneself, location, etc. which can be scary to the everyday commuter. Companies modernizing urban mobility should focus on transparency when it comes to data collection, to help ease user\u2019s minds, and highlight the ways in which their technology will tangibly improve day-to-day lives. Otherwise, they\u2019ll face resistance in the pursuit of mass acceptance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-real-city-of-the-future\">The real &#8216;City of the Future&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since what Americans truly want isn\u2019t flying cars or futuristic cities, efforts should focus on enhancing existing infrastructure through smart technology instead of pursuing a complete overhaul. Innovations that fail to get someone to their destination quickly and affordably are far less \u201ctransformative\u201d than companies believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real future of urban mobility isn\u2019t about who has the flashiest new system, it\u2019s about who solves the real problems. \u201cProgress\u201d is about improving upon how people live, work and move within cities, not making headlines for futuristic features that don\u2019t have real-world impact. Before we prioritize the \u201ccity of the future,\u201d let\u2019s strengthen our cities in the present.</p>",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91364481/what-is-fractional-leadership-and-why-is-it-booming-now",
    "description": "<p>More and more senior executives are stepping out of high-powered roles and opting to work for multiple companies on an access pay-as-you-go basis as fractional leaders. This raises the question:&nbsp;Why are executives taking this step, and why is it booming now?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Post-pandemic shifts have altered how senior leadership thinks about time, value, and work. The profound shift in how we worked allowed senior leaders to reflect on their lives. It also encouraged more reflection, which gave rise to a desire to have more <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91289251/strategies-leaders-create-meaningful-work-culture\">meaningful and purposeful work</a>. It fostered a sense of agency\u2014to decide what work they do, when, and with whom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-rise-of-fractional-leadership\">The rise of fractional leadership</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As leaders sought to regain more control over their working lives, many viewed <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91353298/personalized-employee-experiences-are-the-future-of-work-heres-how-your-business-can-deliver-them\">fractional leadership</a> as the logical next step to achieve this freedom in their careers. But what is fractional leadership\u2014and why is it still gaining momentum?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fractional leaders work in part-time, high-impact roles across multiple companies. They are self-employed and operate on an access pay-as-you-go basis, often supporting a portfolio of organizations and adjusting their support based on each company&#8217;s needs at any given time. They frequently sit at the head of various functions, such as finance, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketing</a>, or technology. Organizations often <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/hiring\" title=\"Hiring\">hire</a> them to help grow the company during stages when it doesn\u2019t require a full-time leader in that area.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most fractional leaders have previously held full-time C-suite positions, but have transitioned into fractional roles while seeking more purpose and autonomy. For some, it&#8217;s the allure of a better <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91071905/ditching-grind-work-life-balance-success\">work-life balance</a> and no longer being tied to the nine-to-five. They want to work around family priorities and travel desires. For others, the variety offered by fractional work is appealing. Working with three to seven businesses at exciting stages of growth can provide more challenge and excitement than some full-time roles. Typically, fractional leaders have long careers in full-time C-suite roles, but fractional work offers them the chance to make a positive impact on growing small to medium-sized businesses. They feel like they can have a greater impact on a small organization than within the constraints of a large corporation.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-is-the-fractional-boom-in-the-c-suite-happening-now\">Why is the fractional boom in the C-suite happening now?\u00a0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of the C-suite has remained largely unchanged since the 1980s. Many view it as a static structure. However, we\u2019re now facing a seismic shift as global megatrends begin to reshape how we work. Adopting experienced, agile leaders may be essential for businesses navigating challenges like climate change, political and economic instability, demographic shifts, and energy scarcity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fractional leadership allows businesses to be more agile by accessing the skills needed to address these megatrends. This includes bringing in leaders with experience in managing new technological changes, like <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91341874/why-companies-implementing-agentic-ai-before-proper-governance-will-end-up-behind-not-ahead-of-the-curve-implementing-agentic-ai\">AI implementation</a>. Most fractional leaders also have access to a network of peers who can help inform decision-making when responding to global challenges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fractional leadership has grown from the realization that full-time presence in an office isn&#8217;t always necessary to perform valuable and important work. A few years ago, many companies were reluctant to hire leaders who couldn\u2019t be physically present daily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with efforts to return-to-office mandates, the modern workplace has demonstrated that presence doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to impact. Fractional leaders will mirror the culture of each business they work with to build trust and rapport. That might mean being onsite regularly with those full-time back in the office, to matching a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91122228/hybrid-work-needs-a-performance-review\">hybrid or remote work structure</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, we\u2019ve seen the rise of the independent contractor economy. Small businesses have tapped this model for services like design, marketing, and accounting. The idea isn&#8217;t new. Fractional leadership is the next evolution of this trend. It will enable businesses to access the right talent at the right time to support growth without the overhead of a full-time hire but through a committed relationship for as long as the business needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This shift is also influenced by advancements in technology, which facilitate unbundling traditional job roles. Organizations are adopting more adaptive, problem-focused work models instead of conventional job-centric thinking. Fractional leadership provides the opportunity to outsource these unbundled roles, providing businesses with access to dynamic, fit-for-purpose skill sets. It will also allow senior leaders to integrate work with their personal lives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-future-of-work-with-fractional-leaders-nbsp\">The future of work with fractional leaders?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, we are witnessing the rise of a blended workforce. It\u2019s no longer the norm to be a full-time employee working nine-to-five, five days a week in a physical office. Instead, the workforce comprises employees, fractional leaders, project freelancers, and gig economy workers\u2014all contributing valuable work.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The onset of <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> is only going to accelerate this trend of unbundling roles. Fractional leaders will be ahead of these trends, from working with multiple companies, they\u2019ll be able to help businesses prioritize the human skills needed to grow a business alongside this blended future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While businesses rely on fractional leaders, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90847166/laid-off-6-reasons-to-become-an-independent-contractor\">freelancers, and gig economy workers</a>, the next question for businesses to tackle is how to shift their thinking from leading their employees to leading their whole blended workforce effectively. If they can learn to do this, business leaders can look forward to a more agile and nimble workforce to weather the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

    "title": "What\u2019s your investment psychology?",
    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91365837/whats-your-investment-psychology",
    "description": "<p>Douglas Adams\u2019 brilliant novel <em>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</em> describes Milliways, the fine dining establishment built in a time bubble and projected forward to the precise moment of the End of the Universe. Meals at such a singular restaurant are ridiculously expensive\u2013but diners can easily pay for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAll you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings account in your own era, and when you arrive at the End of Time, the operation of compound interest means that the fabulous cost of your meal has been paid for,\u201d Adams wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I read this novel as an impressionable 12-year-old, the Milliways-approved investing process appealed to me. With a little bit of money and a whole lot of time, compound interest could do the work for me while I sat back and looked forward to a truly world-shattering meal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was reminded of this recently when my spouse asked if the investment decisions we had set-and-forget several years before were maximizing our returns. Instead of jumping at the chance to ensure our finances were living up to their potential, I was annoyed at the prospect of having to make changes to a system I\u2019d already set up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until that moment, I thought I had a handle on <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91206932/heres-the-science-behind-our-stupid-money-mistakes\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">my financial psychology</a>. But apparently, I have some quirks of investment psychology that I wasn\u2019t even aware of. As do you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how your investment psychology may be misdirecting your investing decisions\u2014and what you can do to get back on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-investment-psychology\"><a></a>What is investment psychology?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although we think of finance and investing as a \u201crational\u201d activity, we are likely to react emotionally to money. This is partially because of mental shortcuts known as <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-cognitive-bias-2794963\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cognitive biases</a>. These are systematic patterns in thinking that can lead us to irrational decisions or behavior that runs counter to our goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, my preference to set-and-forget my investments is partially due to a cognitive bias known as the <a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/status-quo-bias\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">status quo bias</a>. This cognitive bias describes a preference for the current state of affairs to remain the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t like to think of myself as a stick in the mud, and I could have given my spouse a rational-sounding reason why I don\u2019t double check that our investments are maximized. But I can see that my lack of interest in revisiting old decisions reflects something about my investing psychology: I prefer to make a decision once and stick to it. That\u2019s the specific aspect of the status quo that I don\u2019t want to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This preference for once-and-done decision making isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but it can cost me. If my spouse hadn\u2019t asked about our returns, I never would have thought to check and we could have lost years\u2019 worth of potential returns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this experience, my spouse and I have realized that he needs to occasionally nudge me to check back on old investing decisions. That will help me avoid the complacency of my status quo bias.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-common-investment-psychology-biases\"><a></a>Common investment psychology biases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of cognitive biases that may be keeping your investments from growing. Which of these biases sound like you?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-action-bias\"><a></a>Action bias</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/action-bias\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">action bias</a> could be seen as the opposite of the status quo bias. If you have this cognitive quirk, you will feel the need to do something\u2013<em>anything!</em>\u2013rather than nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your portfolio drops in value, your action bias might lead you to sell in order to avoid a larger loss. Unfortunately, taking action at that time is often the worst option, since most losses are temporary, and selling makes the loss permanent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid the action bias, commit to waiting 24 to 48 hours before taking any action with your portfolio. This will give the market some time to recover from momentary dips, and will not make a significant difference if action is called for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, find a trusted adviser or friend who can help you determine when action or inaction is appropriate. This can help keep you from developing an itchy trading finger.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-disposition-effect\"><a></a>Disposition effect</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This cognitive bias describes the phenomenon where investors tend to sell a winning investment too soon while holding onto a tanking investment for too long. When you are experiencing the <a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/disposition-effect\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">disposition effect</a>, which combines a fear of losing out (in case the tanking investment suddenly goes gangbusters) plus a fear of regret (in case the winning investment takes a dive), you are trying to hedge your losses in both directions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But evidence has shown that selling the losing investment and holding onto the winning investment is the smarter strategy. The disposition effect is making an emotional decision to hedge loss, rather than a rational choice to try to maximize your returns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers have found the best way to avoid the disposition effect is to implement long-term investment goals. Investors with a clear financial target not only successfully avoid the disposition effect, but they exhibit a reversal of the effect, selling the losing investments and keeping the winners.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-familiarity-bias\"><a></a>Familiarity bias</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Also known as the <a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/mere-exposure-effect\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">mere exposure effect</a>, this cognitive bias leads investors to overinvest in assets they are familiar with. Specifically, American investors are more likely to put their money in domestic stocks, bonds, and funds, rather than getting international exposure in their portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The familiarity bias can go even further, with investors buying shares of companies they recognize, or even the company that employs them. (You might remember that Lehman Brothers\u2019 employees owned <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lehman-shares-are-wasted-on-lehman-bankers/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">30% of the company\u2019s shares</a> at the time of the bank\u2019s collapse.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But just because an investor is familiar with an asset doesn\u2019t make it the right investment for their portfolio. Diversification is typically the best way of combatting the familiarity bias. This may require the help of a financial adviser if you don\u2019t feel comfortable picking diverse international investments or other assets outside of your sphere of exposure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-don-t-panic-a-rational-guide-to-investing\"><a></a>Don\u2019t panic: a rational guide to investing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Humans aren\u2019t great at making rational investment decisions, but we\u2019re very good at lying to ourselves about that fact. To improve your investment choices\u2014not to mention your returns\u2014start by recognizing the ways in which your investing psychology may be leading you astray.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps, like me, you suffer from the status quo bias, and prefer to avoid revisiting any decisions you\u2019ve already made. Or you might experience the opposite quirk, the action bias, which tells you to <em>do something!</em> anytime there is the slightest movement in your portfolio. You may fall victim to the disposition effect, where you hold onto a stinker and sell a winner, despite it being a losing strategy. Or you might just stick with the familiar companies, asset classes, and investments you know, rather than diversifying your portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the good news: once you know your brain is taking these shortcuts, you\u2019re better prepared to avoid them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for me, I\u2019m still keeping my Milliways savings account open. I\u2019ve got the time.</p>",

This is particularly powerful for people\u2014like me\u2014who think out loud.

Get the AI to interview you, rather than interviewing it. Give it a little context and what you&#8217;re focusing on and what you&#8217;re interested in, and then you ask it to interview you to elicit your own insights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach helps extract knowledge from yourself, not just from the AI. Sometimes we need that guide to pull ideas out of ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-assisted-planning\">AI-assisted planning</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is particularly helpful for strategic planning. Try this: create a Claude Project\u2014or a ChatGPT Project\u2014and detail for your AI assistant your objectives and operating context. Have it help you think through a plan for the next month based on your goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit is comprehensive thinking. Our planning falls short when we&#8217;ve left something out. We&#8217;ve forgotten to consider various factors or haven&#8217;t fully analyzed how things could go wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-identify-writing-weaknesses\">Identify writing weaknesses</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Give an AI assistant like\u00a0<a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/\">Gemini</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://copilot.ai/\">Copilot</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://claude.ai/\">Claude</a>,\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\">ChatGPT</a>\u00a0text you&#8217;ve written, with a prompt asking for specific feedback. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ask for questions your writing should answer but doesn\u2019t yet.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prompt for a blind spot or a key point a critic might say you\u2019ve missed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tell your AI aid to point out a section of your text that\u2019s boring or bland.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach elevates your work. In this paradigm, your assistant isn\u2019t writing for you. It&#8217;s giving you objective feedback on your work and helping you strengthen your own eye for edits. It\u2019s pushing you to reach a higher standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article is republished with permission from&nbsp;</em>Wonder Tools<em>,&nbsp;a newsletter that helps you discover the most useful sites and apps.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wondertools.substack.com/subscribe\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wondertools.substack.com/p/9-useful-ai-prompts\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://wondertools.substack.com/p/9-useful-ai-prompts\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nEq8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1dc5ed12-6d20-4b88-b24b-fe0adc83b4d3_2922x796.png\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wlDE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F977ab892-378b-4c8e-b9aa-746e05f5b3c1_2958x990.png\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>",

    "description": "<p>Every technological revolution brings with it management change. The rise of automation in the 1980s, for example, led to process reengineering (stripping out unnecessary steps to shorten timelines). Now with the dawn of <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a>, the next wave of organizational and leadership change is upon us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Carucci, a consultant and researcher on leadership and organizations, and Kathleen Hogan, Microsoft\u2019s former chief people officer and its newly appointed EVP of the Office of Strategy and Transformation, have identified what they believe are four of the most fundamental shifts that leaders and organizations must consider to be\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91183179/how-ready-are-you-for-an-unpredictable-tech-future\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">future-ready</a>. <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/subscribe?utm_source=dek&amp;utm_medium=lander&amp;utm_campaign=main&amp;postID=premiumLander\">Paid subscribers</a> will learn:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>How to redefine career progression by impact, not rank</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The most important trait that talent teams need to look for when <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/hiring\" title=\"Hiring\">hiring</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Why AI will render the org chart a thing of the past</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The three things Microsoft is looking for from every manager to train future leaders</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-from-change-management-to-change-readiness\">1. From change management to change readiness</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Less than a decade ago, best practices in <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91028625/embracing-the-winds-of-change-the-odyssey-in-change-management\">change management</a> involved carefully structured communication and stakeholder plans, phased rollouts with meticulous timelines, and well-resourced implementation strategies. This approach was built on the assumption that leaders knew in advance both the changes they needed to make and the precise destination they wanted to reach. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But today, change arrives so quickly that there is often no time to define a fixed endpoint\u2014let alone build a road map to get there. The new reality requires a shift from managing change as a project to developing a culture where change-readiness is an everyday capability.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create this shift, leaders must first embrace a change-ready mindset\u2014one that sees change as a continuous state rather than a series of isolated events. This means hiring and developing employees based on their ability to learn and adapt, not just their current expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;At Microsoft, being a \u201cpositive pivoter\u201d means embracing change as the new norm instead of seeing it as a hardship. This means rewarding adaptability and resilience, shifting away from valuing stability\u2014keeping things under \u201ccontrol\u201d\u2014as the ultimate leadership virtue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond mindset, leaders must also empower employees to actively drive change rather than passively waiting for direction. Rather than managing change top-down, leaders should coach employees to anticipate and shape it. This requires breaking down rigid structures and creating cross-functional teams that identify disruptions early and respond with agility. Finally, organizations must embed change as an everyday practice rather than a temporary initiative. Leaders should normalize experimentation and foster learning from failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Microsoft, leaders have been prepared for this under <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40457458/satya-nadella-rewrites-microsofts-code\">Satya</a> <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90940348/microsoft-history-fast-company-satya-nadella-interview-cover-story\">Nadella</a>, where challenging one\u2019s fixed mindset is a daily habit.&nbsp;For example, as Microsoft wrestled with how to win in AI, we had to challenge the fixed mindset that we had all the answers. When we <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40457741/satya-nadella-the-c-in-ceo-stands-for-culture\">shifted</a> to a growth mindset we embraced the opportunity to bring in outside perspectives and ideas. In the last year we\u2019ve added three new <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91282404/mustafa-suleyman-microsoft-ai\">externally hired executives</a> to Satya\u2019s leadership team to enable the push into AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-from-hierarchical-leadership-to-agile-networks\">2. From hierarchical leadership to agile networks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, organizations relied on well-defined hierarchies where leadership influence was dictated by reporting lines, and decision-making authority was concentrated at the top. This model created stability, but at the cost of agility, as decisions had to travel up and down a chain of command before action could be taken. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In today\u2019s fast-moving environment this rigid structure has become a liability. The future demands a shift toward agile, networked leadership, where decision-making is based on expertise, not hierarchy, and teams dynamically form and reform to tackle challenges as they arise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To build this new model of leadership, organizations must move beyond traditional org charts to foster fluid, networked governance structures. One organization Ron consulted with, developed innovation hubs focused on specific product and customer segments. Each cross-functional group was assigned a specific innovation focus, given resources, and empowered to make \u201cgo-no go\u201d decisions on their projects right up until prelaunch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This dramatically reduced the time it took to complete projects because it eliminated relying on hierarchical decision-making for approvals. In one year, they increased their successful product launches by 46%.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-from-leadership-as-control-to-leadership-as-coaching-nbsp\">3. From leadership as control to leadership as coaching&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For decades, leadership was synonymous with creating order from chaos. The assumption was that strong leadership meant exerting control over ambiguity. However, today, uncertainty is no longer an occasional disruption, but a constant state.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Future-ready leaders must embrace uncertainty and develop coaching mindsets to help employees navigate complexity with confidence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This shift begins with redefining leadership as coaching rather than controlling. Replace rigid performance reviews with real-time feedback that drives continuous improvement. Balance accountability with empathy, ensuring that expectations remain high (with clear measurable goals) while employees feel psychologically safe to take risks, experiment, and grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft has declared this year of intensified uncertainty and transformation as the \u201cyear of the coach.\u201d Microsoft has identified three competencies\u2014model, coach, care\u2014as foundational to managers at all levels. We\u2019ve learned candid coaching is care. Role modeling what it means to give thoughtful, clear feedback as well as acknowledging personal shortfalls earns the permission to candidly coach.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All people managers will have access to communities with tools and training to improve their coaching skills. They will also be able to exchange feedback. This will be particularly critical as AI agents become a regular part of managerial life.&nbsp; Managers will need to understand how to coach people to harness irreplaceable human assets like relationship building, empathy, and creativity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equipping leaders with strong coaching skills is essential in this new paradigm. This means training managers to ask the right questions rather than simply providing answers. It also requires setting and exceeding the bar for meeting customers\u2019 evolving needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-from-status-as-power-currency-to-contribution-as-impact-currency\">4. From status as power currency to contribution as impact currency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In many organizations, career progression has long been tied to status, measured by titles, reporting structures, team size, and invitations to high-level meetings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees have traditionally viewed promotions as the primary means of increasing their impact. But in an era where speed, collaboration, and expertise matter over rank, the future of leadership must be based on influence and contribution, rather than job titles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create this shift, companies must redefine career growth and progression by rewarding employees for impact rather than hierarchy. Instead of promotions being the primary way to acknowledge high performers, companies should design pathways where employees can expand their influence by leading initiatives, shaping critical decisions, and contributing to strategic problem-solving, regardless of their title. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaders should invite those with relevant expertise into key discussions, regardless of rank. This also requires rewarding horizontal collaboration, where employees who bridge silos and drive cross-functional innovation are recognized and valued.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one organization transformation, Ron helped a global financial services company redesign how key leadership meetings were handled. Originally, the company invited attendees to the meeting based on their rank. In the new approach, each attendee was assigned a role with clear expectations. Afterwards, everyone in the room was expected to cascade key messages and decisions.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This eliminated the entitlement that senior leaders often display when it\u2019s \u201ctheir turn\u201d to join \u201cthe important meetings.\u201d&nbsp; Instead of, \u201cI deserve to be here because I\u2019m a senior vice president,\u201d leaders showed up with a broader understanding of how they could create success together. By centering contribution over hierarchy, organizations will create a culture where the most capable and impactful employees thrive, decision-making is faster, and leadership pipelines are built on merit rather than tenure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the world of work continues to shift, leaders will do well to guide their organizations toward more adaptive structures that allow leadership to happen at all levels, and enable faster and more creative responses to market opportunities. It\u2019s time to leave behind outmoded approaches to leading and organizing human endeavors.</p>",

    "description": "<p>We are living with a lot of uncertainty right now. There are some economic <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91364101/trump-tariffs-japan-south-korea\">headwinds</a>, though <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/hiring\" title=\"Hiring\">hiring</a> has remained robust. There are significant <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91363040/rural-hospitals-brace-for-crisis-as-gop-bill-slashes-medicaid-funding\">legislative changes</a> on the horizon. Ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East are creating global tensions. The rise of generative <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> has led to concerns about the future of many jobs and industries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difficulty of predicting the future complicates decision-making for people at every level of an organization from low-level employees who may be angling for a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91324244/are-you-really-ready-to-be-a-manager-becoming-a-manager\">promotion</a> or thinking of a career change to high-level leaders who have to set strategy and select tactics for an entire organization. How can you make good decisions in this environment?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-process-not-outcome\"><strong>Process not outcome</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to remember when making decisions in any environment (but particularly when there is a lot of turbulence) is that you have to focus on the process you use to choose rather than whether the outcome is the one you wanted. Begin by thinking about what information is important for the decision. Determine whether there are experts or team members you should consult along the way. Develop a method for combining information in advance if you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For complex decisions, this process probably requires some tools to help you keep track of the relevant information. Use spreadsheets and dashboards to organize data. Make lists of decision criteria and the weight that information should have in the ultimate choice so that you don\u2019t lose track of important factors. Refer to these tools along the way and don\u2019t rely only on your memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-know-your-risk-tolerance\"><strong>Know your risk tolerance</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two people faced with the same information and opportunities may not reach the same decision. A big factor you need to consider is your personal or organizational risk tolerance. What makes a decision difficult in uncertain environments is that future outcomes are not known. Even if you have access to all of the relevant information for the choice, there are factors outside of your control that will affect what happens, and you cannot know them in advance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you lay out your options, they will differ in your estimate of the likelihood of a bad outcome as well as the magnitude of that outcome. Ask yourself how willing and able you are to accept the worst-case scenario. When possible, avoid options where that worst-case is unacceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, consider the likelihood of that bad outcome. Are you willing to live with the size of that risk? When you are risk averse, you are likely to have a bad emotional experience with decisions that carry a substantial chance of a big downside. Ultimately, you have to live through that decision period. Selecting options that will make you miserable is not a recipe for success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-use-data-rather-than-anecdota\"><strong>Use data rather than anecdota</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Data relating to decisions is valuable, because it often provides you with a large number of cases to inform the decision. You may be focused on the number of people getting jobs, or the success of other firms that have pursued a particular strategy. You may also be using data to forecast the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the value of data, stories you hear are often compelling. Those studies can stick in the mind both because the outcomes from those stories feel salient, and because those stories come along with speculation about <em>why</em> a particular outcome occurred. That explanation can often make the future feel more certain than it really is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As enticing as these anecdotes are, resist the temptation to allow them to have an outsize influence on your decision. If the data are pointing you in one direction, be careful of a single story that is urging you to go in a different direction. When you have reliable data, make sure that it provides a more significant guide to your future actions than a good story.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-don-t-ignore-your-gut\"><strong>Don\u2019t ignore your gut</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, if your decision process is pushing you in a particular direction, but the decision still feels wrong, take a pause. <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/advancing-the-rationality-debate/C616BA01F179ECBE5884EDCCF0862238\">Psychologists</a> distinguish between fast intuitive processes that are sensitive to the statistics of the environment and slow algorithmic processes that work carefully through information. Data-driven decision processes use this slower process, while your intuition is driven by those faster processes affected by the impression created by the instances you have seen in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many times when you make a choice based on data, your intuition is either consistent with that option or doesn\u2019t create a strong preference. Sometimes, though, your intuition is opposed to the option the data suggests. In those cases, use the conflict between the data and your gut to pause and think more carefully. Check to see whether there is something missing from the data or whether the process you have used to combine data to reach a decision has led you astray.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you may still choose an option that \u201cfeels\u201d wrong, use that uneasiness as a sign that there should be some additional scrutiny before selecting a course of action. In addition, if the decision is one that can be amended or fixed even after you start on a particular path, use the tension between data and gut as a signal to remain vigilant for something you missed so that you detect problems as soon as they arise.</p>",

    "description": "<p>When the small French city of Albi needed a new bridge for cyclists and pedestrians, it didn\u2019t start from scratch. Instead, it asked architects to repurpose an old railway bridge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The viaduct, which spans nearly 600 feet across the Tarn River, is still in use by trains, so it wasn\u2019t possible to add a path on top. Instead, the new footbridge, which just opened, is attached to the side of the 19th-century structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It creates a direct link to walk or bike from the car-free city center to a large park and growing development on the other side of the Tarn. In the past, the only options for crossing were narrow, car-filled bridges farther down the river.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91366162\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/01-91364900-albi-bike-bridge.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: \u00a9<a href=\"https://vincentboutin.com/\">Vincent Boutin</a>/<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vincentboutin.photographe/\">@vincentboutin.photographe</a>]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the old bridges, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of traffic, and not much space for the pedestrians and bicycles,\u201d says Matthieu Malli\u00e9 of <a href=\"https://ney.partners/\">Ney Partners</a>, the Brussels-based firm that designed the new bridge. \u201cThe bicycles are in the vehicle lanes, so it\u2019s uncomfortable for them to take this road.\u201d With the new passageway, \u201cyou\u2019re in a dedicated area, and there are no cars,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no pressure from motorized traffic.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91366163\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/02-91364900-albi-bike-bridge.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: \u00a9<a href=\"https://vincentboutin.com/\">Vincent Boutin</a>/<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vincentboutin.photographe/\">@vincentboutin.photographe</a>]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bridge is one part of the local government\u2019s broader climate plan, which includes goals to cut car traffic and boost cycling. And it illustrates how going beyond a simple utilitarian design can increase the likelihood that people will actually prefer to walk or bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91366165\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/05-91364900-albi-bike-bridge.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: \u00a9<a href=\"https://vincentboutin.com/\">Vincent Boutin</a>/<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vincentboutin.photographe/\">@vincentboutin.photographe</a>]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the new bridge, it\u2019s possible to see the historic viaduct up close, something that wasn\u2019t accessible before. And the path includes extra space under each arch of the viaduct for people to linger and look at the city. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re looking at the frame of a painting,\u201d Malli\u00e9 says. \u201cThe existing viaduct frames the landscape. It helps you understand the city from an unusual point of view.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding on to the old bridge also made it cheaper to build, at a cost of around 5.5 million euros (roughly $6.4 million). &#8220;From a structural and economical point of view,\u201d Malli\u00e9 says, \u201cit makes sense to reuse an existing structure.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<hr />",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91365929/3-ways-cities-reclaim-streets",
    "description": "<p>I\u2019m a drummer with a soft spot for vintage snares. I own a few that rarely get played. They sound great and look even better, but they take up space. If I kept collecting more, I\u2019d eventually have to give up something else: chairs, food, clothes, books, art. No matter how practical I claim these drums are, they\u2019re bulky objects that sit idle for most of their life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to city building, Americans struggle to apply that same basic interior design logic to personal vehicles. The magical thinking is that 10 pounds of Motordom can fit in a 5-pound bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Country living, suburban living, and city living are not interchangeable. You should be free to choose whatever suits you best, including the kind of vehicle you want to drive. But cities have a constraint that rural areas and the suburbs don\u2019t\u2014physical space. There simply isn\u2019t enough room for every household to store multiple personal vehicles out front, let alone build the number of lanes so that everyone can drive in the same direction at the same time.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/latest/rss?truncated=true\">\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-automobile-storage-centers\">Automobile storage centers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite that physical reality, most American cities have been engineered as massive automobile storage centers. This isn\u2019t a value judgment about driving. It\u2019s a spatial critique. Cars are large objects that sit idle 95% of the time\u2014and when cities prioritize motor vehicles over everything else, it\u2019s inevitable that housing, parks, and commerce get squeezed out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every time a road is widened, space for people walking, rolling, and riding bikes shrinks. Intersections balloon, making crossings longer and more dangerous. Parking garages devour valuable land. Building cities around the automobile is an absurd and wasteful decision that leaves cities congested, expensive, and less livable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The worst part is that it doesn\u2019t even work. Expanding roads to \u201csolve traffic\u201d only invites more people to make trips they wouldn\u2019t have made. (The wonky planning term is \u201cinduced demand.\u201d) When you make solo driving easier, more people drive solo. The new lanes fill up, and the traffic jams return.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-places-of-exchange\">Places of exchange</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cities are places of exchange: goods, services, ideas, and relationships. That exchange requires space\u2014not just for people to live, but to move, meet, flirt, play, rest, buy stuff, sell stuff, or just plain linger. Building cities around people\u2014instead of machines\u2014delivers places people want to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like any interior designer knows, good design isn\u2019t about cramming more furniture in an already-packed room. It\u2019s about prioritizing what makes the space work for the people using it. Here are three proven strategies for applying that same mindset to your city\u2019s public realm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-stop-forcing-developers-to-build-car-storage\">1. Stop forcing developers to build car storage.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Minimum parking mandates are among the most damaging policies in city planning. These rules require developers to build a set number of parking spaces regardless of context or market conditions. A local government might require 150 parking spaces for a 100-unit apartment building near high-frequency transit. The rulemakers don\u2019t care if it\u2019s easy to opt out of owning a car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These mandates inflate construction costs, reduce housing supply, and crowd out other uses. Let the property owners decide how much parking makes sense. American cities already have abundant housing for cars.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-expand-your-view-of-pedestrians\">2. Expand your view of pedestrians.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Frequent and reliable bus service is an \u201cexpress sidewalk.\u201d Think of bus routes as part of the walking network\u2014an option you use when the weather\u2019s bad, your bag\u2019s heavy, or your legs are tired. That mindset shift helps normalize transit as a default mode of movement, not a last resort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engineering solutions like dedicated lanes and signal priority help keep the buses from being stuck in traffic. The more the bus feels like a moving sidewalk, the more people will choose it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-make-bike-rides-pleasant\">3. Make bike rides pleasant.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A connected bike network is one of the most cost-effective ways to increase mobility and reduce congestion. Especially now, with the rise of e-bikes, a 5-mile ride becomes a breeze even for older adults. E-bikes flatten hills, reduce sweat, and make iffy weather more manageable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build protected bike lanes that link destinations (residential areas, job centers, retail corridors, etc.). Build secure parking and charging stations for electric cargo bikes. Make biking the most attractive option for short trips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cities shouldn\u2019t be treated like storage units for large piles of personal property. If you wouldn\u2019t let stacks of idle drum kits block your kitchen, don\u2019t let oversize metal boxes dominate your streets. Good urban design, like good interior design, serves the people who live there.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/latest/rss?truncated=true\">",

    "description": "<p>At its heart, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91352935/pentagon-pizza-index-the-theory-that-surging-pizza-orders-signal-global-crises\">pizza</a> is deceptively simple. Made from just a few humble ingredients\u2014baked dough, tangy sauce, melted cheese, and maybe a few toppings\u2014it might seem like a perfect candidate for the kind of mass-produced standardization that defines many global food chains, where predictable menus reign supreme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, visit two pizzerias in different towns, or even on different blocks of the same town, and you\u2019ll find that pizza stubbornly refuses to be homogenized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bPBJ8bkAAAAJ&amp;hl/\">We are researchers</a> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/avi-ackerman-78839190/\">working on</a> a local <a href=\"https://www.gainesvilleflbusinesshistory.com\">business history project</a> that documents the commercial landscape of Gainesville, Florida, in the 20th and 21st centuries. As part of that project, we\u2019ve spent a great many hours over the past two years <a href=\"https://gbhoralhistories.com\">interviewing local restaurant owners</a>, especially those behind Gainesville\u2019s independent pizzerias. What we\u2019ve found reaffirms a powerful truth: Pizza resists sameness\u2014and small pizzerias are a big reason why.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-standardized-pizza-rose-but-didn-t-conquer\">Why standardized pizza rose but didn\u2019t conquer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While tomatoes were unknown in Italy <a href=\"https://peerj.com/articles/12790/\">until the mid-16th century</a>, they have since become synonymous with Italian cuisine\u2014especially through pizza.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pizza arrived in the U.S. from Naples <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/P/bo6166003.html\">in the early 20th century</a>, when Italian immigration was at its peak. Two of the biggest destinations for Italian immigrants were New York City and Chicago, and today each has a distinctive pizza style. A <a href=\"https://pizzatoday.com/topics/dough-production-development/new-york-style-pizza-new-york-state-of-mind/\">New York slice</a> can easily be identified by its thin, soft, foldable crust, while <a href=\"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/jeff-mauro/true-chicago-style-deep-dish-pizza-5612273\">Chicago pies</a> are known for deep, thick, buttery crusts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After World War II, other regions developed their own types of pizza, including the famed <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/27/the-lasting-pleasures-of-new-haven-pizza\">New Haven</a> and <a href=\"https://pizzaeveryfriday.substack.com/p/detroit-style-pizza-how-to\">Detroit styles</a>. The New Haven style is known for being thin, crispy, and charred in a coal-fired oven, while the Detroit style has a rectangular, deep-dish shape and thick, buttery crust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the latter half of the 20th century, pizza had become a staple of the American diet. And as its popularity grew, so did demand for consistent, affordable pizza joints. Chains such as Pizza Hut, founded in 1958, and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91336962/papa-johns-turned-its-food-into-a-rebrand-and-its-rebrand-back-into-food\">Papa John\u2019s</a>, established in 1984, applied <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/McDonald_s.html?id=ujjPqahQ2F0C\">the model pioneered by McDonald\u2019s</a> in the late 1940s, adopting limited menus, assembly line kitchens, and franchise models built for consistency and scale. New technologies such as point-of-sale systems and inventory management software made things even more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As food historian Carol Helstosky explains in <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/P/bo6166003.html\"><em>Pizza: A Global History</em></a>, the transformation involved simplifying recipes, ensuring consistent quality, and developing formats optimized for rapid expansion and franchising. What began as a handcrafted, regional dish became a highly replicable product suited to global mass markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.yum.com/wps/portal/yumbrands/Yumbrands/company/our-brands/pizza-hut\">more than 20,000 Pizza Huts</a> operate worldwide. Papa John\u2019s, which runs <a href=\"https://www.papajohns.com/franchise/\">about 6,000 pizzerias</a>, built its brand explicitly on a promise rooted in standardization. In this model, success means making pizza the same way, everywhere, every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what happened to the independent pizzerias? Did they get swallowed up by efficiency?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not quite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chain restaurants don\u2019t necessarily suffocate small competitors, <a href=\"https://www.igi-global.com/gateway/chapter/369908\">recent research shows</a>. In fact, in the case of pizza, they often coexist, sometimes even fueling creativity and opportunity. Independent pizzerias\u2014there are <a href=\"https://www.pmq.com/pizza-power-report-2023/\">more than 44,000</a> nationwide\u2014lean into what makes them unique, carving out a niche. Rather than focusing only on speed or price, they compete by offering character, inventive toppings, personal service, and a sense of place that chains just can\u2019t replicate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-local-pizza-scene-creativity-in-a-corporate-age\">A local pizza scene: Creativity in a corporate age</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For an example, look no farther than Gainesville. A college town with fewer than 150,000 residents, Gainesville doesn\u2019t have the same culinary cachet as New York or Chicago, but it has developed a unique pizza scene. With 13 independent pizzerias serving Neapolitan, Detroit, New York, Mediterranean styles, and more, hungry Gators have a plethora of options when craving a slice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes Gainesville\u2019s pizza scene especially interesting is the range of backgrounds its proprietors have. Through interviews with pizzeria owners, we found that some had started as artists and musicians, while others had worked in engineering or education\u2014and each had their own unique approach to making pizzas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The owner of Strega Nona\u2019s Oven, for example, uses his engineering background to turn dough-making into a science, altering the proportions of ingredients by as little as half of a percent based on the season or even the weather.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91366275\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-1-91364843-conversation-pizza.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Visitors to Satchel\u2019s Pizza get a creative welcome. [Photo: courtesy of the authors]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gbhoralhistories.com/interview-page/6\">Satchel\u2019s Pizza</a>, on the other hand, is filled with works <a href=\"https://www.gainesville.com/story/news/2012/08/13/satchel-raye-spirit-of-gainesville-nominee/31629855007/\">made by its artist owner</a>, including mosaic windows, paintings, sculptures, and fountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gainesville\u2019s independent pizzerias often serve as what sociologists call \u201c<a href=\"https://esl.uchicago.edu/2023/11/01/third-places-what-are-they-and-why-are-they-important-to-american-culture/\">third places</a>\u201d\u2014spaces for gathering that aren\u2019t home or work. And their owners think carefully about how to create a welcoming environment. For example, the owner of <a href=\"https://gbhoralhistories.com/interview-page/10\">Scuola Pizza</a> insisted the restaurant be free of TVs, so diners can focus on their food. <a href=\"https://gbhoralhistories.com/interview-page/4\">Squarehouse Pizza</a> features a large outdoor space: an old, now repurposed school bus outfitted with tables and chairs to dine in, and a stage for live music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Squarehouse also is known for its unusual toppings on square, Detroit-style pies\u2014for example, the Mariah Curry, topped with curry chicken or cauliflower, and coconut curry sauce. It refreshes its specialty menus every semester or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the American pizza landscape may be shaped by big brands and standardized menus, small pizzerias continue to shine. Gainesville is a perfect example of how a local pizza scene in a small Southern college town can be unique, even in a globalized industry.

    "description": "<p>Shopping has evolved more over the past 10 years than it has in the previous 50.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once rooted in an in-person experience of trial and tactility, the path to purchase has changed dramatically\u2014propelled by rapid advancements in technology, shifting consumer expectations, and most significantly, global events and disruptions that reshaped the way we connect and consume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic served as an inflection point that <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever\">accelerated digital adoption</a> at lightning speed. Now, new geopolitical challenges like rising tariffs are adding further complexity and pressing brands to reimagine how they engage with their consumers, deliver value, and maintain loyalty in a rapidly evolving retail landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the last 10 years have taught retailers anything, it\u2019s that adaptability is everything. The brands that thrive are those that embrace innovation, not as a trend to follow, but as a mindset during uncertain times. As we look to the future, continued technological advances ease the way when policy and pricing pressures are squeezing margins. Technology will also shepherd in a new era of hyper-personalized, predictive experience for beauty consumers that blends digital and physical experiences seamlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-beauty-retail-s-biggest-turning-points\"><strong>Beauty retail\u2019s biggest turning points</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A decade ago, the retail landscape was just beginning to feel the true impact of digital disruption. E-commerce was <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/retail/releases/historical/ecomm/15q4.pdf\">growing</a> but still held a minority share compared to brick-and-mortar sales. With mobile commerce <a href=\"https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/Q3-2015-ECommerce-Jumps-15-YY-to-697-Billion-in-Sales#:~:text=In%20Q3%202015%2C%20Comscore%20estimates,%C2%AE%20or%20contact%20us%20today.\">on the rise</a>, retailers needed to optimize for smaller screens and on-the-go buyers. Buy online, pick up in store was still a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2015/12/20/buy-online-pick-up-in-store-simple-right-not-this-christmas/\">relative novelty</a>. Social media was <a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/whats-changing-social-media-marketing-2015\">gradually evolving</a> from a place to chat with friends into a destination for product discovery, but it was not yet a primary sales channel. Personalization was nascent, but it was limited primarily to email campaigns and site recommendations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These trends would continue to evolve over the next handful of years, with incremental progress and increased adoption each year. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the gas pedal on these transformations. Overnight, the shopping experience completely changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly, online shopping became the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/04/ecommerce-sales-surged-during-pandemic.html\">default preference</a> for consumers, and shoppers could easily choose between same-day delivery, curbside pick-up, shipping, and more. This was the moment retailers doubled down on their technology investments in <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a>, automation, and better customer data infrastructure, which has surged in the years since. Social commerce via <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/tiktok\" title=\"TikTok\">TikTok</a>, Instagram, and YouTube blossomed with live shopping and creator recommendations that encouraged consumers to discover and add their favorite finds to cart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even tactile beauty products that typically require customers to sample and try on before buying became sought-after online products, launching beauty brands into the next era of technology adoption. Virtual try-on using augmented reality and AI-driven product matching and recommendations became industry must-haves. Consumers began to expect unified and tailored shopping journeys across every touchpoint\u2014from virtually trying on lipstick via a mobile app to receiving AI-powered skincare recommendations on a laptop. An increasingly saturated marketplace and influences from a complex web of content, reviews, and recommendations turned personalization into table stakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-beauty-retail-s-consumer-centric-reset\"><strong>Beauty retail\u2019s consumer-centric reset</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, retail has evolved from a largely transactional, siloed model into a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The biggest shift? Power has moved into the hands of the consumer, who now expects personalization, participation, and seamlessness wherever and however they choose to shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last decade has proven that beauty shoppers are primed and ready for the industry\u2019s next transformation, which is coming at a moment of heightened economic uncertainty. Consumer behavior is echoing the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, with shoppers now tightening their <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/04/19/consumer-spending-trump-tariffs-covid-study/83117941007/\">purse strings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-04-16/shoppers-are-panic-buying-because-of-tariffs-it-won-t-last\">panic-buying</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/economics/longer-hair-nails-home-fewer-facials-economic-warning-signs-are-flashi-rcna201807\">ditching the salon</a>. During the pandemic when life became contactless, the industry had to pivot fast and reimagine how customers discover, try, and buy products. Now tariffs, global supply chain fragility, and regional policy shifts are sparking another wave of reinvention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s retailers must meet this moment by balancing the demand for integrated, customer-centric shopping flows with the operational need for agility, efficiency, and resilience. The challenge\u2014and opportunity\u2014lies in building an ecosystem that can flex with the market, while still delivering the elevated, intuitive experiences modern beauty shoppers expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-next-for-beauty-retail-agentic-ai\"><strong>What\u2019s next for beauty retail? Agentic AI</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology proved essential in maintaining connection and engagement during the COVID-19 lockdowns, and it continues to serve as a critical bridge between brands and consumers amid today\u2019s financial and geopolitical pressures. But the next chapter will be shaped by something far more transformative: the emergence of agentic AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a></a>Unlike traditional AI systems that respond to user inputs with passive recommendations, agentic AI operates autonomously\u2014learning, reasoning, and initiating actions on behalf of the consumer. This means moving beyond surface-level personalization to deliver true, proactive value, marking a fundamental disruption to the traditional shopping journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a></a>In a world where tariffs, supply chain constraints, and fluctuating prices create uncertainty, agentic AI brings stability and foresight. It enables brands to meet each shopper not just where they are\u2014but where they\u2019re going\u2014 and unlocks unprecedented operational flexibility. Sampling, trial, education, and even replenishment can be driven digitally\u2014reducing overhead and mitigating exposure to global market volatility. For consumers, the shopping experience becomes less about browsing and more about being intuitively served, with smart systems anticipating needs, providing confidence, and removing friction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not just the next trend\u2014it\u2019s a paradigm shift. The brands that embrace agentic AI now will be best positioned to lead a new era of intelligent retail, where deep personalization, economic efficiency, and brand trust converge. Just as the past decade redefined where and how we shop, the next will redefine what helps us shop. And that helper, increasingly, will be agentic AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The industry\u2019s mission has always been to bridge the gap between innovation and consumer connection, helping brands reimagine what\u2019s possible even amidst global challenges. Technology is poised to continue its role as a vital lifeline that provides the stability and flexibility consumers and brands grab hold of as new trials emerge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Alice Chang is CEO and Founder of Perfect Corp.</em></p>",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91366460/for-creatives-perspective-is-tomorrows-most-valuable-skill",
    "description": "<p>Believe it or not, this is the best time in history to be a creative. Technology advances and platforms like Instagram and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/tiktok\" title=\"TikTok\">TikTok</a> have dramatically lowered the barriers to create work and share it with the world. There\u2019s less emphasis on formal degrees or certifications, and more value placed on having a portfolio that reflects your taste, sensibility, and point of view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, it\u2019s become more challenging to land (and keep) an entry-level role at an agency or design studio. <a href=\"https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/salary-hiring-trends/demand-for-skilled-talent/marketing-creative\">Studies</a> show that client pressure to produce more assets for less money has driven the push for greater efficiency in time and budget. As a result, teams have become leaner and more reliant on seasoned talent who can operate independently from day one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With many teams still working remotely or in the office only part time, the expectation is often to self-manage and deliver with minimal oversight\u2014something that\u2019s inherently more difficult for those just starting out. In my work with the creative organization and educational charity D&amp;AD, I\u2019ve seen firsthand that it\u2019s a complicated picture, full of real structural challenges. And it\u2019s evolving in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this moment is also full of opportunity, so long as creative talent and educators evolve accordingly and don\u2019t ignore the industry\u2019s changing creative needs. Today, nurturing creativity isn\u2019t about learning specific skills in design, VFX, production, writing, and more. Instead, it\u2019s about perspective\u2014each creative&#8217;s unique lens on the world informed by their lived experiences, personal network, and interactions. And it must be nurtured if we\u2019re to navigate the uncertainty the industry is facing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-critical-creative-shift\"><strong>A critical creative shift</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The accessibility of creative tools\u2014and their ease of use\u2014have opened the industry to fresh voices and perspectives. It\u2019s part of the reason we initially launched Shift, our free night school for self-taught creatives, to serve a growing influx of diverse creators coming from outside traditional pathways. Similarly, emerging tech is also fueling <a href=\"https://journal.everypixel.com/ai-image-statistics\">record-breaking</a> creative output. This past year alone, we\u2019re increasingly <a href=\"https://campaigns.dandad.org/ai-trend-report-2025\">becoming accustomed to</a> embracing and awarding work utilizing <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> to push creative boundaries. But while more people are creating at a higher frequency, far fewer are doing it with the focus, consistency, and discipline required to achieve real expertise or mastery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the concept is often contested, Malcolm Gladwell <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/complexity-and-the-ten-thousand-hour-rule\">popularized</a> the idea that it takes 10,000 hours to truly get great at something. It&#8217;s harder to reach that threshold in today\u2019s creative industry. The pace is fast, attention is fragmented, and opportunities to go deep into one discipline are increasingly rare. We\u2019re also missing the network and community that made it easier in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some might say that taste and storytelling are the creative skills that will help talent survive this industry-wide shift, the truth is that both are becoming table stakes. The real creative differentiator is the ability to leverage your unique perspective, developing an insight that addresses a challenge. Then, you have to be able to articulate your perspective well enough to orchestrate creativity around it\u2014to lead multidisciplinary inputs, shape ideas across human and machine collaborators, and still land on something culturally relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a world where the tools are accessible to everyone, the people who can apply their voices and direct creative impact\u2014not just generate more and faster creative outputs\u2014become indispensable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that everyone needs to be a content creator or a polymath. What\u2019s changing is the need for new and deeper cultural points of reference, the ability to articulate and communicate those references, and the expectation that creatives understand how different mediums and roles interact. Even if you\u2019re not doing it all yourself, you need to be able to collaborate across disciplines, speak multiple creative \u201clanguages,\u201d and move fluidly between ideas and execution.<em></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nbsp-value-your-experiences\"><strong>&nbsp;Value your experiences</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As talent looks to future-proof their careers, there\u2019s several steps they can take to make sure their unique voices and experiences become valuable assets in meeting tomorrow&#8217;s creative needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, they should hone their perspective, particularly if they\u2019re coming to the creative industry from non-traditional educational or cultural paths. Not only do they <em>not</em> need to conform; the industry urgently <em>needs</em> its nonconformist perspectives to evolve. Increasingly, when brands and orgs ask creatives to address a specific challenge, they don\u2019t want guesses from outsiders to that challenge. They want people who can speak to their own communities\u2014with similar interests, concerns, impulses, and experiences. In this sense, creatives can be the missing insight that the industry is lacking. So, they should do what they can to protect and value their identities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, talent should go beyond traditional skills as they expand their creative knowledge. The bulk of education can\u2019t be only focused on learning creative tools. In our Shift program attendees, we often see gaps in industry literacy: how roles work, how to respond to a brief, or how to turn creativity into a career. Creatives should seek out opportunities to build those more practical skills through classes or even mentorship. This kind of knowledge not only makes it easier to earn a job and helps shape good work, but fuels the confidence behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most companies say creative talent is key to their business, few invest in developing that talent in ways that speaks the language of ideas, ambiguity, or cultural tension. These are the creative building blocks of insight. And it\u2019s crucial that we cultivate this resource if we want to ensure a strong creative future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Kwame Taylor-Hayford is the cofounder of Kin and president of </em><a href=\"https://www.dandad.org/\"><em>D&amp;AD</em></a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>PEORIA, Ill. (TCN) --</strong>&nbsp;A 19-year-old man recently entered a plea agreement for killing his girlfriend and trying to stage her death as a suicide after she allegedly texted another man.</p>\n        <p><a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peoriacounty.gov%2FCivicAlerts.aspx%3FAID%3D1152&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmary.mehrkens%40truecrimenews.com%7C22bbe8768eb84ef8264308ddbff38484%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638877774796571789%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=LYjcw8NZqx50J7BzpKMkBrC5qgMutiqamQ5tTw%2BGt1M%3D&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\">The Peoria County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office</a>&nbsp;said Nathaniel Archuleta pleaded guilty on July 7 to first-degree murder in connection with the death of his girlfriend, Mary Halcomb. He received 45 years in the Illinois Department of Corrections and will have to serve 100% of his sentence.</p>\n        <p>According to prosecutors, on Sept. 6, 2024, police responded to a report of a woman who shot herself and found Halcomb \"lying in a pool of blood on the stairwell landing with a gun in her hand.\" She sustained one gunshot wound to the neck and was pronounced deceased.</p>\n        <p>Investigators uncovered evidence suggesting Halcomb didn\u2019t end her own life, including a blood trail that revealed her body was likely moved. In the downstairs bedroom, authorities also reportedly discovered a Post-it note that said, \"I, Mary Elyce Halcomb, promise to never break Nathaniel Archuleta\u2019s heart, and if I do, Nathaniel Archuleta has every right to euthanize me, vice versa, I love you.\"</p>\n        <p>Prosecutors said Archuleta provided inconsistent statements during the investigation. He reportedly first said his girlfriend\u2019s death was a suicide, and then he claimed he was cleaning his gun when it accidentally went off. According to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, Archuleta later confessed to an inmate \"that he shot Mary because he caught her texting another man.\"</p>\n        <p>During the defendant\u2019s plea hearing, prosecutors said the victim\u2019s family members and loved ones were present, and they \"tearfully described the emotional toll her death had caused them. They spoke of sleepless nights, nightmares, and persistent heartbreak.\"</p>\n        <p>According to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, loved ones described \"struggling with trust, fear, depression, and anxiety. They called Archuleta\u2019s actions selfish and unforgivable, stating that blood will forever be on his hands and that justice must now be served.\"</p>\n        <p><strong>MORE:</strong></p>\n        <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.peoriacounty.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1152\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Man Pleads Guilty to Murder of Girlfriend - Peoria County State's Attorney's Office</a></li></ul>",

U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/4202494/remarks-by-secretary-of-defense-pete-hegseth-at-the-2025-shangri-la-dialogue-in/\" target=\"_blank\">warned recently</a> that an invasion \"could be imminent\", saying at a summit in Singapore at the end of May, that \"There's no reason to sugarcoat it: the threat China poses is real.\" The Defense Secretary also said that Beijing is \"credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific,\" adding, \"to be clear: any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world.\" Hegseth is not alone in believing that a Chinese invasion is inevitable as part of President Xi Jinping\u2019s plan to \u201cre-unify\u201d the island with mainland China. But it is also just part of a much broader strategy that long-term, poses significantly higher stakes.</p><p>As a result of the threat posed to U.S. national security, the CIA established the China Mission Center in 2021, with the aim of better coordinating the collection and analysis components of intelligence to better inform U.S. policymakers \u2013 and most importantly, the Agency\u2019s number one customer \u2013 the president of the United States \u2013 with the most accurate information possible about Xi Jingping\u2019s intent and timeline. Cipher Brief Expert Susan Miller, who retired from the CIA just a few months ago - where she served as the Assistant Director at the Center - told <em>The Cipher Brief</em> that Xi\u2019s intent is not only to forcefully reunify Taiwan. In fact, that\u2019s just the beginning.</p><p><em>Cipher Brief CEO & Publisher Suzanne Kelly talked with Miller about how U.S. intelligence is working to better understand what Xi is thinking. Our Subscriber+ interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><div class=\"expert-block-container expert-list\">\n<div class=\"expert-item\">\n<div class=\"expert-image\">\n<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/susan-miller\">\n<img alt=\"Susan Miller, Former Assistant Director of China Mission Center, CIA\" src=\"https://assets.rbl.ms/60329984/origin.jpg\" />\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"expert-description\">\n<h4 class=\"expert-name\">\n<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/susan-miller\">Susan Miller, Former Assistant Director of China Mission Center, CIA</a>\n</h4>\n<p class=\"expert-about\">\n        Miller spent 39 years at CIA as an operations officer, serving nine tours abroad, two as a Case Officer, one as Deputy Chief of Station and six tours as Chief of Station. She also served as assistant director of several mission centers at the Agency. \n      </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong></em><em><strong>What do you think it is that the American people need to understand about why China is posing a threat to U.S. national security and how they\u2019re doing it?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>He wants to absolutely replace the U.S. as the world leader, but he doesn't want to replace us as the world leader of democracy. He wants to replace us as the world influencer. He knows that we're going to go to war someday because he absolutely plans in the coming decade, if not in the shorter term, to invade Taiwan. And he absolutely knows that we would come to the defense of democracies around the world. So, in order to give him the edge, he has - not only in America but all around the globe - been able to get into national power grids. Just think, what could you do with that capability in a time of war? You turn off the power. We know he's in power grids in America and Europe and Africa and Asia.</p><p>Why? Because companies from the People\u2019s Republic of China underbid other companies. Now that ability is gone. That's something that the previous administration and the current administration both said, \u2018<em>we're not going to let anybody get at our current infrastructure\u2019</em>. But can you imagine if we decide to go to war to support Taiwan or we have to do it because something else has happened, can you imagine having no power in California or along the Eastern seaboard? And that's why we need to really care. And Xi Jinping\u2019s plan is to take us over bit by bit. There are some things that we have kind of let go, although we shouldn't have. One of them is that he has taken over U.S. influence in Africa and other developing countries.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> </strong><strong>China has certainly used its Belt and Road Initiative to moving into these areas and they're bringing money and they're bringing infrastructure and they're making day-to-day life better for the locals \u2013 at least in the short-term.</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Yes. They're doing what we used to do with USAID and with getting U.S. companies to kind of sign up and go do this, so that we could make sure we still get important minerals and so that we can make the widgets that we need to make from all of these countries. And then we also provide a platform where a democracy can at least start and maybe not ever be as robust as ours, but at least be better than what they have now. So, that's a real concern. China is stepping into a lot of these roles all over the world. And that bothers me because that should be us doing that.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> You\u2019ve also spent a lot of your professional career focused on the threat posed by Russia. Today, when you're comparing the China threat to the Russia threat, how are these threats different?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Can you name one thing you have ever bought that says Made in China? We all can, right? Have you ever even thought about buying a toaster oven made in Russia? The answer is no. And so I'm oversimplifying this a little bit because the bottom line is that with China, we have an integrated economic goal that might help them not want to go to war with us in a way that with Russia, we have nothing.</p><p>I lived in Moscow back in the Soviet days, and my American toaster broke so I went down to a department store and bought a Russian made toaster. I plugged it in and it caught fire the first time. And it is still like that. That's why they don't manufacture stuff. There are other things that they have there. They do have some minerals and some other things. They have a pretty good agriculture system that works not only for their own people, but for that area as well. But the bottom line is that Putin does not have the same kind of leverage over us as Xi Jinping has.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> He has nuclear deterrence, but he doesn't have economic deterrence. Everyone is watching to see what happens in the negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, the war that Russia clearly did start, clearly unprovoked. And as everyone follows the slow-moving headlines on this, I'm wondering if you think Vladimir Putin, who was a former spy himself, sees the world differently than a former businessman, which Donald Trump certainly has skills in the business world. But where do you see these two things potentially colliding in terms of how the U.S. needs to be approaching negotiating with someone like Putin?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Putin is not only a former intelligence guy from Russia. He also served as second chief directorate. And just to explain, first chief directorate spies, like CIA does, like MI6 does. You go overseas, you spot, assess, develop operations and things like that. The second chief directorate, they were the ones that put anybody who dared to say that the Soviet Union wasn't the best thing in the world into gulags. They also tortured people, dissidents, et cetera. And so he came from the nasty side of the KGB. And he's always been a believer in Russia having lost something under Yeltsin. And a guy like him - and there are a lot of them like him, just think of our version of white supremacists or white Nazi or American Nazis, things like that - that's their version. These are the people that support and work in the second chief directorate. So, that's the concern.</p><p>He doesn't care about human life. He doesn't care if his own people die in a war with Ukraine. He knows they're dying. And he knows that they're not making much progress and he's mad at his generals, but I can guarantee, in typical Russian \u2013 and I don't have absolute evidence of this because I don't have any exquisite intelligence on this - but he's probably underfunding them. They're probably not dressed well. There is still conscription going on there. And they're not that happy either. Whereas in Ukraine, they are fighting for their lives. And that, to me, is what is astounding Putin.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> The Cipher Brief has been briefed on reports from Ukrainians that captured Russian soldiers have relayed some of what they have been dealing with as are deployed to the front. A lot of them are reportedly untrained and in some cases, they reportedly didn't know who their commander was. So we know there's chaos within the ranks for sure. But we've seen something since the invasion of Ukraine that we hadn't seen on the world stage quite like this before, and that is this new friendship without any limits between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Does that concern you in a different way than these threats do on an individual basis?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>It does concern me, yes. It is concerning and it is different now that they claim they have this friendship without limits. But does any dictator really have a friend? Somebody they totally trust that they'll tell everything and vice versa? And if Xi Jinping says, \u2018<em>yes, of course I'll give you some some terrific bombs</em>,\u2019 and things like that, Xi also has to think about what kind of economic downturn is going to happen inside China if every country that sides with Ukraine - which is a lot of democracies around the world - says, \u2018<em>you know, we're going to start boycotting China\u2019</em>. That's one of the things he has to be extremely careful about.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> You stood up the China mission center for the CIA, which is something that didn\u2019t exist in this form prior. What do you think that should tell the American people about the importance of China and the importance of getting good intelligence on China?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>I was on my second tour in Israel when then-director [William] Burns came for a visit and during the long windy roads from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv, he mentioned that he had been talking with a China specialist at the agency and some others and said, \u2018<em>You know, I'm thinking we're not paying enough attention to China as the real strategic threat and even maybe a tactical one</em>\u2019, if you look at tactical being 10 years or less. And he said, \u2018<em>What do you think about that</em>?\u2019 I had been chief of East Asia division and chief in counter intelligence, and we had put Chinese spies behind bars. And I told him that we've been saying inside the agency for years, we are not paying enough attention to China. We were still dealing with remnants from 9/11 and Iraq and things like that, so I said, \u2018<em>I'm in\u2019</em>.</p><p>It took a while for us to figure it out and what we decided is that the China Mission Center owns property, that's going to be its own department. And so that's the China department basically, and Taiwan department at the agency. So that was one. Number two was we needed to look at the worldwide program. That's where we did the basically the external ops. And the goal was not only to work with stations - everything that we always do when we send out requirements - but we also needed to think about how we were going to do it a little bit differently so we had more success.</p><p>And so we started what we call STED, which is the Strategic Training and Education Department, which is kind of like TED talks, and they actually do a STED talk. And they're the ones that went out to every single mission center chief and built modules that really helped. So, that was the other thing that we did that was very different.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> A fascinating breakdown of how the intelligence community is prioritizing China as an intelligence target.</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em><em> </em></strong><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</strong></em></p>",

A jury previously convicted Blount in April of two counts of first-degree assault, two counts of first-degree robbery, and criminal possession of a weapon. He was acquitted of attempted murder charges.</p>\n        <p>According to prosecutors, on the night of Feb. 24, 2022, Blount approached Nina Rothschild as she was walking down the stairs to the Queens Plaza Subway station. The defendant reportedly had a black cane with him at the time and \"kicked Rothschild down the stairs, struck her on the head 13 times with a hammer, and grabbed\" her tote before fleeing.</p>\n        <p>Rothschild sustained multiple skull fractures and was transported to a hospital, where she required emergency surgery to remove parts of her skull and replace them with titanium mesh. Authorities noted that Rothschild also suffered a broken finger and other injuries.</p>\n        <p>Investigators obtained surveillance footage that reportedly revealed Blount holding the victim's bag as he walked from the subway station toward a family member's residence in Long Island City.</p>\n        <p><a href=\"https://x.com/NYPDTips/status/1498062858856415232\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Officials arrested Blount</a> on Feb. 27, 2022. The following day, police executed a search warrant at a home and found a hammer, a black cane, and Rothschild's bag. According to the district attorney's office, further testing showed that both the victim's and the defendant's DNA were on the hammer.</p>\n        <p>In a statement, Queens County District Attorney Melinda Katz said, \"I thank the survivor for testifying during this trial and bravely facing her attacker in court.&nbsp;Our transit system must be safe for everyone, and this conviction sends a strong message that those who cause mayhem on our subways will be brought to justice.\"</p>\n        <p><strong>MORE:</strong></p>\n        <ul><li><a href=\"https://queensda.org/subway-attacker-sentenced-to-25-years-to-life-in-prison-for-robbery-and-assault-conviction-in-2022-hammer-attack-on-woman-in-queens-plaza-subway-station/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Subway Attacker Sentenced to 25 Years to Life in Prison for Robbery and Assault Conviction in 2022 Hammer Attack on Woman in Queens Plaza Subway Station - Queens County District Attorney's Office</a></li><li><a href=\"https://x.com/NYPDTips/status/1498062858856415232\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">News Release, 2/27/2022 - New York Police Department Crime Stoppers</a></li></ul>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>More countries aspire to be nuclear-weapons states, and we should prepare for this eventuality. That\u2019s why the Golden Dome missile defense initiative is timely and needed.</p><p>The war in Ukraine is a stark reminder that Ukraine giving up their nuclear weapons, pursuant to the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, in exchange for so-called security assurances, was a grave mistake. Indeed, If Ukraine retained any portion of its 1,900 nuclear warheads, would Russia have invaded Ukraine in 2014 and 2022 and risked a nuclear confrontation? Even a revanchist Vladimir Putin would have thought twice about the consequences of a nuclear war with Ukraine.</p><p>The 1968 Treaty on the non-proliferations of nuclear weapons (NPT) has been relatively effective in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology as the then-five nuclear-weapons states \u2013 the U.S. Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom \u2013 pursued nuclear disarmament. Over the years, however, Pakistan, India and North Korea have conducted nuclear tests and are now nuclear-weapons states, with Israel not acknowledging that they have nuclear weapons. North Korea was the only country to pull out of the NPT; the others never joined.</p><p>China refuses to enter any nuclear disarmament negotiations with the U.S. and Russia, while exponentially enhancing its nuclear-weapons arsenal. Since the failed Hanoi Summit in 2019, North Korea has raced to build more nuclear weapons and ballistic missile to deliver these weapons, to include a solid fuel Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) capable of targeting the whole of the U.S.</p><p>The U.S. and Israel just bombed Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow, given that Iran was enriching uranium at 60% purity, weeks away from the 90% purity for nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) May 31 report that stated Iran was in breach of its non-proliferation obligations and was denying monitors access to suspect nuclear sites reportedly contributed to the decision to bomb these sites.</p><p>Iran just announced that they were suspending cooperation with the IAEA until the safety of its nuclear facilities could be guaranteed.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It\u2019s never been more important to understand what\u2019s happening in the world. Upgrade your access to exclusive content by </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\"><em>becoming a subscriber</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p>Over 70% of South Koreans believe they need their own nuclear weapons, despite U.S. extended deterrent commitments. There\u2019s also a sense in Japan that eventually they also will need their own nuclear weapons, as a deterrent to North Korea and possibly China. The tension in the South and East China Seas and China\u2019s attempted intimidation of Taiwan are issues that will affect both Japan and South Korea. And indeed, an emboldened North Korea, now aligned with a revanchist Russian Federation, with a mutual defense treaty and North Korean troops in Russia participating in the war of aggression in Ukraine and receiving missile, satellite and nuclear support from Russia, may strike out at South Korea, in a conflict that could escalate quickly, to include the use of tactical nuclear weapons. Other countries in East Asia may feel compelled to also seek nuclear weapons, as a deterrent to any aggressor.</p><p>The same applies to the Middle East. Iran has been clear: They will continue to enrich uranium, despite the recent bombing of their nuclear facilities. But as a threshold nuclear weapons state, weeks away from fabricating nuclear weapons, calling for the annihilation of Israel, will there be a repeat of the U.S. and Israeli bombings? Will Iran now race to acquire nuclear weapons, especially now, given the removal of IAEA monitors?</p><p>Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey are very concerned about Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. Indeed, they may also feel a need to have their own nuclear weapons arsenal, for deterrent purposes. Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan publicly spoke about the unfairness of Turkey not having nuclear weapons as a deterrent given the precarious geopolitical situation in the region.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><em>Sign up today</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p>Our missile defense capabilities have lagged behind the advances in nuclear-weapons technology, especially the lethality of today\u2019s nuclear weapons that are eighty times more powerful than the atomic bombs used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p><p>There are currently over 13,000 nuclear weapons in the global stockpile of nuclear weapons, down from over 60,000 nuclear weapons during the Cold War. The New START arms control treaty between the U.S. and the Russian Federation, responsible for this reduction in nuclear weapons, expires on February 5, 2026, and Russia has refused to engage substantively on a successor to New START. So, what follows is uncertainty.</p><p>What is certain is that China will continue to build more nuclear weapons, with Beijing estimated to have over 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030; and North Korea, currently estimated to have over 50 nuclear warheads, is determined to build more nuclear weapons; and Iran is determined to remain a threshold nuclear-weapons state, weeks away from having nuclear weapons.</p><p>If South Korea and Japan and others in East Asia and if Saudi Arabia and Turkey and others in the Middle East decide to go nuclear, the global stockpile of nuclear weapons will increase exponentially. We also know that terrorist organizations, like Al-Qaeda, previously attempted to buy a nuclear weapon or radiological materials for a dirty bomb. And there may be countries willing to sell these weapons and radiological materials, or unable to securely store these weapons and materials that, then, are acquired by a rogue state or terrorist organization.</p><p>These are just some of the reasons why a Golden Dome <sub></sub>missile defense system is needed. Deploying space-based sensors and interceptors is no longer the Star Wars (Strategic Defense Initiative) that President Reagan pursued in 1983. We now have the technology and a budget of $175 billion to establish a viable missile defense capability hopefully within three years. We owe the American people security from the threat of a bad actor using nuclear weapons to attack the U.S.</p><p><em><strong>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/9/golden-dome-missile-defense-essential-americas-survival/\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Times</a></strong></em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business</strong></em><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>",

Emergency services personnel arrived and observed a laceration to the victim's neck and pronounced him deceased at the scene.</p>\n        <p>According to the complaint, when searching the area, officers discovered pools of blood on the driveway and throughout the house.</p>\n        <p>Authorities identified Armondo Paul, the ex-boyfriend of the victim's daughter, as the primary suspect. He fled the scene but was apprehended on June 28.</p>\n        <p>According to the complaint, Paul told investigators that on June 27, he brought a kitchen knife to his ex-girlfriend's house, \"which he intended to use to harm himself.\" Paul allegedly \"decided to shut off the power to elicit a response,\" and his ex-girlfriend then exited the residence. Her father reportedly tried to calm Paul down.</p>\n        <p>Paul allegedly said that his ex and her father went back into the house, and he \"felt rage\" before kicking the door and knocking back his ex-girlfriend and her dad.</p>\n        <p>According to the complaint, Paul told authorities he pulled and grabbed his ex's arm, and her father tried to pull him off. Paul then retrieved a knife and allegedly stabbed him in the neck. Paul reportedly said the victim fell and pulled the knife out of his neck before walking outside and collapsing in the driveway. </p>\n        <p>The suspect allegedly told investigators he went to his ex-girlfriend's room, and she was with her baby, who was startled, so he went back outside. The complaint alleges that Paul later went back into his ex-girlfriend's room again and \"announced he was going to kill himself because he was a monster, and he deserved it.\"</p>\n        <p>When the ambulance arrived, Paul reportedly fled to avoid arrest and discarded the weapon he allegedly used to stab the victim.</p>\n        <p>In an interview with Paul's ex, she purportedly claimed that Paul has \"always been abusive.\" He allegedly \"hit her, cornered her, took her phone, and broke things.\" When Paul's ex tried to break off the relationship, she alleges that he reacted \"violently\" and \"would not take no as an answer.\"</p>\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-nm/pr/shiprock-man-faces-federal-charges-fatal-stabbing-during-residential-break\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Mexico announced</a> July 3 that Paul faces a federal charge of second-degree murder and faces up to life in prison if convicted.

If my living room was filled with judgmental spirits, it felt disrespectful to remain such a mess</p><p>About a year after I moved into my apartment in Los Angeles, I was woken up by three loud knocks on my bedroom door at 3am. I thought there might be an intruder \u2013 but I got up, opened the door, and there was nobody there. I went to the front door, thinking I had misheard it, but there was nobody there either. I thought I had imagined it. Then it kept happening about once a week.</p><p>I thought it must be my upstairs neighbours, perhaps working a night shift, but after I introduced myself to them to ask about the noise, they assured me they wouldn\u2019t be awake at that hour. I asked the man who looks after our 70s-built apartment block if there were problems with the pipes. He said no. At one point, I started putting my dresser in front of the door, because I was so scared. I couldn\u2019t shake the idea that somebody was getting into my apartment, even though there was no evidence of it.

    "description": "<p><strong>FINE PRINT / OPINION \u2014 </strong>\u201cThis report explores the environmental effects and societal and economic consequences that would be expected to follow in the weeks-to-decades after a nuclear war. The exploration begins\u2026with the consideration of four plausible scenarios for the employment of nuclear weapons, along with description of the immediate effects of the energy release and blast from a nuclear detonation.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s an excerpt from Chapter 2 of a new congressionally-mandated study from the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) entitled, <em><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/independent-study-on-potential-environmental-effects-of-nuclear-war\" target=\"_blank\">Potential Environmental Effects of Nuclear War</a></em></em>, that was released online June 25.</p><p>Because I have written extensively about nuclear weapons, including in my 2021 book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/403ad3K\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Blown To Hell</em>,</a> which is about radioactive fallout on the Marshall Islanders from the Bikini thermonuclear Bravo test in 1954, I was surprised to read <span style=\"background-color: initial;\">that \u201cevaluation of radioactive fallout was not included in the scope of the work.\u201d That apparently was because so much had already been published about the impact of radiation and radioactivity from nuclear weapons.</span></p><p>This new NAS study focuses primarily on the release of thermal energy (heat) from a nuclear explosion in the lower atmosphere, as well as kinetic energy (blast) and the air shockwave caused by the latter. A nuclear detonation in the atmosphere, where the fireball does not hit the ground, releases some 35 percent of its energy in heat; another 50 percent in blast and shock wave, and the remaining 15 percent of energy in radiation.</p><p>Nonetheless, I believe the study is worth exploring, if only, for example, to see the \u201cfour plausible scenarios\u201d the expert writers see that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. In addition, studies such as these often disclose facts not normally available.</p><p>There were a series of scientific studies in the 1980s that raised concern about large-scale nuclear exchanges leading to \u201cnuclear winter\u201d scenarios. They showed that nearly every country in the world would be affected, beyond those in conflict. In those studies, nuclear use by superpowers caused immense firestorms whose light-blocking soot and particulates reduced sunlight to disrupt worldwide agriculture and ecosystems for years.</p><p>I believe reminders such as that make all such studies valuable, because they can reduce the likelihood of any nuclear weapon use. The authors of this new study apparently feel that way since they wrote, \u201cWith growing risks of nuclear proliferation and evolving warfare doctrines, this renewed scientific examination aims to quantify the grave global stakes should such hostilities occur in the current and future security environments.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Sign up for the </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Cyber Initiatives Group</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

They are the United Kingdom with an estimated 225 weapons; France with 290; India with 160; Pakistan with 170; China with 500 and growing; and North Korea with 50.</p><p>I must point out here that the NAS has omitted Israel, which has some 90 or more nuclear weapons, according to experts such as Hans Kristensen and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The U.S. Government and apparently the NAS follow Israeli policy of ambiguity, neither confirming nor denying their nuclear weapons exist, although they have had them since the late-1960s. Israel even has sub-launched, nuclear-tipped cruise missiles as well as nuclear bombs and land-based missiles.</p><p>In its study, the NAS presents what it describes as four plausible scenarios for nuclear weapon use:</p><p>Large-scale strategic usage of 2,000 warheads, where the scenario is that the Russia/U.S. nuclear exchanges begin at the tactical level, but escalate to the strategic level;</p><p>Moderate-scale strategic exchange of 400 warheads, where the scenario is a China/U.S. conflict;</p><p>Small-scale regional conflict of 150 warheads, such as one between Pakistan and India;</p><p>Very small-scale use of a single warhead, to \u201cdemonstrate resolve\u201d and \u201ca willingness to employ nuclear weapons.\u201d This scenario seems to follow the Russian strategy of \u201cescalate to de-escalate,\u201d that initially appeared in the past decade.</p><p>The NAS study says it has proposed these scenarios in order \u201cto study potential environmental inputs,\u201d though the study also \u201crecommends further development of a more comprehensive set of scenarios.\u201d</p><p>I should point out that I have been told that in U.S. military wargaming, when the scenario leads to one side using a nuclear weapon and escalation begins, the game usually ends because no one is prepared to say where nuclear exchanges are going or how to stop them.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

But the study notes that \u201cwhile some military targets are likely in or near urban areas, present-day [nuclear] weapons are generally more accurate and are of lower yields, which would likely reduce the impact on civilian structures.\u201d</p><p>Hiroshima, the Japanese target for the first U.S. atomic bomb, was described in a 1945 pre-attack U.S. government document put together by Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s Target Committee as \u201can important depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged.\u201d</p><p>The point was then, and I believe it remains now, that any decision to use a nuclear weapon is in recognition that its use would destroy property and kill many people, both military and civilian. Remember, some 70,000 people were killed at Hiroshima with thousands more dying later from effects of that one atomic bomb.</p><p>The NAS study points out, \u201cFollowing a nuclear blast [totaling one megaton], there are two surface-temperature pulses and two pulses of thermal radiation from the fireball.\u201d The first thermal pulse lasts just one-tenth of a second but is \u201ccapable of permanent or temporary effects on the eyes.\u201d</p><p>The second thermal pulse may last up to ten seconds and \u201ccarries about 99 percent of total thermal radiation energy\u2026 This radiation is the main cause of skin burns up to 12 miles or more away, and of eye effects at even greater distance. The radiation from the second pulse can also cause fires to start under suitable conditions.\u201d There was a firestorm at Hiroshima.</p><p>When it comes to the blast effect from nuclear weapons, the NAS study says, \u201cMost thermal radiation reaches material in advance of the blast wave,\u201d something that is not generally understood. The study adds, \u201cThe blast can extinguish flames, but can also leave smoldering material and rubble which can grow into larger fires. Blast waves can cause damage that results in secondary ignitions, thus being an additional source of fire starts.\u201d</p><p>Within the city limits of Hiroshima, 92 percent of all buildings were destroyed or damaged. Of that number, 63 percent were completely destroyed by fire, with only 5 percent completely destroyed only by blast.</p><p>The NAS study describes agriculture and food production as among the economic consequences of nuclear weapon usage, saying there \u201ccan be extensive direct and indirect impacts\u2026with far-reaching consequences for immediate and long-term food security.\u201d</p><p>In one of several radiation mentions, the NAS study says, \u201cRadioactive fallout, pollution, and habitat destruction could contribute to the decline of various plant and animal species, disrupting ecosystem services crucial for maintaining soil fertility, pest control and ecosystem health. This could further challenge agricultural systems to recover and adapt to the new post-war conditions.\u201d</p><p>I saw first-hand in the Marshall Islands in the 1970s that decades after being subjected to radioactive fallout from a powerful thermonuclear weapon ground-burst more than 100 miles away, plants grown on land and shellfish from the sea still showed radioactivity that made them dangerous to eat.</p><p>There is a footnote in the NAS study scenarios section that mentions so-called countervalue nuclear targets, which it describes as \u201ccivilian and cultural targets, population centers and infrastructure.\u201d In other words, they are urban or suburban civilian-populated areas.</p><p>That footnote adds: \u201cIn some sense, countervalue targets can be understood to be punitive or for revenge; however, these terms are currently considered out-dated and inappropriate with current U.S. nuclear strategy.\u201d</p><p>As I noted earlier, Oppenheimer and his Target Committee saw their massively powerful atomic bombs as devices to end a war, not fight one. In my terms, in 1945 they understood that their new nuclear bombs were terror weapons, designed to show how many buildings could be destroyed and people killed with a single bomb.</p><p>And I believe now, however one talks about nuclear weapons and no matter the number they have, they remain today terror weapons \u2014 and that is what deters their use today \u2013 at least against a nation that has its own nuclear weapons or is allied with such a nation.</p><p><em><strong><em>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

A growing sense of urgency is quietly emerging.</p><p>China\u2019s preparation for a potential invasion is no longer a distant possibility but a reality rapidly coming into focus \u2014and defense planners are grappling with a pressing question: how and when will Washington act?</p><p>\u201cTaiwan is incredibly reliant upon U.S. support for both deterrence against China, as well as a war-fighting invasion scenario,\u201d Kitsch Liao, associate director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global China Hub, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThe U.S. is the sole arms supplier for Taiwan because China has coerced every other country into not selling Taiwan any weapons.\u201d</p><p>Taiwan, a democratic and technologically vital island of 24 million people, faces increasing military, economic, and political pressure from Beijing.

In December, the People\u2019s Liberation Army launched its largest naval operation in the Taiwan Strait since 1996, simulating a blockade and attacks on foreign ships. Amphibious landing drills, maritime pressure campaigns, and cyber operations have intensified.</p><p>\u201cRelations are pretty bad, especially as China\u2019s economy struggles,\u201d Taiwanese legislator and Kuma Academy founder Puma Shen tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIf the economy falters, ideology becomes more important. Xi Jinping has chosen nationalism and the goal of \u2018Great China\u2019 as the main ideology, with taking back Taiwan as a key step.\u201d</p><p>In 2021, Admiral Phil Davidson, then Commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, <a href=\"https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/03/22/2003833850\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a> that China might seek to take Taiwan by 2027.

That makes the next decade a period to observe.\u201d</p><p>Even if a full-scale invasion is delayed, Taiwan still faces near-term risks, including cyberattacks, blockades, disinformation, and surprise strikes.</p><p>\u201cA war with Taiwan would not be localized. Missiles would likely hit Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines,\u201d Scott Huang, a researcher at Taiwan\u2019s National Science and Technology Council, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThese countries would get involved.

As Liao points out, \u201cChina observes no rules and offers no restrictions in conducting influence and espionage operations against the Taiwanese public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are talking about everything from ostensibly religious organization exchanges, charity support, to funneling illegal campaign contributions, and utilizing local Mafia for blackmail and potential assassinations,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe CCP United Front and espionage effort has been able to increase existing societal contradictions, such as Taiwan\u2019s ever-difficult identity issues, driving wedges into political issues, and convincing the Taiwanese population that they cannot possibly fight the Chinese.\u201d</p><p>Beijing has been <a href=\"https://techinformed.com/china-readies-for-cyber-attack-against-taiwan/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">using</a> cyberwarfare and information operations against Taiwan\u2019s population ahead of any potential military action. With Taiwan\u2019s strategic location and its centrality in the global supply chain\u2014especially in semiconductors\u2014China understands that victory does not need to come solely through kinetic means.</p><p><strong>Semiconductors and Strategic Leverage</strong></p><p>For Washington, the stakes are immense. Taiwan\u2019s TSMC <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-makes-the-majority-of-the-worlds-computer-chips-now-its-running-out-of-electricity/#:~:text=Along%20the%20way%2C%20Hsinchu%20Science,world's%20most%20advanced%20computer%20chips.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">manufactures</a> approximately 90 percent of the world\u2019s advanced semiconductors, powering AI, military systems, and the global economy. Washington has been trying to change that.</p><p>TSMC\u2019s decision, made <a href=\"https://www.tsmc.com/static/abouttsmcaz/index.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than</a> five years ago, to build fabrication plants in the United States\u2014most notably a $40 billion investment in Arizona\u2014has been hailed as a move to bolster supply chain security and reduce dependence on East Asia. The project includes two advanced chip facilities in Phoenix, one of which is expected to manufacture cutting-edge 3-nanometer chips by 2026.</p><p>But Chen\u2019s comments reflect a deeper strategic reality: the most advanced nodes of chip manufacturing, engineering talent, and supply chain infrastructure remain deeply entrenched in Taiwan. The Arizona expansion may provide redundancy, but some experts believe it cannot fully replace the island\u2019s dominant role in global chip production. For Beijing, that leverage adds to the strategic calculus. For Washington, it highlights why Taiwan\u2019s security is inextricably linked to America\u2019s economic and national security interests.</p><p>\u201cSemiconductors are Taiwan\u2019s major strategic asset. But whether the recent investment in Arizona was TSMC\u2019s idea or happened under U.S. pressure is unclear,\u201d Liang-Chih Evans Chen, an associate research fellow at Taiwan\u2019s Institute for National Defense and Security Research, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt could be seen as Taiwan trying to spread its risk by diversifying manufacturing. That\u2019s a reasonable strategy, but it\u2019s not realistic to completely move TSMC out of Taiwan.\u201d</p><p>Beyond economics, the Taiwan Strait is also a maritime artery.</p><p>\u201cAbout 80 percent of ships in Asia pass through the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Shen notes. \u201cTaiwan also produces key technology components, like chips, that power global industries. A conflict would impact housing prices and economies worldwide.\u201d</p><p><strong>America\u2019s Unfinished Playbook</strong></p><p>Despite lacking formal diplomatic ties or a defense treaty with Taiwan, the U.S. remains the island\u2019s primary arms supplier and strategic partner. While President Trump\u2019s current remarks favor ambiguity\u2014he\u2019s declined to specify if he\u2019d defend Taiwan. His administration approved major arms sales to Taiwan and oversaw the highest-level U.S. visit in decades. The mixed signals complicate planning, but signal continuity in support.</p><p>Five months ago, the State Department quietly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/china-taiwan-us-state-department\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">removed</a> language that distanced the U.S. from supporting an independent Taiwan. In March, the G7 issued a firm rebuke of China\u2019s coercive tactics toward Taiwan, omitting the \u201cOne China\u201d language for the first time.</p><p>Vice President J.D. Vance has called China the \u201cbiggest threat\u201d to Washington. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth recently <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0uauGCYMRw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a> that \u201cthe threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent.\u201d</p><p>Still, ambiguity persists at the highest levels.

Same with the Pentagon\u2019s Indo-Pacific Security Affairs post. That leaves a massive vacuum in communication,\u201d stressed Alexander Huang. \u201cThere\u2019s no alliance treaty, no joint exercises, no shared doctrine, no direct communication network.

Still, the waiting game has many on edge.</p><p>\u201cThe first indigenous submarine was supposed to undergo trials this October, but it\u2019s already behind schedule,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWith budget cuts, we don\u2019t know what will happen with submarines two and three.\u201d</p><p>Experts also warn that most civilians remain unprepared for large-scale conflict.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re prepared in the same way we turn on Netflix every night and say, \u2018Oh, poor people in Ukraine or Gaza\u2014but not us!\u2019\u201d Alexander Huang points out. \u201cWe think we\u2019re the chosen ones, living on a beautiful island.\u201d</p><p>Should China act, Taiwan will require resupply from the U.S.\u2014missiles, fuel, medical kits, and more. Escorting convoys, running blockades, and challenging Chinese air superiority will almost certainly demand U.S. military intervention. Analysts underscore that the time for preparation is narrowing.</p><p>\u201cDuring an invasion scenario, Taiwan will eventually require resupply for everything from missiles to critical medical supplies,\u201d Liao surmises. \u201cEscorting such supply convoys and running a Chinese blockade would require U.S. intervention.

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>President Donald J. Trump has returned to office with the renewed revelations that Chinese government-affiliated hackers continue to outmatch America\u2019s critical infrastructure cyber defenders through sabotage and espionage campaigns such as Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon.</p><p>The new Trump Administration must rebalance the cyber battlefield in America\u2019s favor by raising and incentivizing cybersecurity standards for the electric, oil and gas, nuclear power, water, telecommunications, financial services, public health, transportation, and other critical infrastructure sectors. </p><p>The mechanism would be the U.S. government, insurance providers, critical infrastructure operators, and technology providers collaboratively defining and maintaining data-based \u201cgood\u201d standards for each sector, building on the greatest strengths of the public and private domains for a \u201ccommon defense\u201d of the homeland, with cyberspace being recognized and prioritized as the first line of defense. </p><p>A new national security prioritization schema is essential because, unlike our traditional, kinetic focused military components, every moment of every day, America\u2019s public and private sector cyber warriors are battling nation-states in cyberspace. We must respond accordingly.</p><p><strong>Raising Standards through Transparency and Accountability</strong></p><p>The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) currently mandates high cyber defense standards for corporate members of the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). The new Trump team should extend this standard-setting practice, partnering with the insurance industry to establish high standards for America\u2019s private critical infrastructure operators.</p><p>The insurance industry would leverage its experience with cyber incident data from hundreds of thousands of cyber incidents to help government set these minimum standards across sectors and functions within sectors. </p><p>The government would require operators to establish Cybersecurity Information Centers (CICs) to audit organizational standards compliance, report their results to the government, and inform the management of their internal cyber security posture.</p><p>In much the same way that U.S. public companies are required to report financial results following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the CIC reporting standard would provide the government and insurers important visibility into operator risk and provide operators a standardized framework for cyber risk management. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Join us in Sea Island, Georgia for The Cipher Brief's </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>2025 Threat Conference</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> from October 19-22.

The 2020 bi-partisan Congressional Cyber Solarium Commission (CSC) made recommendations for \u201coperationalizing cybersecurity collaboration\u201d in relevant information sharing between the government and private sector. </p><p>President Joe Biden\u2019s <a href=\"https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/nsm/nsm-22.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>2024 National Security Memorandum on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience (NSM-22)</u></a> built on the CSC\u2019s Congressional consensus by establishing \u201cthe appropriate sharing of timely, actionable information\u201d through a \u201crobust information sharing environment\u201d that enables actions and outcomes that reduce cyber risk. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/topics/partnerships-and-collaboration/joint-cyber-defense-collaborative\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC)</u></a> established by Congress under the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) through the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act provides the ideal structure for gathering and processing CIC data. </p><p><strong>How CICs Would Work in Action</strong></p><p>The government and insurance providers would leverage CIC data to monitor each operator\u2019s progress (or lack thereof) in meeting their standards and determine action based on the risks posed to the American people.</p><p>For instance, the government and insurers would set a ground truth of \u201cgood\u201d cybersecurity standards for a local water utility. The water utility\u2019s CIC would continuously monitor its cyber risks against the sector\u2019s ground truth. The water operator, the government, and insurance companies would be informed of whether the utility complies and how well it performs compared to other operators. </p><p>Through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), industry regulators, and potential reinsurance vehicles, the government would work with the insurance industry to mandate compliance or the water utility would be denied cyber insurance coverage. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Sign up for the </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Cyber Initiatives Group</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

The federal government would use CIC insights to invest intelligently in cyber grants for cash-poor state and local entities such as water utilities. Through these smart grants, the government would assume the role of \u201ccyber insurer of last resort\u201d, shifting the risk of catastrophic cyber-attacks from the weakest and most vulnerable operators to the federal government. </p><p>The CIC insights would also inform and bolster CISA\u2019s JCDC efforts to protect vulnerable operators and, where necessary, engage the unique capabilities of the <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/About/Cybersecurity-Collaboration-Center/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>National Security Agency\u2019s Cybersecurity Collaboration Center (CCC)</u></a>.</p><p>Finally, the administration could unleash a private sector boom in cybersecurity and risk management innovation by enabling technology solution providers to conduct the CIC standards audits. Beyond creating a market for audits, the government could share anonymized versions of the overall pool of CIC data to enable private sector partners to develop and train better cyber solutions. </p><p><strong>America\u2019s Common Defense, Built on Public-Private Collaboration</strong></p><p>Vulnerable populations in medieval times responded to existential threats by collaborating for a \u201ccommon defense\u201d through the construction of walls around their villages. From our nation\u2019s very beginning it was the federal government that maintained a \u201ccommon defense\u201d for our citizens, consistently relying upon, amongst other things, two great oceans, and mostly friendly neighbors to the north and south to serve as 20th century defensive walls to protect us. </p><p>In 2025, the new Trump Administration has a unique opportunity to build a new public-private collaboration framework that builds cyber \u201cwalls\u201d to fill remaining digital gaps and effectively provides for our national \u201ccommon cyber defense\u201d.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/netanyahu-trump",
    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT Q&amp;A \u2014 </strong><em><em>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in Washington D.C. on Monday to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House \u2014 their third meeting this year. Netanyahu\u2019s visit follows the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran last month. Two items are at the top of Trump\u2019s agenda for the meeting: a ceasefire deal on Gaza, and a nuclear deal with Iran.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Before Netanyahu touched down in the U.S., The Cipher Brief spoke with Ambassador Gary Grappo, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Oman and Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, to discuss the dynamics and outcomes he is on the lookout for at the Trump-Netanyahu meeting. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. You can watch the full discussion on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaxOCtsvOjE\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief YouTube Channel</a>.</em></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>What are you going to be looking for as this meeting unfolds?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>The last time the president and Mr. Netanyahu met, it was very much a Trump-dominated visit. They had a public event in which Mr. Netanyahu shockingly spoke very, very little and even seemed a bit submissive. I'll be interested to see how that dynamic plays out in this visit. I expect it to be very, very different. And secondly, looking at the actual specifics, what comes out of this, what they discuss, what are the issues that they focus on and address, the circumstances of this visit, of course, are very, different from Mr. Netanyahu's previous visits to the White House since Trump took office. </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>We know President Trump is very much interested in a deal on the war in Gaza, and also vis-a-vis Iran. It does seem that Prime Minister Netanyahu may be a little less eager. Let's talk about Gaza first. The U.S. hasn't had much success in this administration or the Biden administration before it in pressuring or using its leverage against Israel to get any changes in terms of the prosecution of that war. Do you think it's a different circumstance now?</p><p> <em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>It is a different circumstance. Certainly the dynamic in Gaza has changed very, very little since the last time they met. The Israelis unquestionably hold the upper hand. They literally control between 60-70 percent of the territory of Gaza. They're continuing their efforts to root out Hamas throughout the territory, as challenging as that is now since they're more dispersed, deeply hidden and it's requiring that the IDF to employ different tactics than they may have earlier on in the war.</p><p>But what has really changed is Iran and what has taken place in Iran over the course of the last month to six weeks, with Iran now greatly weakened. Its threat in terms of its nuclear weapons is much diminished thanks primarily to the efforts of the Israelis, but also to the United States and specifically the decision of Donald Trump to enter the war as he did with the dropping of those bunker buster bombs. So there'll be a bit of a good feeling coming out of that, and deservedly so for both sides. And that is going to factor in, I think, into the conversation they have about Gaza.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>Is it essentially that Trump may feel the U.S. did what Israel had been asking us to do for some time with those bunker busters against Iran, and now we'd like Israel to come to the table and push the Gaza deal over the line, assuming, of course, that Hamas is OK with some of those final provisions? Is that the game here?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>That\u2019s certainly one factor here. Donald Trump did jump into a fray that he initially was very reluctant to join \u2014 he had said so publicly before Israel started its first series of attacks on Iran earlier in June. There\u2019ll be something of that in Donald Trump's conversation with Bibi, but also the fact that now with the great danger tamed in Iran, Bibi has much more room for maneuver, including from right-wing members who have threatened to leave his coalition unless he followed a pretty hard-line approach to Gaza, but also Iran. They may be less of a threat now, given the fact that the threat from Iran has diminished.</p><p>And there's a third factor here, and Donald Trump has hinted to this in the last week to 10 days, and that is the charges hanging over Bibi Netanyahu's head. Donald Trump has intimated making a statement that these charges should be dismissed. Mr. Trump is very, very popular in Israel, and if he's making statements like this, which is inserting himself into the judicial process in Israel in a very direct way, it can have a very telling effect on Netanyahu's right wing \u2014 even if they threaten to leave, Mr. Netanyahu may stand a better chance in any elections which might result from the collapse of his coalition.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Apply for a seat at the table today.</em></strong></em></u></a></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>Let's go to Iran. Donald Trump would love what he would consider a good deal with Iran. Netanyahu and that right flank, not so much.</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>No, not at all. Trump very, very much fears getting drawn into another Middle East war and to allow the Israelis to press the advantage, which they may very well do even without the United States. There\u2019s the fear that once again, the Americans may be drawn into the conflict, particularly given the likelihood that the Iranians are going to move to expedite the development of their weapons program, whatever its current state may be. And there seems to still be some question about how much of the more highly enriched uranium they have, how many centrifuges they may still have and where they are located, which could require another American intervention. And I think Trump is fearful of that.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>The question of the Trump administration's leverage is interesting. I was struck by the fact that during that period when a ceasefire was first agreed to, to end this recent 12-day campaign in Iran, there was a moment when President Trump took to social media to say to the Israelis, stop those bombers. It does seem like at least for the short term, he'd like the Israelis to lay low, right?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>Absolutely. Don't forget Mr. Trump has his right wing to answer to as well. It was known from the outset that some of his more hardline supporters were very much opposed to the American intervention in Iran and still are despite the obvious success of the American involvement. They really would like to see us close the book on our intervention there because they also see a real danger of the Americans being further entrapped, they would say, in another Middle East war if the Israelis decide, as you say, to press the advantage.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>We spoke soon after President Trump had announced his arrangement under which the U.S. would take control in Gaza. Whatever happened to that?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>It has been forgotten, but I think it's been put on the shelf, which in fact has become a library of plans for settling the Israeli-Palestinian dispute that never get implemented. I just don't see it as a possibility. What we're currently discussing is a ceasefire, and there are some signs that Hamas may be taking it a little more seriously than they have previously. The Israelis have indicated their willingness to accept it, although I'm sure there are some caveats. But what the administration would like to see is the ceasefire go into effect with assurances provided by the United States that negotiations for a permanent end to the conflict would continue during this 60-day period. And I'm not sure the Israelis are prepared to agree to that. I'll have to see. I'm sure that'll be a discussion point when they meet.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

They do not want to see a continuation of an active conflict in Iran. So they will be hoping that the president can keep the lid on that.</p><p>And then secondly, for Mr. Trump, [the normalization of Israeli-Saudi ties] still remains his ace in the hole. This is something that Bibi Netanyahu very, very much wants to have \u2014 it would be a signature achievement, but that's going to require an acceptable solution to the war in Gaza. And so that's an ace in the hole for Trump if he decides to play it, if he has spoken at all with the Saudis about this possibility. They have previously indicated their hesitancy to enter into any normalization talks without a clear path toward a Palestinian state. They might be willing to accept some general verbiage around that point without necessarily committing to a Palestinian state in terms of a time frame. But they very much want to see an end to this war and a change in the predicament of the Palestinian people of Gaza who still remain suffering, huddled up in a very, very small area with food shortages, even famine and starvation in some areas. A massive humanitarian effort is going to be necessary.</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> on YouTube?

Netanyahu continues to push a no-holds-barred war in Gaza and an uncompromising position on Iran and its nuclear program; Donald Trump is looking to make deals on both fronts.</p><p>Publicly, Trump and Netanyahu will no doubt cheer the success of recent strikes against Iran and the coordination that was evident between the two nations during that 12-day war. In the wake of those attacks, Trump offered to negotiate with Iran, and he has repeatedly urged Israel and Hamas to accept what he calls a \u201cfinal proposal\u201d for a Gaza truce. </p><p>These are the latest in a series of efforts the President has made to make peace on the global stage. As a candidate, Trump promised quick solutions to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and since his second inaugural, he has expended significant diplomatic efforts on Iran and global trade disputes as well. And other than a few trade agreements, he has made no major deals as yet. Might the Netanyahu visit change that? </p><p>Experts say the hurdles involve domestic pressures on the Israeli Prime Minister, who has shown little interest in deals that don\u2019t suit the right-wing nationalists in his government.</p><p>\u201cFor Netanyahu, there are domestic political concerns that are influencing his enthusiasm about proceeding with a ceasefire [in Gaza] or formal negotiations with Iran,\u201d Jason Campbell, Senior Fellow at The Middle East Institute, told The Cipher Brief. \u201cI think that will continue to be a flashpoint in his discussions with President Trump.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Ambassador Gary Grappo, whose diplomatic career included high-level postings in Oman, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, said that Trump\u2019s decision to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2013 something Netanyahu clearly wanted the U.S. to do \u2013 may help him press the Israeli leader to halt his campaign in Gaza.</p><p>\u201cDonald Trump jumped into a fray that initially he was very reluctant to join, and had said so publicly before Israel started its first series of attacks on Iran,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. He expects Trump to use that \u201cbig favor to Israel,\u201d as he called it, in his discussions with Netanyahu. </p><p><strong>A rare rift</strong></p><p>Although President Trump has boasted frequently of his close relationship to Israel \u2013 the country \u201chas never had a better friend in the White House,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/8/trump-tells-jewish-americans-he-is-israels-best-friend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a> during his first term. But he has stymied Netanyahu several times since his return to office. </p><p>The last time the Israeli Prime Minister came to the White House, Trump refused to give him a green light for attacking Iran, and just days before Israel\u2019s strikes last month, he <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/trump-told-netanyahu-not-strike-iran-nuclear\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said publicly</a> that such attacks would be \u201cinappropriate.\u201d </p><p>Earlier this year, Netanyahu <a href=\"https://jweekly.com/2025/05/07/us-announces-truce-with-houthis-without-telling-israel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">was reportedly furious</a> to learn that the Trump administration had negotiated directly with Hamas to free U.S. hostages, and that the White House had ended its campaign against Houthi militants without informing Israel. It didn\u2019t help matters that when Trump took his four-day visit to the Middle East in May, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mideast-trump-israel-diplomacy-saudi-syria-gaza-5d20c749f79b3e5c7b78def1d6588334\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he chose</a> to leave Israel off the itinerary.</p><p>After that trip, former White House Middle East adviser Dennis Ross<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/trumps-gulf-tour-the-money-deals-the-diplomacy-and-what-comes-next\" target=\"_self\"> told The Cipher Brief</a> that \u201cthe Israelis are learning that President Trump is going to do what he decides is in our interests \u2013 we've seen a pattern recently of, \u2018We'll do what we want, and it doesn't necessarily mean we feel their interests have to be taken into account.\u2019\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a rupture of the relationship, Ross said, but it was highly unusual for a self-proclaimed \u201cbest friend\u201d of Israel. </p><p>The June 22 U.S. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts-assess-strikes-response-and-what-comes-next\" target=\"_self\">bunker-buster strikes</a> \u2013 which some referred to as a \u201cfavor\u201d to Israel \u2013 appear to have swung the U.S.-Israel pendulum back in a more favorable direction. <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-thanks-trump-for-support-tells-iranians-your-liberation-from-tyranny-is-closer-than-ever/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netanyahu said</a> as much last week, thanking Trump for his \u201csteadfast stance\u201d on Iran and his overall support of Israel. \u201cI thank him for his consistent support of our country,\u201d he said.</p><p><strong>Deal or no deal, part one: The Gaza war</strong></p><p>Since the strikes against Iran, Trump has been pressing Netanyahu hard \u2013 demanding almost, that he finalize a proposed 60-day ceasefire deal with Hamas. </p><p>This week, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-07-02-2025-111a1cf968318cb0fb6d9865a3ac84dc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump wrote</a> on social media that Israel had \u201cagreed to the necessary conditions to finalize\u201d the ceasefire, \u201cduring which time we will work with all parties to end the War.\u201d The<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-negotiations.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> outlines of the deal</a> include the release of the hostages \u2013 there are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-hostages-released-76f4aef0816546f5048ca881bcd32e4b\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">about 50</a> remaining in Gaza, and authorities believe fewer than half of them are still be alive.

I don't think that's what Netanyahu would want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is some distance between the positions of Mr. Trump and the Israeli government, including Mr. Netanyahu, on Iran,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cAnd don't forget Mr. Trump has his right wing to answer to as well. It was known from the outset that some of his more hardline supporters were very much opposed to the American intervention in Iran and still are\u2026They also see a real danger of the Americans being further entrapped in another Middle East war if the Israelis decide to press the advantage.\u201d</p><p><strong>The Saudi factor \u2013 and the Gaza \u201cRiviera\u201d</strong></p><p>Beyond Gaza and Iran, President Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d Middle East deal involves another major power in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia. Trump\u2019s singular foreign policy achievement during his first term was the so-called Abraham Accords, which produced peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. And he has made clear his wish to bring Saudi Arabia into those agreements.</p><p>The Biden administration was pursuing a Saudi-Israeli rapprochement as well, but all progress on that front ended abruptly with the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and the war on Gaza that followed. Saudi Arabia has insisted on a peace deal in Gaza and a plan for a Palestinian state as prerequisites for entering into any deal with the Israelis. Trump would love to be seen as the architect of this new and potentially critical piece of the Abraham Accords, and certainly the Israelis would love to see it happen. </p><p>\u201cFor Mr. Trump, this still remains his ace in the hole,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cIt's something that Bibi Netanyahu very, very much wants to have. It would be a signature achievement to have normalization of Israeli-Saudi ties, but that's going to require an acceptable solution to the war in Gaza. And so that's an ace in the hole for Trump if he decides to play it.\u201d</p><p>One thing is clear, as Netanyahu heads for Washington: Trump\u2019s last big plan for Gaza \u2013 the idea that the U.S. would take over the territory and create a real-estate bonanza on the \u201cRiviera\u201d \u2013 is no longer in the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI think it's been forgotten,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cOr at least it's been put on the shelf, and that shelf has over the years, become a library of plans for settling the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>It pays to be a Subscriber+Member.

    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/to-counter-china-reform-u-s-intelligence-for-the-digital-age",
    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION --</strong> The United States is facing a quiet and rapidly growing threat across the digital landscape, an unseen mathematical space of binary code and shadowy actors. This landscape demands more, not less, attention, and urgently, if the U.S. is to win the strategic competition of this generation.</p><p>The most sophisticated and ambitious of our adversaries is the government of the People's Republic of China in Beijing, which is pursuing an aggressive national strategy to undermine America's digital future.</p><p>More than 20 years have passed since the last major reorganization of the U.S. intelligence community. In that time, the adversarial threat landscape has changed dramatically, and technology has become central to the intelligence mission. With ever-increasing demands being placed on the Intelligence Community (IC) in a time of fiscal constraint, it is right to ask whether it is optimized for the emerging threats of tomorrow. It is not.</p><p>Given these stakes, lawmakers and national security leaders debating the most significant reforms since 2004 face a critical choice: focus on the real challenges posed by China's digital strategy or become mired in bureaucratic reshuffling.</p><p>The current debate in Washington, focused on the Intelligence Community Efficiency and Effectiveness Act of 2025, exemplifies this risk. It proposes substantial cuts and a restructuring of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which has indeed grown beyond its envisioned size and narrow mission. While ODNI's future size and structure merit discussion, that topic should not distract policymakers with arguments over bureaucratic power, resources, and prestige while missing the bigger, more urgent picture.</p><p>The true measure of reform should not be judged by organizational charts, which rarely impact mission success. The core issues are aligning skills and resources with our most pressing challenges, eliminating bureaucracy that fails to contribute meaningfully to the mission, and unleashing American innovation. Importantly, it is also the candid acknowledgment that espionage demands audacity, agility and risk in the field and in the technical ops center, the so-called pointy end of the spear. Yet institutional incentives often discourage the calculated risks essential to effective intelligence work, creating structural barriers to the bold action required in today's digital intelligence mission.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em></em></p><p>A central challenge faced by the IC is the PRC's aggressive national digital strategy, which explicitly aims for global dominance in artificial intelligence by 2030. Beijing views AI as critical infrastructure for national security and geopolitical influence, backing it with extensive state investment and a military-civil fusion program to weaponize civilian technology. To effectively counter this, the U.S. IC must achieve and maintain dominance in all digital domains where China's advancements are most pronounced.</p><p>Cyber Collection and Defense: China increasingly leverages AI-driven automation to conduct sophisticated cyber espionage, systematically compromising critical U.S. infrastructure, intellectual property, and defense-related information. Yet our current cyber capabilities are hampered by antiquated acquisition processes that treat software like hardware, sometimes taking years to field capabilities that adversaries deploy on rapid timelines.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence: Beijing uses powerful AI algorithms to analyze vast datasets, including the personal and biometric data of Americans, to significantly enhance the precision and scale of its espionage. Meanwhile, IC agencies struggle with bureaucratic barriers that prevent rapid adoption of commercial AI tools and make it difficult to partner with smaller tech companies who are leading innovation in this space.</p><p>Strategic Data Acquisition: China's comprehensive data strategy treats information as a strategic asset, harvesting it from commercial, governmental, and individual sources to fuel its AI systems. Naturally, the IC\u2019s ability to leverage open-source data is limited by its available budget, but this is an area worthy of modest additional investment to benefit the mission of all IC members.</p><p>Information Operations: Chinese state actors utilize generative AI tools, including advanced deepfakes and social media manipulation, to propagate disinformation, deepen societal divisions, and reshape the global digital landscape to align with China's objectives. The IC must quickly improve its ability to identify and counter such efforts at scale and at machine speed, which will require investment in sophisticated technical capabilities now, not someday.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Upgrade your access to exclusive content by <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\">becoming a subscriber</a>.</strong> </em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Real reform demands breaking and rebuilding an outdated acquisitions process designed for analog-era weapon systems. Consider this reality: while China can deploy new cyber capabilities on rapid timelines, the IC can take up to two years to procure and field comparable digital tools due to processes designed for a bygone analog era. Creating fast-track authorities means establishing dedicated pathways where software and digital services can be evaluated, tested, and deployed within weeks rather than following traditional procurement timelines. This also requires a concerted effort to drive genuine partnerships between government and private industry, the true engines of innovation, by creating new pathways for tech talent to serve short tours in government and streamlining how the IC adopts commercial technology.</p><p>Critics rightfully worry that rapid acquisition could compromise security or oversight. The solution is not slower processes, but smarter ones that leverage new AI capabilities by creating streamlined security reviews specifically designed for software, implementing continuous monitoring instead of front-loaded approvals (the one-and-done approach), and building accountability mechanisms that match the speed of digital threats.</p><p>The goal of intelligence reform should be clear: promote a culture of bold risk-taking, eliminate bureaucracy where it merely perpetuates itself, ruthlessly drive efficiency to free up precious resources, and reallocate those resources to the challenges of the future rather than the structures of the past. This requires immediate action from Congress to establish new acquisition authorities, from IC leadership to restructure internal processes, and from the private sector to engage more deeply with national security missions.</p><p>It would be a mistake to squander precious time in debates over bureaucratic power while our adversaries move forward aggressively. The United States must match and surpass their speed, innovation, and audacity, focusing exclusively on the real challenges ahead to secure America's digital future.

U.S. forces are deemed potential targets of retaliation and one U.S. airbase in Qatar did come under attack, albeit a largely symbolic one.</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Cipher Brief spoke with General Frank McKenzie (Ret.), who oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East as the head of U.S. Central Command from 2019 to 2022, about the mission and vulnerability of U.S. troops in the region, and what might happen if they were to leave. Our interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>The Iraq War is long over. The United States - in a coalition - defeated ISIS some time ago. The Afghan War is over. What is the mission or are the missions of all those troops that remain in the Middle East?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie: </em></strong></em>I would argue that the fight against ISIS still goes on. We don't actually fight that fight ourselves, but we do support our partners both in Iraq and in Syria who continue to conduct operations against ISIS, which is now newly flourishing based on the turmoil in Syria. That may correct itself over the next few months with the new government, which I think is a good thing. So we're still in that fight a little bit. But to your basic question, our forces are there to train our partners in the region, to work with them, to provide assurance of American presence, and that's largely focused on Iran. Iran remains a singular threat in the region, and we've seen over the last few months, why we need to be very aware and alert to the threat from Iran.</p><p>The other thing is that while we do have a lot of forces in the region, they are distributed. We defended ourselves very effectively against an Iranian attack a few days ago. And forces also provide assurance to our neighbors while they deter action by our potential opponents. Our friends in the region can't leave. They're stuck there, so the fact that U.S. forces are there actually adds to their level of assurance that we'll be a reliable partner should Iran attack them.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>A good many of those American troops are there at the invitation, if not the request, of some of the Gulf states. That's of course not the case for different reasons in Iraq and Syria. To what extent is the U.S. presence, in your view, an answer to those kinds of requests? And to what extent is it strategically smart for the United States?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie:</em></strong></em> It\u2019s a combination of both. It certainly serves our interest to maintain a presence in the region. It certainly serves the interests of the Gulf States and other states that we be there in order to give them additional stability as they confront the threat from Iran. So I think it serves both our interests. We\u2019re actually in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government now. I think we have an ongoing negotiation process with the Iraqis about what our force posture is going to be. So we're in Iraq because the Iraqis want us to be there, not because we're forcing ourselves on the Iraqis.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

We could leave the region, and that's talked about fairly frequently. If we left the region and drew down dramatically, then that assurance component would go away and they would also be, as an effective operational matter, far more vulnerable to attacks from Iran. We've seen how willing Iran is to actually use their military to attack their neighbors over the last few months. That's the thing to cover when we look at why our forces are there: what effects do we derive? Assurance and deterrence against Iranian attacks. </p><p>I think those are all useful things because that keeps the flow of commerce through the region, moving through the Strait of Hormuz. We've reopened the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait recently. I believe commerce is eventually going to flow again, though that's going to take a little time as insurance companies test the waters about what the Houthis are going to be willing to do. But all of those things are very much in our national interest.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>Let's talk about the vulnerability of some of those forces. You've had all those forces under your command. How difficult a task is it to go from whatever the baseline force protection is to us now attacking the nation of Iran? What's the ramp up like in terms of security?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie:</em></strong></em> We have exquisitely rehearsed and prepared plans to protect our forces. As the CENTCOM commander, you begin every day worrying about the force protection level of U.S. forces in the region, our embassies in the region, our American citizens in the region, as well as our friends and partners. So you look at that every day and you balance it against what the Iranians are doing. We have very good ways of knowing what the Iranians are thinking about and what they plan to do. So as we saw recently, we are typically able to adjust and prepare for that. The risk is always that you'll get it wrong or they'll get lucky, and we know and understand that. But we work very closely with forces in the region to ensure they're prepared for these types of things. It's a battle drill. It is an onerous thing to do. You're leaving the comfortable places you live. You're going to places that are certainly less comfortable, albeit for a short period of time, but it's one of the best ways we can effectively save the Iranians from themselves. If they were to attack us and cause significant U.S. casualties, then the potential for upward escalation is very high. We always say the Iranians own the lower steps on the escalation ladder. We own all the higher steps on the escalation ladder. Every CENTCOM commander spends a lot of time looking at that.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em>Sign up today</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em>.</em></strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>What would go away for the United States if those troops were to come home or go elsewhere?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie: </em></strong></em>It's a careful calibration. You may not need as much as you've got right now. You need the ability to flow them back in very quickly if you elect to pull forces out. But what we have right now is an Iran that is effectively deterred. They chose not to launch a massive attack on us. Instead, they launched a very choreographed attack, and if we're to believe reporting, that was telegraphed well in advance because they did not want to get into significant combat with the United States \u2014 because they know and understand our capabilities. That's what these forces bring. To draw down precipitously would possibly undo that deterrent effect.</p><p>On the other hand, and this is something that really only the president of the United States can balance, he's a president who has struck Iran twice \u2014 [Quds Force Commander, General] <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/avenging-the-death-of-qassem-soleimani\" target=\"_self\"><u>Qassem Soleimani</u></a> back in 2020, and now this most recent attack. President Trump possesses extraordinary credibility with the Iranians because he's taken bold action two times, which puts him in a unique position that no other American president has had going back several administrations. </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em>D</em><em>o you think that President Trump might have some success in bringing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a place that looks more like a ceasefire in Gaza and a deal in Iran?</em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie: </em></strong></em>Short answer is, I don't know. I do know that we and Israel both share the same objective with Iran. We don't want them to have a nuclear weapon, and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of discussion on that, a lot of assessment. How effective were the strikes? Where are we? What needs to be done? I would assume they're going to spend a fair amount of time talking about that. But I would also say the same thing I said about President Trump and Iran. That same credibility probably extends to his relationship with Israel and the way going forward. So I'll watch with great interest to see what comes out of those meetings next week.</p><p><em><strong><em>Are you Subscribed to </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> on YouTube?

The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>\u201cIt certainly serves our interest to maintain a presence in the region,\u201d Gen. McKenzie said. \u201cAnd it certainly serves the interests of the Gulf states and other states as well that we be there in order to give them additional stability as they confront the threat from Iran.\u201d</p><p>The focus on the U.S. presence in the Middle East comes early on in an administration that has indicated it may want to pivot from a focus on the region and shift attention toward Asia. But testifying just prior to the U.S. attack in Iran, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, who was <a href=\"https://defensescoop.com/2025/06/30/combatant-commanders-centcom-eucom-brad-cooper-alexus-grynkewich/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed just this week</a> as the new CENTCOM commander, said he sees no reason to draw down now. </p><p>\u201cOur approach today is to assess and move forward on a conditions-based assessment,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he told</a> the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cI think, given the dynamic nature of what's happening today, that assessment in the future could look different than it does today, perhaps, and if confirmed, I'm committed into my tenure to continue to assess what our posture needs to look like and make recommendations.\u201d</p><p><strong>What are U.S. Troops Doing There</strong></p><p>For decades, the United States has kept tens of thousands of military personnel in the Middle East, spread across bases from Syria to the Persian Gulf. </p><p>Among the largest are the <a href=\"https://greydynamics.com/al-udeid-air-base-the-largest-us-military-installation-in-middle-east/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Al -Udeid Air Base</a> in Qatar, home to the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing and the forward headquarters of CENTCOM \u2013 with some 10,000 troops \u2013 and the U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet base <a href=\"https://installations.militaryonesource.mil/in-depth-overview/naval-support-activity-bahrain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in Bahrain</a>, where 9,000 Americans are deployed. 13,500 U.S. service members are stationed at <a href=\"http://v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bases in Kuwait</a> and another 5,000 in the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/12/mapping-us-troops-and-military-bases-in-the-middle-east\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">United Arab Emirates (UAE).</a> Maritime deployments that followed the Hamas massacre in Israel on October 7, 2023, added a few thousand troops to the overall number. Finally, roughly 3,000 Americans are stationed at bases in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/after-iran-proxy-strikes-should-u-s-troops-leave-iraq-and-syria\" target=\"_self\">Iraq and Syria,</a> vestiges of the anti-ISIS operations that were carried out a decade ago. </p><p>Proponents of the current force posture see a smart distribution of troops that matches U.S. interests and furthers several key missions: the ability to respond quickly to crises; countering the Iranian threat; bolstering the defense of Israel; helping secure maritime commerce in the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz; maintaining U.S. relations with key Gulf allies; and ensuring that ISIS and other groups do not reconstitute themselves and threaten U.S. interests. </p><p>\u201cThere are multiple missions at play,\u201d Cohen said, beyond the current operations against Iran. \u201cSome of this is a legacy of the global war on terrorism. We have soldiers in Syria and Iraq, doing primarily counter-ISIS missions, some stabilization missions as well. But we also have the major air bases in Bahrain for the Air Force and the Navy, managing air operations and the naval forces in the region. And what that means in practice, is we are concerned about the free flow of commerce through places like the Strait of Hormuz, and making sure that the Houthis don\u2019t interfere with global maritime traffic there as well.\u201d </p><p>Those arguing for a drawdown say that a force of 40,000 is far too costly, and that the stated missions are either outdated or could be accomplished with a much smaller number of troops. </p><p>\u201cMy longer-term view \u2013 even before the Iran strike \u2013 of the forces in the Middle East has been that when you have 40,000 forces in a region, anything that happens in that region implicates the United States, even things that actually aren't in U.S. interests,\u201d Kavanagh, the Defense Priorities director, told <em>The Cipher Brief.</em></p><p>\u201cTo the extent that we can get those forces out and limit unnecessary entanglements, I think that would be a smart move,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that doesn't necessarily mean that you could never operate in the Middle East if there were actually a threat. Air power and naval power is something that's very mobile, and if you had the support of the Gulf countries, you could operate from those bases again.\u201d</p><p><strong>The war against ISIS</strong></p><p>Officially, U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria serve as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, which began as a U.S.-led coalition in 2014 to dismantle the Islamic State (ISIS). Although that campaign was declared a success in Iraq (in 2017) and in Syria (2019), the U.S. maintains nearly 3,500 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/24/us-troops-attacked-syria-iraq-israel-hamas-gaza/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">troops</a> in the two countries. </p><p>Those bases are also considered the most vulnerable to outside attack, and well before the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes against Iran, analysts and policymakers were questioning the wisdom of keeping them there.</p><p>After Israel launched its war on Hamas in October 2023, these bases \u2013 along with a smaller outpost in Jordan \u2013 were attacked hundreds of times by rocket strikes that reportedly caused <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/40-us-service-members-may-brain-injuries-iran-linked-attacks-rcna123591\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dozens</a> of traumatic brain injuries among U.S. troops. In January 2024, three Americans <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/tower-22-and-the-path-to-a-wider-war\" target=\"_self\">were killed</a> and dozens were injured at the small \u201cTower 22\u201d base in Jordan. As <em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/tower-22-and-the-path-to-a-wider-war\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a></em> reported then, the deadly strike prompted calls for ending the Iraq and Syria deployments.</p><p>Bernard Hudson, a former director of counterterrorism at the CIA, told us then that U.S. troops in those countries were \u201cfolks in harm\u2019s way who can\u2019t be protected and are surrounded by Iranian elements in both countries.\u201d </p><p>Today, the case for staying in Syria and Iraq imagines a different nightmare: the Americans leave, and conditions are restored for a resurgent ISIS that could do more damage in the region and beyond. </p><p>\u201cI would argue that the fight against ISIS still goes on,\u201d Gen. McKenzie said. \u201cWe don't actually do that fight ourselves, but we do support our partners both in Iraq and in Syria who continue to conduct operations against ISIS, which is now newly flourishing based on the turmoil in Syria.\u201d </p><p>Cohen concurred. \u201cISIS is beaten down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not gone, though. And the concern is if you begin to take forces away, ISIS will sprout back up. There are also concerns that if we pull out, particularly out of Syria, we will risk abandoning the Kurds, who've been a long-time partner. So, there's an argument for keeping troops there for a host of both counterterrorism reasons, but also for regional stability issues.\u201d</p><p>Kavanagh countered that the threat to the U.S. was minimal, and not worth the investment in U.S. military force. </p><p>\u201cISIS is not a threat to the United States \u2013 at least not the ISIS that's operating in the Middle East,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people argue that ISIS-K is becoming a more global threat, but they're not in Iraq and Syria. And our intelligence community has been very effective at uncovering plots before they happen. So, I'm not convinced that you need a military presence to protect the United States from that threat.\u201d</p><p>The Defense Department has been conducting a \u201cposture review\u201d of the Iraq and Syria deployments for more than a year. The Iraq Higher Military Commission, which was tasked with preparing a U.S. withdrawal plan from that country, hasn\u2019t met since September, <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">according to <em>Defense One</em>.</a> Recently, Maine Senator Angus King returned from a visit to Iraq and said that officials there had asked for the American troops to remain. </p><p>\u201cThey have an election coming up this fall, and that's been one of the significant dangers,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sen. King said</a>, referring to potential threats from Iran-backed militias in Iraq. \u201cIt seems to me, given the renewed volatility\u2026it\u2019s not a good time to be drawing down our forces, because they are viewed as stabilizing forces in all of those countries in the Middle East.\u201c</p><p><strong>A rapid-reaction force \u2013 and the costs</strong></p><p>Many experts say that the brief war with Iran \u2013 and the tensions that linger in its aftermath \u2013 are only the latest examples of a longstanding reality: crises in the Middle East come with regularity. And that, they say, is reason enough for maintaining the American air and naval bases in the Gulf states. </p><p>Proponents of the U.S. posture also note that those Gulf allies want the Americans there. The U.S. has mutual defense agreements and commitments with Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain. An abrupt exit, they argue, could undermine relationships with those countries.</p><p>\u201cThere's a geopolitical bent here in that the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, they all value having a U.S. presence in the region,\u201d Jason Campbell, Senior Fellow at the Middle East Institute, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt provides them both a certain level of added security from Iran, as well as additional access for their respective militaries to training and certain types of equipment that are of use to them. So, there are both security and geopolitical reasons for the presence in this part of the world.\u201d</p><p>Detractors point to the costs \u2013 particularly of the larger bases in the Gulf. Sustaining U.S. forces in the Middle East is expensive, north of <a href=\"https://reason.com/2024/10/08/a-year-of-war-in-the-middle-east-cost-americans-nearly-23-billion/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">$20 billion</a> per year. Kavanagh and Caldwell argue that U.S. personnel in the region require more extensive defenses than those based at home, including hardened facilities and advanced air defenses, to protect them from Iranian-backed drone and missile attacks. </p><p>Meanwhile, each uptick in tensions has meant shifts to a high-alert status that carry their own costs. When the U.S. made the decision to strike Iran, most of the aircraft at the al-Udeid base in Qatar were moved out, and ships stationed at the U.S. naval base in Bahrain were sent out to sea as a security precaution. </p><p>\u201cThere is a heightened level of threat there,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThey'll move some of their naval ships out of Bahrain and out to sea to keep them safer\u2026These are typical things we see, leading up to and enduring periods of tension in the region.\u201d</p><p>Ultimately, none of those measures mattered much in the recent war; the Iranians were clearly not interested in escalation, and their public retaliation \u2013 for now at least \u2013 has been limited to a single well-telegraphed strike against the Al-Udeid base, which President Trump said had come with advance warning.</p><p>But Caldwell and Kavanagh argue that the costs and the vulnerability of these bases alone make the case for a drawdown, or at least a consolidation of U.S. forces in the region to one or two locations. </p><p>\u201cThe \u201812-Day War\u2019 fortunately did not cost any American lives,\u201d Caldwell and Kavanagh <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/28/iran-strike-american-military-vulnerability/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> in the Post, \u201cbut it highlighted our vulnerabilities in the region and underlined how our existing force posture was superfluous to achieving our aims. The war\u2019s end provides an opportunity for the United States to do what it has tried and failed to do for the better part of a decade: rationalize and downscale its presence in the Middle East.\u201d</p><p><strong>What comes next</strong> </p><p>All the past calls for a drawdown of American military power in the region ultimately ran into the same roadblock: It\u2019s hard to disengage from the Middle East. </p><p>President Donald Trump ran for a second term on a foreign policy platform that would decrease American involvement in the Middle East and pivot towards growing challenges in the Indo-Pacific. He referred to himself as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/10/trump-war-israel-gaza-ukraine-yemen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\u201ccandidate of peace,\u201d</a> with promises to extricate the U.S. from entanglements in the region. He may still do so; but like many of his predecessors, he has found it difficult to stay out of the region\u2019s turbulence.</p><p>\u201cI'm optimistic that once things stabilize, at least some of the air and naval power will move out of the region, because I do think there are strong voices in the Pentagon and elsewhere who really would like to concentrate more on Asia,\u201d Kavanagh said. \u201cAnd you can't do that when all your air and naval assets are tied up in the Middle East.\u201d</p><p>Even those experts who support the deployments say they welcome the discussions about their future.</p><p>\u201cThere's certainly debate to be had for the number of installations required,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHow many forces should indeed be there and what specific purpose should they serve? I think those are all fair questions, but again, the geopolitical costs of removing forces completely from the region could be higher than many realize.\u201d</p><p>Campbell added that a complete damage assessment of the strikes against Iran \u2013 which is not yet complete \u2013 will likely dictate the way forward, and that until then, there is a \u201cnear-to middle-term utility of having forces and resources in the region just from a more operational standpoint.\u201d</p><p>Cohen agrees, noting that despite Trump\u2019s claim that the nuclear sites in Iran had been \u201cobliterated,\u201d questions remain about the damage done and what may come next. </p><p>\u201cThere's an open question about how much destruction we actually did to the nuclear program with that strike,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAnd if you were to have a more sustained [U.S.] offensive, and if you actually wanted to do something somewhat larger that would actually have potentially a more permanent effect, you would need a bigger operation.\u201d And that, he said, would surely involve the American bases in the Gulf.</p><p>Gen. McKenzie, the former CENTCOM commander, said he welcomes the coming \u201cposture review,\u201d and the overall debate about U.S. forces in the Middle East. </p><p>\u201cThat's a national policy decision that we're going to have to make,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much do we want to leave in there? It's a careful calibration. You may not need as much as you've got right now, but you need the ability to flow them back in very quickly if you elect to pull forces out.\u201d</p><p>Ultimately, he said, \u201cWe could leave the region, we could certainly do that, and that's talked about fairly frequently.\u201d But he added that in the short term, that would hurt the U.S. deterrent effect against Iran, the ability to secure safe maritime commerce, and the relationship with those Gulf allies. </p><p>\u201cI think that's the thing to cover when we look at why are our forces there, what effects do they give, what effects do we derive from the fact that they're there \u2013 I think those are all useful things. All of those things are very much in our national interest.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

Litvinenko\u2019s resulting death from acute radiation syndrome significantly strained relations between the UK and Russia, leading to diplomatic expulsions and increased scrutiny of Russian activities in the UK.</p><p>As much as this event became pivotal in the relationships between London and Moscow and called for a major reassessment of the Kremlin\u2019s intentions and capabilities on European soil, it was still regarded by the rest of Europe mostly as a matter of Russia\u2019s internal issues \u2014 Litvinenko was Russian, he ardently criticised the Russian leadership and he was a high-ranking defector. Therefore, he was targeted by the Russian special services. The consensus in the West was that Russia targeted its own renegade citizens, and not citizens from European countries.</p><p>This proved to be a rather comfortable position for the political leadership of the EU at that time (primarily German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy), which was in the middle of exploring deeper economic ties and a more intertwined commerce with Russia.</p><p>This position allowed the economic and political powerhouses of Europe to safely qualify Moscow\u2019s explicitly hostile actions around the same time towards countries like Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Georgia as mere quarrels between the former Soviet republics. The Kremlin\u2019s distribution of Russian passports in Latvia in 2004; the Kremlin\u2019s blockade of rail and ports and manipulation of theDruzhba pipeline oil supply in retaliation for losing the bid for Lithuania\u2019s only oil refinery Ma\u017eeiki\u0173 Nafta; or Russia\u2019s complete ban of imports of Georgian wines as a punishment for Tbilisi\u2019s pro-Western stance in 2006 \u2013 all these events were disregarded as merely regional tensions between the former USSR cohabitants.</p><p>The Swedish airspace incursion that happened the same year, when a Russian military aircraft without active transponders flew simulated attack runs near Gotland, didn\u2019t match this story, but was mainly ignored as an unfortunate mistake in the then non-NATO sky.</p><p>In 2007, when the websites of Estonia\u2019s government, parliament, banks, ministries, newspapers, and broadcasters websites faced the most massive cyber-attack in history, which coincided with a dispute with Russia over the relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, a Soviet-era monument paramount for the Kremlin\u2019s WW2 mythology, the same whispering was heard in EU high cabinets \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a matter of Russia\u2019s backyard\u201d. Nobody would dare to openly call an independent EU state \u201cRussia\u2019s backyard\u201d, but the reaction towards this incident, widely considered the first major state-on-state cyberattack, was telltale.</p><p>The same year, Putin gave his notorious \u2018Munich speech\u2019 \u2014\u2018\u2019The speech in which Putin has told us who he was\u201d, as<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/18/putin-speech-wake-up-call-post-cold-war-order-liberal-2007-00009918\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Politico has put it</u></a>. Among his disturbing and grim messages, one was particularly ominous: \u2018Whether we should be indifferent and aloof to various internal conflicts inside [other] countries? Of course not.\u2019</p><p>This message didn\u2019t take long to materialize. In 2008 Russia invaded Georgia under the pretext of protecting Russian citizens and peacekeepers in the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. This was the climax of the \u201cRussia\u2019s backyard\u201d attitude. Numerous former members of Mikheil Saakashvili\u2019s team, the then-president of Georgia, said that in private conversations with Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel, Condoleezza Rice and their teams, these foreign leaders and their advisors articulated the futility of resistance and the need to accept the reality imposed by the Kremlin. \u201cAccepting this reality\u201d would mean recognizing that Russia does indeed hold a claim on Georgia, which naturally derives from the common soviet history. (Later in 2014 some representatives of the EU behind closed doors were promoting the same thought regarding Crimea).</p><p>Unfortunately, these and many other hostile actions failed to seriously alarm both the American and European political elites of that period, who were seriously engaged in a \u201cRussian reset\u201d. In 2009 Russian military aircraft again violated Swedish airspace, Moscow cut off gas supplies to Ukraine in the dead of winter (affecting also European countries dependent on gas transiting through Ukraine), and Kremlin-backed hackers attacked the German government.</p><p>In the 2010s Russia, either directly or through its proxies, effectuated cyber attacks on the German and Finnish governments, as well as on energy distribution networks in Sweden; sabotaged arms depots in Czechia; stirred up ethnic tensions in Germany with the \u2018Lisa Case\u2019; hacked TV5Monde and manipulated social media to encourage chaos during Yellow Vests protests in France; infiltrated the Aviation Sector and the Spiez laboratory in Switzerland; attempted to assassinate an arms dealer in Bulgaria; and targeted US and Canada diplomats in Cuba and later in other countries (the \u2018Cuba syndrome\u2019).</p><p>Moscow supported anti-fracking movements in Romania to prevent it from developing its own natural gas resources; attempted a coup in Montenegro; jammed Finland\u2019s and Norway\u2019s GPS signals; backed the hacking of the World Anti-Doping Agency; and attempted to sabotage the global internet infrastructure by exploring vulnerabilities in undersea Internet cables connecting Europe and North America.</p><p>Closer to the 2020s Russian operatives attempted to intercept secure military communications from a French military satellite; the Kremlin imposed trade restrictions on Moldovan agricultural products and manipulated energy prices in response to Kishinev\u2019s increased engagement with the EU; and Moscow manipulated the energy market in Bulgaria by restricting gas supplies.</p><p>Russia systematically meddled in top tier popular voting across the globe, with the following being subjects of major investigations for alleged Russian interference: the 2016 UK Brexit referendum, 2016 US presidential elections, 2017 French presidential elections, 2017 German federal elections, 2018 Finnish presidential elections and the 2019 European parliament elections.</p><p>The amount of money and effort spent by the Kremlin to fund and cultivate separatist, xenophobic, anti-Western, Eurosceptic, anti-Americanist, radical, extreme and divisive parties, movements, groups and organizations across the Transatlantic community since Putin came to power is overwhelming.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

For any war to be \u201cnever again\u201d meant that peace must be \u201cforever\u201d. Hence, attaining peace morphed from a righteous and pragmatic complex objective into a quasi-religious ideology that rejects the mere plausibility of conflict \u2013 \u201ca deep peace\u201d.</p><p>A \"Deep peace\" is not merely a state of prolonged absence of war. The doctrine posits that the very discussion of potential martial threats or military readiness could, paradoxically, invoke the specter of war itself. This ideology has been perpetuated by a sustained period of peace which, rather than being seen as a delicate, demanding and maintained state, is viewed as a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>This means that for \u2018peacewalkers\u2019, the modern-day political apostles of this new security cult, peace is self-reinforcing. The longer they can keep the peace, the stronger on their opinion it gets, and the less probable war is. Hence the obsession with preserving peace at all costs, even if such costs are clearly whetting the appetite of the predator, who never really bothered to camouflage his hostile intentions. This almost irrational refusal to accept any possibility of another conflict on the continent, as if it were a fantasy, a fairytale, a myth, has been ruling out the very discussion of the flaws of current peace and its disproportions, as these very discussions were believed to invite war.</p><p>It seems that only at the Munich Security Conference of 2025 western leaders finally realized that war is now not just at their doorstep \u2013 it has already rung the bell.</p><p>This state of \u201cdeep peace\u201d is precisely the reason why all the signals of hostility from Russia have been ignored by the peacewalkers. This was seen in the reaction of the major western governments\u2019 defence budgets to the overt military interventions conducted by Russia in Georgia, in the Middle East and in Ukraine before 2022\u2014the increase of defense spending was literally marginal.</p><p>Both European and American defense spending remained disproportionately low. The European Union's defense budget gradually declined from 4% of GDP in 1960 to a historic low of 1.3% of GDP in 2014. It wasn't until 2020 that European defense spending saw a \u201cnoticeable\u201d increase of 0.3% - up to 1.6% of GDP.</p><p>A similar trend was observed in the United States, where defense spending as a share of GDP stagnated and mostly declined throughout the 2010s, following the peak of the War on Terror. U.S. military expenditure steadily fell from around 4.5% of GDP in 2010 to 3.2% by 2017, even as Russia ramped up its global assertiveness under Putin\u2019s second presidency. It wasn\u2019t until 2020 that U.S. defense spending rebounded to 3.7%, reflecting a shift in priorities as geopolitical tensions escalated.</p><p>The fact that both European and American defense spending remained stagnant for most of the 2010s, suggests that the West did not perceive even Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine as a serious enough threat to warrant an immediate military buildup. This delayed response underscores the extent to which policymakers in both Europe and the U.S. underestimated the long-term implications of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas, as much as Russia being a direct threat.</p><p>Once again, the pervasive\u2014almost sacrosanct\u2014belief in the enduring power of 'deep peace' has led to the deliberate overlooking of clear signals of impending conflict. This illusion of unassailable peace, fostered by decades of relative stability and economic interdependence, has engendered a dangerous complacency among western, but mainly European, nations.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em>Sign up today</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em>.</em></strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>False Idols</strong></p><p>In order to start thinking about how to fix this situation, we first need to understand how we got here. What beliefs guided decision makers? Within what ideological framework did they operate?</p><p>The first reference point is the perception of national security through the lens of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</p><p>The evolution of the role and, more importantly, the capabilities of NATO in the minds of its members happened under the influence of a prolonged peace on the European continent, with some successful military interventions of its members in the 1990s and 2010s, as well as of a certain image of a hi-tech undefeatable army produced by American pop-culture.</p><p>As a result, NATO has become more of a religious icon, rather than a real military force. The belief in NATO\u2019s capacity has become unconditional and it has fastened the religion of \u201cdeep peace\u201d (which is indeed very similar to a religion because of its irrationality), by providing an image of an almighty protector, which will always intervene in case of trouble.</p><p>The truth is, however, a bit different. While NATO might have proven itself successful in regional conflicts like Yugoslavia or the Middle East, it was never ready to face a full-scale war with a proper adversary like Russia or China. It was even less prepared to face hybrid warfare, with war being waged not only with bombs and bullets, but with information and narratives.</p><p>The reliance on nuclear power was paramount in NATO\u2019s deterrence strategy. The war Russia has launched against Ukraine, however, has shown that nuclear weapons deter only the use of other nuclear weapons \u2013 not conventional ones. </p><p>One might argue that the aggression against Ukraine is very different from a hypothetical aggression against NATO, and if Russia were to invade a member of the Treaty the retaliation would be dramatically different. Perhaps. How can, however, the nuclear arsenal defend even member countries against \u2018the green men\u2019, the scam referendums, the total blackouts due to cyber-attacks, the skirmishes with emigrants along the borders, arson of ammunition stores and further hybrid tactics? This begs a clear answer.</p><p>Therefore, a NATO membership can hardly serve as a justification for not having a powerful military able to defend one\u2019s country against an invasion. This, however, was precisely the belief of the \u2018peacewalkers\u2019 for decades: \u2018NATO will take care of us, and it has nukes. We\u2019re safe\u2019.</p><p>Russia has proved them wrong. And now the new White House administration is considering a major NATO policy shift, where the U.S. might not defend a fellow NATO member that is attacked, if the country doesn\u2019t meet the defense spending threshold. Given the alternative view on global security the new U.S. leadership has taken, the moment Washington refuses to invoke Article 5 following a hypothetical encroachment on a member-state \u2013 the world as we know it is finished.</p><p>Another belief where Russia has proved everyone wrong is the na\u00efve idea that it can be deterred by trade. And yet, even the current U.S. administration seems to be falling into this trap once again.</p><p>This illusion has deep roots. Since the early 2000s, the dominant Western orthodoxy held that deeper trade and economic interdependence with Russia would tame its aggressive instincts and gradually bind it to the liberal international order. From Germany\u2019s embrace of <em><em>Wandel durch Handel</em></em> to the U.S. push for Russia\u2019s WTO accession in 2012, the assumption was always the same: prosperity would soften Moscow, and mutual gain would deter aggression.</p><p>It did the opposite.</p><p>The trick is that the fruits and benefits of trade relations are used very differently in democracies and autocracies. While democracies invest the spoils of trade into raising the quality of life of their citizens\u2014because that is the social contract at the heart of their legitimacy\u2014autocratic regimes like Russia spend those same profits on the <em><em>quality of oppression</em></em>: strengthening their propaganda machines and expanding the coercive reach of their security services. These are the twin pillars of modern authoritarian rule.</p><p>In the 2000s, as Russia reaped massive windfalls from energy exports, it poured resources into rebuilding and modernizing its military. Military spending jumped from just $9 billion in 2000 to over $60 billion by 2014. At the same time, Putin\u2019s regime systematically increased funding for the security services and domestic repression apparatus. By 2025, Russia will allocate a staggering 6.3% of its GDP\u2014over $145 billion\u2014to defense, surpassing even Cold War-era levels. In parallel, the budget for internal security, which includes the FSB and National Guard, accounts for over 10% of the federal budget, while state propaganda organs like RT and VGTRK are receiving $1.4 billion annually, an increase of 13% over the previous year.</p><p>Meanwhile, spending on social programs in Russia is projected to fall by 16% in 2025. The regime is not interested in improving the lives of its citizens\u2014it is interested in controlling them.</p><p>Hence, while Russia has been methodically preparing for war, both externally and internally, the West spent the same decades investing in the illusion of a deepening peace. Defense budgets shrank, armies were downsized, and strategic industries were allowed to atrophy. Europe, in particular, funneled billions into Russian energy infrastructure like Nord Stream, while simultaneously allowing itself to become strategically dependent on the very regime it hoped to pacify.</p><p>In the end, the West was trading with Russia under the illusion that it was exporting stability. In reality, it was importing vulnerability.</p><p><strong>Epilogue: the trench of the Saints</strong></p><p>In the end, however, it is not doctrines, nukes, trade or alliances that hold the gates. It is the trench of the saints\u2014where exhausted, ordinary Ukrainians still stand between us and the abyss. </p><p>And yet, instead of standing behind them as one would behind the gates of a besieged city, much of the West regards their resistance with fatigue, irritation, even suspicion\u2014treating Ukraine not as a rampart, but as a liability. The war, they whisper, drags on. The costs are too high. Perhaps it\u2019s time to talk peace, meaning: surrender something, accept something, pretend that nothing essential is lost.</p><p>But what is being lost is everything.</p><p>The trench of the Ukrainian soldier is not only a physical line against Russian advance. It is the symbolic front line of a deeper war\u2014between freedom and tyranny, law and brute force, future and regression. Just as in the 20th century, when the free world had to rally to crush the Nazi regime not with half-measures but with full moral clarity, so too must the West now realize: Ukraine is not the cause of this war\u2019s duration. Ukraine is the reason we still have time.</p><p>If we abandon that trench\u2014or fail to fully support it\u2014we are not avoiding war. We are inviting a greater one.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><em>\u201cOn both sides they imagined that \u2018bluffing\u2019 would suffice to achieve success.

The designation is justified, given Iran\u2019s continued support of proxies and criminal organizations that kill and terrorize innocent people. That behavior continues today, with the government of Ali Hosseini Khamenei surveilling, harassing, and detaining thousands of Iranians for allegedly aiding Israel -- and offending the morality police, who enforce Iran\u2019s dress code for women.</p><p>The U.S. \u2013 Israel bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites in Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow was more than justified. Iran was enriching uranium at 60% purity, a few weeks away from 90% purity for nuclear weapons. And given Iran\u2019s stated intent to destroy Israel, the bombing of these nuclear sites made imminent sense, especially given the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) recent report that Iran was concealing information on its nuclear program, to include weaponization.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

One of those officers was the visiting Director of the Office of Near East and South Asia Analysis, Robert C. Ames.</p><p>In October 1983, the Iranian government was found responsible for the Beirut barracks bombing by the Islamic Jihad Organization, which killed 241 U.S. service members, 58 French soldiers and 6 civilians, injuring 60. </p><p>These two terrorist bombings apparently emboldened Iran into thinking that terrorism can be effective in eroding U.S. resolve. Thus, Iran continued to support their proxies \u2013 Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen, and Shiite groups in Iraq and Syria \u2013 in its war with the U.S. and Israel.</p><p>In June 1996, Iran was behind the bombing of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 airmen and 498 U.S. and international military and civilian members injured. A U.S. court ruled that Iran \u2013 and its proxy Hezbollah Al-Hejaz -- was responsible for the attack, providing the funding, support and direction.</p><p>This was the very overt Iran, confident in perpetrating these bold acts of terrorism.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

The international community saw some of this in 2009, when the government ensured that incumbent Mahmood Ahmadinejad was reelected president, despite opposition leader, Mir -Hossein Mousavi, having widespread support from the public, promising hope and change. This \u201cGreen Movement\u201d galvanized the Iranian people, resulting in protests, demonstrations and civil disobedience. The regime\u2019s response was predictable: using brutal force to suppress the demonstrations and arrest the protesters.</p><p>This has always been the regime\u2019s response to peaceful protests: suppressing and arresting the protesters. We saw this in September 2022 when Jina Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian -- died in police custody; arrested by the so-called morality policy for improperly wearing her Hijab headscarf. Eyewitnesses reported that Amini was severely beaten and died because of police brutality. </p><p>The Iranian people were irate with the brutal death of Amini. Protests erupted throughout Iran. Iran Human Rights reported that at least 476 people were killed by security forces. Amnesty International reported that Iranian security forces fired into groups with live ammunition and killed protesters by beating them with batons.</p><p>Amini\u2019s death gave rise to the global movement of: Woman, Life, Liberty.</p><p>The regime is now conducting a war against its own people, with widespread arrests of anyone protesting human rights abuses and corruption of the regime in power. </p><p>We would be remiss if we think the Ayatollah has given up on the use of terrorism to intimidate and deal with critics in opposition to his leadership. We would also be remiss if we think the theocracy will cease pursuing a nuclear weapons capability. The regime wants sanctions relief, and they\u2019re prepared to eschew nuclear weapons to get this relief. Eventually, however, they will pursue their nuclear weapons program. We should be prepared.</p><p><strong><em>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/1/irans-terror-legacy-ayatollahs-regime-still-poses-deadly-threat-us/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Times</a></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</em></strong></p><a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em></em></strong></em></u></a>",

Since we are <em>The Cipher Brief</em>, our favorites include not only thrillers and realistic, fast-paced novels \u2013 but some notable works of non-fiction on matters of national security, intelligence and foreign policy. And there\u2019s a cookbook thrown in for good measure.</p><p>We\u2019ve carefully combed through the books that we\u2019ve recently had reviewed by experts who have lived the spy or spy-related life - and we\u2019ve singled out some titles we think you might enjoy at the beach or wherever you\u2019re taking refuge from the summer heat. (<em>And just a note: if you do click and buy using links, we might make a small commission. At least enough to pay for the paper this was printed on.)</em></p><p>Let\u2019s get cooking, shall we?</p><p><strong>Cookbook / Whiskey Category</strong></p><p>Yep, you read that right. Leading our list of summer reads is one that has taken over the #1 spot in Amazon\u2019s whiskey and alcoholic spirits categories, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ZLkEJ4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Spy Walked Into A Bar: A Practitioner's Guide to Cocktail Tradecraft</a></em> by former senior CIA Officers Rob Dannenberg and Joseph P. Mullin Jr. Think of it as a real-life guide to spies and their favorite cocktails. Based on experiences from their clandestine operations backgrounds, Rob and Joe have collected, curated and perfected the cocktails that were enjoyed while celebrating milestone events during their CIA careers. From the drinks they ordered after successfully recruiting assets, to marking the end of a major operation, this book features real life stories and homegrown photos by the authors themselves. </p><p><strong>Novels</strong></p><p>Appropriate for summer, is a new spy novel from Tess Gerritsen, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3G5J0qp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Summer Guests: A Thriller</a></em>. This is Tess\u2019 second spy book, after her very successful TV series a few years ago called <em>Rizzoli and Isles</em>. Gerritsen <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-real-life-spy-coast\" target=\"_self\">talked</a> with Cipher Brief CEO & Publisher Suzanne Kelly about her journey from the popular TV series to spy author in the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-real-life-spy-coast\" target=\"_self\">Cover Stories podcast</a> \u2013 that was just after her first book, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/40wPPIc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Spy Coast</a> </em>was released. Veteran CIA officers Jay and Anne Gruner <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/martinis-and-murder-in-maine\" target=\"_self\">reviewed her latest book</a> about four retired CIA officers living in Maine. The Gruners tell us it is a \u201cgripping account of a complex set of murders, a possible recent kidnapping, and a secretary who was missing for 50 years.\u201d talking about her previous spy-themed book. </p><p>Former U.S. counterterrorism officer and cybersecurity executive Neal Pollard broke the code on Ken Dekleva\u2019s novel, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4nv3byF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Russian Diplomat\u2019s Wife</a></em>. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/i-spy-a-love-story\" target=\"_self\">In his review</a>, Neal says while the book ostensibly is a spy novel set in Vienna, it\u2019s really a love story between two spies. Author (and frequent Cipher Brief contributor) Dekleva draws on his experience as a psychiatrist working for the State Department in many of the locales central to the book and his understanding of human motivation seems to bring his stories to life. We know because we also interviewed the author for the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-russian-diplomats-wife\" target=\"_self\">Cover Stories Podcast.</a></p><p>Speaking of Dekleva, we tapped his expertise to review several books by other authors this year. One worthy of special mention is <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44HgTqG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Poet\u2019s Game: A Spy in Moscow</a></em> by Paul Vidich. Dekleva <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/paul-vidichs-moscow-get-off-the-x\" target=\"_self\">calls</a> the novel is a terrific read about a former CIA station chief in Moscow, now working as an investor in a private equity market in Moscow. The chief was called back to duty though to exfiltrate a former agent who claims to have explosive kompromat regarding America\u2019s president. Navigating between two perilous worlds, those of Moscow and Washington, the storyline seems to offer proof that the cold war never really ended.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em> </em></p><p>Going back even further in time, Dekleva also reviewed <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3GnrWw2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Assignment in Saigon: A Cold War Thriller</a></em> by former senior CIA officer Bill Rapp. In <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/bill-rapps-vietnam-a-different-kind-of-cold-war\" target=\"_self\">his review</a>, Dekleva says that to truly understand the intelligence war in Vietnam, fiction may offer more to the reader and Rapp\u2019s novel is a most worthy read.</p><p>Spy mastery is the theme of retired senior CIA officer Jim Lawler\u2019s latest novel, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44tlQSC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Traitors Tale: A Novel of Treachery within the CIA</a></em>. We turned to another seasoned Agency officer, and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/joseph-w-augustyn\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief expert</a>, Joe Augustyn, to <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/from-spy-master-to-story-teller\" target=\"_self\">review it</a>. Augustyn told us: \u201cJim Lawler has written an intriguing and captivating novel that should satisfy the appetite of any spy novel enthusiast. His character descriptions are impressive, his knowledge of the Agency, its bureaucracy and its inner workings is deep, and his operational savvy is on display throughout. Impressive too is his understanding of the dynamics of personal relationships, both professional and personal, which he calls the \u201cmetaphysics\u201d of spying.\u201d You can learn more about Lawler and his book from this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhEpYXdinnE&amp;t=5s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cover Stories Podcast interview</a>.</p><p><strong>Non- Fiction</strong></p><p>While we have reported on a ton of fine fiction over the past six months, real life stories, history and analysis have played an even larger role in our coverage. Among the books we\u2019d like to invite (or re-invite) to your attention here are: <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4ev0Qzu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Secret Servants of the Crown: The Forgotten Women of British Intelligence</a></em> by Claire Hubbard-Hall and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/neither-swallows-nor-amazons\" target=\"_self\">reviewed</a> for us by Cipher Brief expert <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/tim-willasey-wilsey\" target=\"_self\">Tim Willasey-Wilsey</a>, a real-life former member of the British Foreign Office. Willasey-Wilsey called it a \u201cmarvelous book and a valuable addition to what is known about the early days of the British secret services.\u201d We were lucky to have the author join us on a <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/secret-servants-of-the-crown\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief Cover Stories podcast</a> as well, describing the untold tales of women who silently served \u2013 including Katleen Pettigrew who was the inspiration for Ian Fleming\u2019s \u201cMiss Moneypenny\u201d in the James Bond novels.</p><p>For an American take on unsung women in intelligence, there is <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44sFiiG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Propaganda Girls: The Secret War of the Women of the OSS</a></em> by Lisa Rogak. The former director of the CIA\u2019s Office of Public Affairs, Tammy Kupperman Thorp <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/propaganda-girls-world-war-ii\" target=\"_self\">reviewed</a> the book that focuses on four women who played significant roles in the Office of Strategic Service (OSS) influence campaigns during World War II. She writes that women members of the OSS were in charge of \u201cblack propaganda\u201d primarily a \u201cseries of believable lies designed to cause the enemy soldiers to lose heart and ultimately surrender.\u201d </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

For a fascinating look at that life, check out <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/400hOzY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Story of a CIA Wife: Married to the Craft</a></em> by Rosie Mowatt-Larssen. Veteran journalist and contributing Cipher Brief editor Elaine Shannon <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/a-cia-wifes-tale-of-slipping-kgb-tails-and-other-stories-from-the-cold\" target=\"_self\">reviewed that one</a> for us and lauds the author\u2019s \u201crazor wit\u201d and tales of life in numerous overseas posts including time in Moscow where she helped slip KGB tails, serviced dead drops and lived a life that at times was the stuff of spy thrillers. For more on Rosie \u2013 check out her interview with us for the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/story-of-a-cia-wife\" target=\"_self\">Cover Stories podcast</a>.</p><p>We also have several books about action in World War II that we\u2019d recommend. Let\u2019s start with <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4evexOX\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nothing But Courage: The 82nd Airborne\u2019s Daring D-Day Mission and Their Heroic Charge Across the La Fi\u00e8re Bridge</a></em> by James Donovan. We went to a subject matter expert <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/normandy-la-fiere\" target=\"_self\">to review</a> that one \u2013 retired Army Major General Jack Leide. The book tells of one of the most operationally important but lesser-known stories of World War II. Leide praised the author for providing \u201cincredibly insightful and intricate descriptions and actions of, not only the allied and German military forces arrayed against each other, but how the operation affected many of the local French residents and resistance forces as well.\u201d</p><p>For a far less heroic view of some of the events in that war, there is <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4la0aCs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Traitor of Arnhem: The Untold Story of WWII\u2019s Greatest Betrayal and the Moment that Changed History Forever</a></em> by Robert Verkaik. Recently declassified British MI-5 documents help animate this story of a strategic failure that delayed Allied victory in the war and came at a steep human cost. CIA veteran (and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/martin-petersen\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief expert</a>) Martin Peterson <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/martin-petersen\" target=\"_self\">reviewed the book</a> for us and writes that the author makes a strong circumstantial case that Anthony Blunt, one of Russia\u2019s British agents, played a vital role in passing intelligence to the Germans that damaged the Allies chances of success.</p><p>For a story about operational and intelligence success, there\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44Hi1uq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Taking Midway: Naval Warfare, Secret Codes and the Battle that Turned the Tide of World War II</a></em> by Martin Dugard. Had the Battle of Midway turned out differently, Hawaii and the west coast of the United States stood vulnerable to Japanese attack. The battle was won by the U.S. though through a combination of steely leadership by Admiral Chester Nimitz, and brilliant cryptological work led by a quirky Lieutenant Commander named Joe Rochefort. Normally, our go-to source for book reviewers are gray-haired subject matter experts. For this one, we tried something different and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/taking-a-look-at-the-battle-of-midway\" target=\"_self\">gave the mission to Jack Montgomery</a>, a U.S. Navy ensign currently serving on a Japan-based ship. Montgomery, whose master\u2019s degree thesis was on the Solomon Islands Campaign, notes that the author\u2019s writing style with short punchy sentences makes the book a quick, enjoyable and informative read. Dugard joined us for a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rJ9shOAFZCA?si=_IxSVx-Q3azttufC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cover Stories podcast</a> recently in which he explained how he developed his story-telling style and researched the book.</p><p>Another book sure to fascinate many Cipher Brief readers is <em><a href=\"file://The%20Determined%20Spy/%20The%20Turbulent%20Life%20and%20Times%20of%20CIA%20Pioneer%20Frank%20Wisner\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Determined Spy: The Turbulent Life and Times of CIA Pioneer Frank Wisner</a></em> by veteran journalist Doug Waller. Wisner\u2019s story sounds like fiction. Standout track star in college, lawyer, innovative leader in the OSS during World War II, one of the founders of the CIA, author of successful and unsuccessful covert actions, prominent player in the Georgetown social set \u2013 but victim of what would now be called bipolar disorder \u2013 an illness that eventually led to his taking of his own life. Former senior CIA officer (and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/michael-sulick\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief expert</a>) Mike Sulick <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/covert-action-mental-health-and-a-cold-war-legend-the-story-of-frank-wisner\" target=\"_self\">reviewed</a> the book for us noting that the bio was long overdue and \u201can invaluable contribution to understanding the rewards and pitfalls of covert action as a tool of American foreign policy.\u201d Waller joined us in a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Bb4J847fJi8?si=k1-5aJaPYKDsHrEP\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cover Stories podcast</a> to share some of the secrets of writing about this trailblazing figure of U.S. intelligence.</p><p>A trailblazer of a different kind was Major General Jack Leide whose book, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3IapKsg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Professional Courage: My Journey in Military Intelligence Through Peace, Crisis and War</a></em>, was featured in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/telling-it-like-it-is\" target=\"_self\">a January review</a>. Leide has been inducted into four different military halls of fame. The stories he tells \u2013 and the lessons learned in Vietnam, in China during Tiananmen Square, and as Central Command Director of Intelligence during Desert Shield and Desert Storm make it a valuable read.

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION</strong> \u2013 On January 27, 2025, President Trump signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/the-iron-dome-for-america/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Executive Order</a> aimed at defending the U.S. against an attack by ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles as well as other advanced aerial attacks; the Golden Dome initiative. The Pentagon moved out smartly to fulfill this order. Industry lined up with ideas on how to defend the U.S. and Department of Defense bureaucrats convened and developed a strategy. All the work that has happened is needed. But we need more.</p><p>We need to build the technology to support defensive systems to secure the homeland from adversary advanced aerial attacks. But we are missing a crucial part of the equation which could be happening now with only limited additional resources.</p><p>The U.S. needs to be moving out diligently to put in place the best collection capability to provide early warning regarding U.S. adversaries. Too often, the U.S. jumps to a solution and forgets that we must start with intelligence to put the building blocks in place to address the solution.</p><p>In this case, the Executive Order asks for a study of adversary threat but that is all. There is nothing about developing intelligence for early warning on adversary intent. This is an important oversight. The U.S. must focus on developing warning that lets decisionmakers know when our adversaries are planning a launch. The important satellite tracking mechanisms that will follow the launches should only be used if the intelligence community misses the early warning.</p><p>To ensure the U.S. is using its resources to its best ability in building the Golden Dome, the entire intelligence infrastructure of collection, technology to support the collection, and ability to exploit the collection - to include analytical experts - must be synergized to provide early warning that an adversary is considering an aerial attack.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It\u2019s never been more important to understand what\u2019s happening in the world. Upgrade your access to exclusive content by <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\">becoming a subscriber</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>The literature regarding golden dome focuses on interception and tracking missiles once they are launched. There is a lot of discussion about the need for a defensive system. All of this is warranted, and it is the area where the most money needs to be spent. However, the literature is much less focused on what the U.S. needs to put in place prior to launch to buy time for developing options to counter an attack and limit the risk regarding that decision making process.</p><p>Without the platforms that can collect on adversary intent, capability, movement, and other anomalies, decisionmakers could be left with rushed choices on the use of defensive systems that could result in catastrophic consequences if the technology detects missiles too late or misreads that aerial attacks are coming our way when they may not be.</p><p>Time is the important variable for decision makers. The earlier the intelligence community can present them with analysis and reporting of adversary intent, the better and likely less risky the consequences are for the US.</p><p>For example, if the Intelligence Community (IC) can provide the President with information that an adversary has given an order to prepare an aerial attack against the U.S. - while the attack is being planned but prior to launch - then there are more options to stop that attack.</p><p>The IC is then alerted to track adversary movements so that decisionmakers know how much time they have to decide on an option and which option will work best under the circumstances. In this scenario, U.S. decision makers have days instead of hours, to plan. This allows for a wide range of options to stop a launch - from diplomacy, to sanctions, to military action.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>The current Golden Dome literature talks a lot about tracking these aerial devices and calls for a new look at radars, both space and ground based. As I stated, a reliance on this architecture risks being too late in the decision cycle. Kudos to the Army for recognizing the need for <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/land/2025/03/28/army-looks-to-artificial-intelligence-to-enhance-future-golden-dome/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">smart warning</a> by integrating artificial intelligence into their Integrated Battle Command system, but even this initiative does not hit the early warning collection issue head on.</p><p>LTG Gainey, commanding general of the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) hinted at the issue during a House Armed Services <a href=\"https://armedservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ltg_gainey.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">subcommittee hearing</a> in April when he said the Golden Dome also includes left-of-launch operations, providing deny, delay, disrupt and degrade missile defeat effects in coordination with global combatant commands, the Intelligence Community, Joint Staff, interagency, and Office of the Secretary of Defense. This still does not highlight the need for early warning.</p><p>The U.S. can detect missile launches with its existing Space-Based Infrared System satellites in geosynchronous orbit. These satellites can tell where a ballistic missile is going and where its warheads are likely to fall, but the United States wants to develop better warning and tracking by creating a Custody Layer \u2014 satellites that will watch where all the other guy\u2019s stuff is \u2014 and a Tracking Layer that could also determine where more sophisticated weapons, like hypersonic missiles, are headed.</p><p>Fred Kennedy, the inaugural director of the U.S. Space Development Agency and a former director of DARPA\u2019s Tactical Technology Office, shares in <em><a href=\"https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/golden-dome-analysis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Aerospace America</a></em>, his vision of a Custody Layer: \"a constellation that would be equipped with moving target indicator radar, imaging radar and other sensors, to keep tabs on an adversary\u2019s offensive 'internet of things.' \u2026..These satellites would be the equivalent of Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System and U-2 aircraft, but in space. To strike a missile, you have to know where it could be launched from, after all. Complementing the Custody Layer was the Tracking Layer, the satellites that would detect and track hypersonic or ballistic weapons after launch.\"</p><p>This is all important work and needed but note, it is all focused on launch.</p><p>If decisionmakers are being told by the space-based interceptors that attacks are on the way\u2014there is only one option, to intercept. But what if those interceptors misread the information or what if they did not read the tracking in time? In either scenario it could be the beginning of a catastrophic event that is based on a mistake.</p><p>For that reason, we need to start with the intelligence and put as much effort into that as we are on the interceptors. Collaboration with the Pentagon and other agencies that track satellite imagery is key. I would also add that the Defense Intelligence Agency needs to play a primary role in this initiative which must include increased human intelligence and all forms of open source to include commercial data.</p><p>With the intelligence community and department of defense getting smaller, we need to work together more than ever. Defending our nation is a team sport that requires strong intelligence to set up decision makers and operators to make the best decisions possible, helping to mitigate risk. This cannot happen without the defense and intelligence communities working together to provide the first warning\u2014way before launch. Now is the time to push the intelligence community to upgrade technologies that track missiles by providing warning of aberrations in patterns before launch.</p><p>By using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to synthesize critical technical collection with anomalies in open source (OSINT), commercial (CAI), and personal (PAI) data, we could have the cultural breakthrough we need to change how the intelligence community uses technical collection fused with OSINT, CAI, PAI and AI. Against this national security backdrop, we could have our first big win in changing how we process intelligence and safeguard the US. NGA\u2019s Maven program is a big step in the right direction of fusing intelligence to support DoD and the rest of the national security establishment. This practice needs to be more widespread.</p><p>Now is the time to use proven technology with expert analysis to provide decision makers increased time and space to counter aerial attacks on the homeland. The resources involved, compared to the amount needed for satellites and lasers to shoot down the missiles, is minimal. This action can be started now, the technology exists. Putting in place early warning buys time for the US to develop the rest of the Golden Dome security.</p><p><em><strong>Who\u2019s Reading this?

I was struck by how effusive, really, President Trump was in his praise of what happened at The Hague and very clear in his commitments. What's your take on how that all played out?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>I think I\u2019m more relieved than surprised. I'm biased because I\u2019ve been a NATO officer my whole Army life, as all Army officers are part of the Alliance. I recognize its importance for America's strategic interests. I'm glad that the president did what he did. There was a huge sigh of relief in the Hague that he even showed up. There was some anxiety about that, or that he might blow it up somehow. So the best outcome did happen. He was there. He stayed for the entire thing. He met with President Zelensky. We got an agreement on 5% across the alliance, with one exception, and then a public affirmation of American commitment to the alliance by the president. That's pretty good.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>You\u2019re referring to Article 5 of the NATO charter, which says an attack on any member must be met by all other members. There\u2019s been a kind of rallying cry among some Trump supporters that the idea that American soldiers would fight for Estonia, for example, that\u2019s never gonna happen \u2014 that's not America first. Talk a bit about the significance of that specific commitment, because it seems to put to rest what's been said before on that front.</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which created NATO, says an armed attack on one shall be considered an armed attack on all. That commitment to collective security has been the glue that held the alliance together. The Soviet Union for decades, now Russia and other adversaries, see this commitment of now 32 nations that if one is attacked, all the other nations would consider it an armed attack on themselves. That was such a powerful part of the deterrence when it's backed up by real credible capabilities. </p><p>For the first time in my life, in his last administration, the president called that into question. I was horrified. That sort of opens a door to a terrible miscalculation by Moscow that maybe the U.S. would not be so committed. Then the Russians could achieve what has always been their dream, which is to break the alliance, to see that members would not respond, and also to continue driving a wedge between Europe and North America. So it was important that the president affirmed it very strongly, clearly and publicly. </p><p>Now, some people ask why would we have American soldiers dying for Estonia? It's an absolutely ridiculous assertion because that is people not understanding why the alliance is so important for us. By the way, this Article 5 has only been invoked once in the almost 80 years of history of NATO, and that was after 9/11, when you had Estonians who came and died because of the United States. </p><p>Our economic interests are tied to a very prosperous Europe, so we need Europe to be stable and secure and prosperous because it affects our economy. Secondly, the access that we have in Europe from the UK all the way to Turkey and everywhere in between enables us to project power, not only in Europe, but also into the Middle East and down into Africa.</p><p>And of course, even the United States does not have enough capability to do everything that needs to be done to protect all of our interests around the world. We need allies, and all of our best and most reliable allies come from Europe, as well as Canada and Australia.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there.

Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>NATO, the most successful and longest alliance in the history of the world, has 32 nations now. There are going to be huge disputes between nations all the time. France kicked NATO out back during the time of de Gaulle. They left the military structure of NATO for several decades, but came back. The U.S. had huge debates with the UK and France after the Suez crisis. Turkey and Greece have been almost at war throughout. So, there are always challenges inside any sort of a coalition or alliance for all kinds of obvious reasons. </p><p>The thing that kept us together was always American leadership and the commitment of several nations to say, look, this is too important for us to lose this collective security because of some argument over an economic thing or past grievance. And there's a reason that there are nations still in a queue wanting to join NATO, because they know that their security is so much better if they're part of this alliance.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>The core takeaway seems to be this pledge that all the members except for Spain have made to spend 5% of their GDP on military or military-related stuff. How big a deal is this?</em></em></p><p> <em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges:</em></strong></em> It's an expectation. It's a commitment that everybody achieves this 5% threshold for investment in defense: 3.5% for traditional, what we would consider defense investments, equipment, training, ammunition, personnel; and then 1.5% for infrastructure, rail, ports, cyber protection, all the things necessary to be able to move alliance capabilities around. </p><p>Obviously these things will be exploited in some countries. That would not shock me. But the key was that nations are going to invest in infrastructure, which is badly needed, and the cyber protection of this transportation infrastructure. But also, 3.5 % of GDP, that's almost double for every country from what it was 10 years ago. The United States is not even at 3.5 right now, by the way. So this is going to be a real increase. </p><p>Having said all that\u2014and I do believe in the importance of a metric like that\u2014the most important thing, of course, is capability. Do we have the actual capability to do what we're supposed to do? That\u2019s what will deter the Russians, not a sign on the board that says, hey, we're 3.5. It\u2019s real capability: units that are properly trained, fully manned and have lots of ammunition, aircraft that fly, ships that sail. That's got to be the focus. So I'm glad we got this done, but now we've got to make sure that we turn that money into real capability.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>Do you mean how they spend it? </em></em> </p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>That is a part of it. Where does it go? Germany has a lot of money out there, but the processes are still several years behind. So they've got to fix things internally to take all these euros and turn them into combat formations and capability. They've got the right leadership now to do that in Chancellor Merz.</p><p>But also, I think it's important that we emphasize the importance of readiness to be able to fight tonight. This is a mindset thing. It's not just about buying new planes and equipment and hundreds of thousands of drones. Are you ready to actually deploy on very short notice and fight tonight? Can you get there and do you have what you need? To me, that has got to be job one for every secretary of defense, ministers of defense\u2014 readiness.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>On that \u201cfight tonight\u201d point, it is worth noting that these pledges are to be met by 2035. That's 10 years from now. And obviously, some of the stuff we're talking about takes a long time to manufacture and get out to the battlefield. How concerned are you about that time frame?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges:</em></strong></em> It took us 10 years to get where we are now from Wales. A lot of nations are now spending more than they have since the end of the Cold War. So, of course, I don't like it. We should already be there, including the United States. But I think what we'll see is different leaders, including the American president, continue to track every year. You can't do what they call a hockey stick, where you stay where you are for eight years and then expect that you'll get credit for jacking it up at the end. So there's going to be continued pressure.</p><p>But honestly I don't think too many nations are going to need that pressure. What we're seeing in Germany and in the UK, Finland all the way down to Romania. They're not confused about who the enemy is \u2014 it's Russia. These countries were already moving well beyond 3.5% before this summit. So, I think we're on the right arc and right direction in most places, just not all.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

It suddenly seemed a little bit on the back burner. What are your thoughts on how Ukraine comes out of this summit?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>This is my biggest disappointment from this summit. Ukraine was exactly, what you said, put on a back burner. I'm glad that President Zelensky showed up, that he was invited and that he attended. I'm glad that President Trump met with President Zelensky for about 45 minutes or so. While the president did not reveal a lot of the details, he was more positive about Ukraine than I'd heard from him in quite some time. </p><p>Now, to be candid, the president changes his mind all the time but I hope that this signals that he is more willing and open to helping Ukraine as most of our European allies are. I had hoped that this summit would be another affirmation by the Alliance that we're going to do everything we can to help Ukraine. The organizers shortened it in hopes of making sure that President Trump would stay for the whole thing. And so Ukraine was kind of taken out of the agenda. </p><p>Nonetheless, what's most important is that there seems to have been a positive meeting there. And most of our European allies are even more committed to helping Ukraine defeat Russia.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>You've made the point that Russia is incredibly weakened militarily right now with casualties, the economy, and so forth. And it doesn't seem, in that sense, to be much of a threat. Of course, everything we're talking about and what they were talking about at the summit is all about the Russia threat. So how should we understand the nature of that threat given how weak the country is today?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>This is a great question. Russia, I was certain, would not have made it this long. Given the casualties that they have suffered, the effects of some sanctions on them, and now it looks like they've probably lost Iran as an ally or a source of drones. But China has picked up some of the slack. North Korea continues to provide ammunition. And Russia right now has transitioned to a wartime economy because of course they don't have to worry too much about whether or not the peasants are unhappy that they can't get a new refrigerator. Putin does not have to respond to this sort of thing the way any other democratic leader would have to respond. So he's putting a lot of resources into this. </p><p>That would be over if we could figure out how to stop Russia from exporting oil to China and India. But as long as they can keep doing that, and as long as oil prices stay up, then Russia can keep doing what they're doing for quite some time. At the recent economic forum that Russia hosts each year, President Putin sort of downplayed the economic situation challenges they have. But his own people publicly were saying that they're almost in recession, that they are in fact in trouble.</p><p>What I am sure of is that if Ukraine capitulates or fails, or if we turn our back on Ukraine and Russia is able to take a couple of years to rebuild and fix what is broken, they will be knocking on the door of Moldova and probably of Latvia. Their objective is to break the alliance, to show NATO that nations are not really willing to fight against Russia over a piece of Estonia or Latvia. That would be their terrible miscalculation. So to make sure that the Russians never make that terrible miscalculation, we have to get back to where we were in the Cold War days of spending what's necessary, being prepared so that you can have another 40-50 years of no war with Russia.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-math-behind-trump-s-1-trillion-defense-budget",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014</strong> \u201cThe President's FY \u201826 [Fiscal Year 2026] National Defense Budget requests $1.01 trillion, which is a 13 percent increase from FY '25 enacted [as authorized but not yet funded by Congress] levels. This [FY \u201826] includes $848.3 billion for DoD's [Defense Department\u2019s] discretionary budget and $113.3 billion in mandatory funding for DoD via [the FY \u201925] reconciliation [bill now before the Senate] totaling $961.6 billion total for the Department of Defense.\u201d</p><p>That was a Senior DoD Official briefing reporters last Thursday, on newly-released details of the Trump administration\u2019s defense budget request for the fiscal year 2026, which begins October 1, 2025 and ends September 30, 2026.</p><p>In the best of times, the DoD budget process is difficult to understand, but this year it is even more complicated than most. The final defense budget figure depends not only on passage of the FY 2026 Appropriations Bill, but also on the FY 2025 reconciliations bill.</p><p>In addition, there are some interesting differences among the Pentagon, House and Senate on how the money is to be spent.</p><p>Ideally, a President sends his annual budget proposal to Congress early in the year\u2014late January for example. Congress holds authorization hearings followed by appropriation hearings, and the bills get marked up and passed before the next federal government fiscal year begins on October 1.</p><p>But when it comes to defense, for 11 of the past 12 fiscal years, DoD has had to operate under continuing resolutions (CRs) for some months because Congress in those years was unable to pass the necessary defense appropriations bills until after the new fiscal year began.</p><p>From DoD\u2019s point of view, that has caused problems because under CRs spending levels normally remain the same as the previous year. CRs also prohibit new starts, disrupt production schedules and generally interfere with defense planning. The situation becomes even more complicated in years of presidential transition.</p><p>The fiscal 2025 defense budget was originally put together under the Biden administration. Congress, after President Trump was elected, delayed passage of the Biden fiscal 2025 defense spending plan, approving two short-term CRs. Finally, after Trump became president, Congress approved a full year CR in mid-March 2025. That put DoD funding for this current fiscal year at $852 billion, just one percent above what it was in FY 2024.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Trump administration was working with DoD officials on the FY 2026 defense budget, which the Biden administration back in 2024, had projected would be $876.8 billion.</p><p>Then, on April 7, 2025, during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump, after mentioning that he had built up the U.S. military during his first term in office, suddenly said, \u201cWe have great things happening with our military.\u201d</p><p>Trump went on to say something that he had not said publicly before: \u201cWe also essentially approved a budget\u2026you'll like to hear this, of a trillion dollars, $1 trillion and nobody's seen anything like it. We have to build our military and we're very cost conscious, but the military is something that we have to build and we have to be strong because you got a lot of bad forces out there now. So, we're going to be approving a budget and I'm proud to say, actually the biggest one we've ever done for the military.\u201d</p><p>Trump\u2019s statement about $1 trillion for defense in FY 2026 then became the marching order, but how to do it was the question. A month later, the answer appeared publicly in the form of the FY 2025 reconciliation bill.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em></em></p><p>Since the January presidential inauguration, the Trump administration and Republican leadership had been working on this reconciliation bill in order to change much of the Biden FY 2025 budgeting by aligning all spending, taxes, revenue, and the debt limit with a new, agreed-upon FY 2025 Trump budget.</p><p>Among many features of this FY 2025 Trump reconciliation bill was the insertion of a $150 billion lump sum for defense programs, to be paid out of U.S. Treasury funds available through 2029. There had been no congressional hearings\u2014the number just appeared.</p><p>In early May, when Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released its full government fiscal 2026 \u2018skinny\u2019 budget, public mention was first made of the $150 billion defense package in the reconciliation bill -- and that some $113 billion of it was to be earmarked for the Pentagon\u2019s fiscal 2026 budget.</p><p>That meant DoD\u2019s FY 2026 base budget remained near FY 2025\u2019s $852 billion, but you reached Trump\u2019s announced $1 trillion for overall defense spending by adding the $113 billion in the reconciliation bill along with funds for nuclear weapons paid for by the Energy Department.</p><p>Back in May, at the time of that OMB announcement, Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) said, \u201cFor the defense budget, OMB has requested a fifth year straight of Biden administration funding, leaving military spending flat, which is a cut in real terms\u2026I have said for months that reconciliation Defense spending does not replace the need for real growth in the military's base budget.\u201d</p><p>He was joined at that time by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky), the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, who said, \u201cMake no mistake: a one-time influx reconciliation spending is not a substitute for full-year appropriations.\u201d</p><p>On May 22, in a 215-to-214, largely party-line vote, the House passed its version of the FY 2025 reconciliation bill, containing the $150 billion defense package. The reconciliation bill is now up for debate in the Senate. An advantage for the Trump administration in the reconciliation process is that Senate rules allow for a simple majority vote (51 votes) for reconciliation bills, bypassing the usual 60-vote threshold on controversial measures needed to overcome a filibuster.</p><p>Meanwhile, House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees have held hearings on the Trump fiscal 2026 DoD budget request with mixed results.</p><p>On June 12, the House Appropriations Committee passed its version of the FY 2026 DoD funding bill that followed the OMB May proposal, keeping the numbers close to the FY 2025 level and reaching the $1 billion Trump goal by adding the earmarked $113 billion in the pending FY 2025 reconciliation bill.</p><p>However, questions were raised at the June 18 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was one of the witnesses.</p><p>Chairman Wicker said, \u201cWhat we have in front of us is an inadequate budget request with precious little detail and no follow on data about fiscal years 2027, 2028, or 2029. We must assume, and in fact we have heard, that OMB intends to maintain defense spending at $893 billion across the four years of this administration. So even with a one-time $150 billion [fiscal 2025] reconciliation [bill] infusion, this would leave us at 2.65% of GDP by 2029, below 3 percent of GDP and well below the 5 percent of GDP that we really need.\u201d</p><p>Wicker went on, \u201cI understand that if you put reconciliation and the budget request together for this year [FY2026] it exceeds 3 percent, but if we go back to that same baseline for the next three years, after that we'll be under 3 percent. Do you intend to fix that?\u201d</p><p>Hegseth agreed that going below 3 percent would be very dangerous, adding, \u201cSo does the President of the United States which is why this budget increases from FY25 1.3 percent [if you include reconciliation bill\u2019s $113 billion] and puts us at 3.5 percent of GDP on defense.\u201d</p><p>President Trump recently returned from the NATO summit at The Hague where he took credit for the allies adopting a 2035 goal of 3.5 percent for member countries\u2019 core defense spending. It could be embarrassing for the President to find himself below that amount back home.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

At issue was the tradition known as \u201ccongressional intent,\u201d for Congress to designate spending amounts for specific defense items in legislation.</p><p>At the June 18 Armed Services hearing, Wicker asked, \u201cWe will put funds in the reconciliation bill, working with the House and working with the Administration, to get the [President\u2019s] signature on the bill. And we will make clear alongside that the specific congressional intent [on defense items]\u2026Mr. Secretary [Hegseth] do you commit to following congressional intent unequivocally on reconciliation.\u201d</p><p>After Hegseth gave a qualifying answer, Wicker demanded, \u201cDo you commit to following congressional intent unequivocally in reconciliation?\u201d This time, Hegseth answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I mention this because last Wednesday, Chairman Wicker released what he called an \u201cupdated legislative text of the defense reconciliation bill.\u201d It showed his committee had cut down to $1 billion the $3.3 billion it had previously allocated to deployment of military personnel in support of border operations.</p><p>However, the next day, Thursday, at a Pentagon press conference called to discuss the FY 2026 defense budget, details of which had just been made available, a Senior Defense Official made clear the figure DoD had for the reconciliation bill was different. He said, \u201cThe $5 billion we're requesting [from the reconciliation bill] is for border security for our troops to actually be there as well as for detention support.\u201d</p><p>The Defense Official added of the reconciliation funding, \u201cIt's the first time the Department of Defense has received mandatory money like this. It's ten-year money with a lot more flexibility than the average discretionary dollar provides.\u201d Remember, under traditional circumstances, congressional intent language in statutes determines how defense money is to be spent.</p><p>Under the original reconciliation bill, DoD had 90 days after the legislation became law to send the House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees their plans for spending the $150 billion. What was to happen thereafter is not spelled out, but it\u2019s clear the \u201cflexibility\u201d that the Defense Official has seen is not recognized by Sen. Wicker and, I expect, others on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Will today\u2019s complex circumstances be repeated?</p><p>I saw a hint in something the Senior Defense Official said to reporters last Thursday. Asked about the top defense budget figure for FY 2027, he said, \u201cWe have not yet discussed what that will look like for [FY] '27. But unless the president's tone changes, I imagine we'll stick with $1 trillion for national defense spending.\u201d</p><p>After the June 18, Armed Services hearing, Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said, \u201cAs I understand it, OMB is saying we are going to have a flat defense budget for the next four or five years. Are we playing reconciliation every year from now on?\u201d</p><p>The answer is maybe.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

Exact figures remain difficult to verify, as independent assessments vary. But CCTV claims that the missile\u2019s range is <a href=\"https://interestingengineering.com/military/china-nuclear-missile-can-hit-anywhere-in-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">approximately</a> 12,000 kilometers (7,460 miles), putting most of the continental United States and Europe within reach. So, why does this matter?</p><p>While the details of the DF-5B match some already disclosed details, the notion that state television is putting such a public focus on this is \u201cunusual and perhaps speaks to a willingness on China\u2019s part to begin signaling its nuclear growth in a more public manner,\u201d according to Matt Korda, Associate Director at the Federation of American Scientists\u2019 Nuclear Information Project.</p><p>\u201cChina has not traditionally commented on the details of its weapon systems and instead almost always sticks to high-level talking points. Perhaps this portends a shift in the country\u2019s communications strategy,\u201d Korda, who also serves as Associate Senior Researcher for the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction Program, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>.</p><p>While the original DF-5 missile, <a href=\"https://as.com/actualidad/politica/china-da-detalles-del-monstruo-nuclear-heredero-de-la-guerra-fria-con-un-potencial-de-200-veces-hiroshima-n/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">developed</a> during the Cold War, was outfitted with a single warhead, the DF-5B\u2019s multi-warhead capacity\u2014alongside its purported accuracy within 500 meters\u2014 represents a significant leap in China\u2019s second-strike capability and nuclear survivability.</p><p>Andrew Erickson, a professor of strategy at the Naval War College and visiting China-focused scholar at Harvard University, believes that the renewed focus on this issue \u201cis part of a comprehensive effort to attempt to coerce and intimidate its adversaries regarding the military scenarios about which Beijing prioritizes most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeijing\u2019s goal is to show that it can match or exceed its adversaries on each rung of the escalation ladder; and also has the capability to utilize rungs, or combination of rungs, that its adversaries either do not possess or are more hesitant to use,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Andrew Scobell, Distinguished Fellow for China at the United States Institute of Peace, said, \u201cChina\u2019s communist rulers are feeling more insecure than usual, and this disclosure is their way of signaling \u2018don\u2019t mess with Beijing\u2019 to Washington and other capitals.\u201d</p><p> \u201cThe message is: China\u2019s nuclear weaponry and delivery systems are more capable today than ever before with a longer reach and greater accuracy,\u201d he tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>.</p><p><strong>A Rapidly Expanding Arsenal</strong></p><p>China\u2019s nuclear arsenal <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2025/06/chinas-nuclear-arsenal-surges-20-in-one-year-reaching-over-600-warheads-sipri/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">remains</a> smaller than those of Russia or the United States, but it is growing at an unprecedented rate. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reports that China has increased its warhead count by about 100 in the past year, rising from 500 in 2024, to <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2025/06/chinas-nuclear-arsenal-surges-20-in-one-year-reaching-over-600-warheads-sipri/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">over 600</a> by January 2025.</p><p>The SIPRI report notes that China is \u201cexpanding its nuclear arsenal <a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/nuclear-risks-grow-new-arms-race-looms-new-sipri-yearbook-out-now\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">faster than</a> any other nuclear-armed state.\u201d Experts estimate that by 2035, if current trends continue, China could possess as many as 1,500 nuclear warheads\u2014a threefold increase that would still place it behind the United States and Russia, which together hold nearly 90 percent of the global stockpile.</p><p>But Multiple Independently target-able Reentry Vehicles (MIRVs) \u2014allow a single missile to carry several nuclear warheads, each aimed at a different target. This dramatically complicates interception, as the warheads can overwhelm defenses by arriving on separate trajectories, making coordinated response far more difficult and costly.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

Depending on deployment strategies, this could enable China to deploy several ICBMs comparable to those of Russia or the United States by the decade\u2019s end.</p><p><strong>Implications for Deterrence and Stability</strong></p><p>China\u2019s shift comes as the framework for nuclear arms control faces significant strain. With New START, the last remaining treaty limiting Russian and U.S. strategic nuclear arsenals, set to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-warns-outlook-extending-last-nuclear-arms-pact-with-us-does-not-look-2025-02-10/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">expire</a> in early 2026, and no successor agreement in place, the global arms control architecture appears increasingly obsolete.</p><p>Some experts warn that the world is effectively entering an era of unchecked nuclear competition and worry that the <a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/nuclear-risks-grow-new-arms-race-looms-new-sipri-yearbook-out-now#:~:text=China's%20nuclear%20arsenal%20is%20growing,mountainous%20areas%20in%20the%20east\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">growing</a> deployment of artificial intelligence, space-based sensors, and cyber capabilities could erode crisis stability and introduce new pathways to escalation.</p><p>Advanced systems can compress decision-making time and increase the risk of miscalculation or technical error, particularly in multi-theater conflict scenarios involving China and Russia. According to SIPRI, \u201cthe signs are that a new arms race is <a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/nuclear-risks-grow-new-arms-race-looms-new-sipri-yearbook-out-now\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">gearing up</a> that carries much more risk and uncertainty than the last one.\u201d</p><p><strong>Strategic Consequences for the West</strong></p><p>The implications of China\u2019s buildup extend far beyond Asia. Despite Russia and the United States\u2019 decades-long atomic dominance, China\u2019s rapidly expanding nuclear missile arsenal indicates a profound shift in global strategic dynamics.</p><p>For the West, experts emphasize that China\u2019s nuclear buildup is raising the stakes of deterrence and complicates arms control efforts. It also demands an urgent reassessment of defense postures\u2014particularly as Beijing builds a more flexible, survivable, and modernized nuclear triad \u2013 the ability to launch nuclear weapons from land-based missiles, submarine-launched missiles, and strategic bombers. This capability enables Beijing to more credibly challenge Western military presumptions.</p><p>\u201cAdvanced nuclear weapons and delivery systems are the ultimate backstop supporting Beijing\u2019s efforts to impose a Sisyphean sense of futility on its enemies while supporting the ultimate warfighting options should that preferred approach ultimately fail to deliver,\u201d Erickson said.</p><p>Analysts with the Federation of American Scientists have <a href=\"https://fas.org/publication-term/arms-control/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">observed</a> that China\u2019s expanded ICBM infrastructure enables more flexible deployment, blending fixed silos with mobile launchers and dual-use capabilities, which complicate both detection and preemption. And as the U.S. continues to serve as the primary security guarantor for Europe and the Indo-Pacific, it faces the potential challenge of confronting multiple nuclear-capable adversaries simultaneously. For example, if drawn into parallel conflicts\u2014such as a war in Ukraine and a Taiwan Strait crisis\u2014experts worry that its conventional forces could become overstretched, increasing a reliance on nuclear deterrence.</p><p><strong>The Next Phase of the Nuclear Race</strong></p><p>DF-5B represents more than just a technical advancement for Beijing; it is a calculated message to the world. China\u2019s modernization efforts are now a tangible reflection of the leadership\u2019s ambition to move closer to nuclear parity\u2014particularly in capability and survivability\u2014with the United States and Russia.</p><p>With arms control faltering and nuclear parity drawing near, the world is poised for a new era of strategic competition, marked by high stakes, blurred red lines, and faster-moving threats.

Deterring China is already a complex endeavor that is made even more challenging in today\u2019s tense U.S.-China environment.</p><p>Korda believe that engaging China in arms control talks will be challenging, as Beijing would \u201chave to accept some degree of transparency to join a verifiable arms control regime, and it has traditionally preferred to rely on opacity to safeguard its smaller nuclear arsenal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn addition, China is likely concerned that the United States\u2013\u2013particularly through its ever-expanding missile defense architecture, is seeking to erode its state of mutual vulnerability with its nuclear adversaries,\u201d he said.</p><p>According to Korda, China likely perceives time to be on its side as it continues to expand its nuclear arsenal and \u201cwill likely wait to engage in significant talks until it gains the leverage it thinks it needs to become a more equal negotiating partner.\u201d</p><p>Erickson contends that Beijing\u2019s strategic ambiguity remains central to its doctrine: a tactic and a message.</p><p>\u201cChina doesn\u2019t want us to understand their deterrence strategy; that lack of clarity is baked into the ambiguity,\u201d he notes. \u201cFor twenty years of dialogue on these issues, the Chinese government and Chinese experts outside of government did not engage meaningfully.

First among these, is that we need to win the technology race.</p><p>Advanced technology made in United States did more than just put an American on the moon, it also solidified our economic foundation, empowered long-term entrepreneurial American leadership, and protected our national interests. </p><p>Maintaining this technology leadership should continue to be our priority today. Despite the Biden and Trump Administrations trying to limit the sale of U.S. software used to design semiconductors to Chinese groups, the U.S. government simply has not taken enough meaningful action to actually protect America\u2019s leadership position.</p><p>China is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-publish-policy-boost-risc-v-chip-use-nationwide-sources-2025-03-04/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">embracing</a> loopholes and openly flaunting strategic workarounds in our export policy that allows for the continued development of high-quality semiconductor chips with U.S. technology in China, despite our efforts to restrict Chinese access to such tools.</p><p>Along these same lines, Beijing plans to expand the use of open-source chip technology such as RISC V, in order to ween off its reliance on the West and spur the development of advanced chips in China. By leveraging RISC-V, Chinese companies are using open source software derived in the West to design their own processors for AI, cloud computing, and even military applications without violating current U.S. export restrictions.</p><p>And this shift is happening now.</p><p>Chinese tech giants like Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei have invested heavily in RISC-V research and development, looking to exploit this back-door access to western open source technology. Additionally, Chinese government-backed initiatives are pouring billions into this effort, positioning it as a national priority.</p><p>This should not have been a surprise: after all, <a href=\"https://jamestown.org/program/examining-chinas-grand-strategy-for-risc-v/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">experts</a> have been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/opinion-restoring-america/3289231/how-china-tech-threatens-us-cybersecurity/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">warning</a> for years that this day would come, and China<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-publish-policy-boost-risc-v-chip-use-nationwide-sources-2025-03-04/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> reportedly</a> plans to issue policy guidance to boost the use of RISC-V chips.</p><p>This has not gone completely unnoticed, though. <a href=\"https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/press-releases/gallagher-rubio-select-committee-members-urge-sec-raimondo-safeguard-american\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Congress</a> has been looking at this technology and China\u2019s ability to exploit it, and has rightfully raised a red flag, while the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security has been ramping up <a href=\"https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2024/12/us-strengthens-export-controls-on-advanced-computing-items#:~:text=BIS%20amended%20the%20Export%20Administration,Control%20Classification%20Numbers%20(ECCNs).\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">export controls</a> on advanced chip products.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT Q&amp;A \u2014 </strong><em>NATO leaders convened in The Hague this week for a summit aiming to strengthen the alliance's defenses, with the ever encroaching threat of Russia in mind. The meeting was largely a success, with all members (barring Spain) pledging to meet a new 5% GDP defense spending target. It was also a moment for NATO to project unity and recommit to collective defense, following skepticism from the administration of President Donald Trump, who was receptive and praised the alliance \u2014 saying it is not a \"rip-off\" as he has previously said. Ukraine, while a key topic at previous summits in recent years, was notably on the backburner this time around.<br /></em></p><p><em>The Cipher Brief caught up with General Philip Breedlove (Ret.), a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, for a post-summit debrief to see what positives came out of the gathering and where he is looking next, from how NATO members go about expanding defense capabilities to whether the alliance offers more support to Ukraine and pressures Russia. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. You can watch the full discussion at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFz40aEAdyw\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief's YouTube channel</a>.</em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><p><em></em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong><em>Did things end the way you thought they needed to end this week at the Hague?</em></p><p><em>General Breedlove: </em>We had a great summit. Let's give some credit to Secretary General [Mark] Rutte and the members of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) because we needed unity. When the U.S. president arrived, they had come to unity on the 5% spending commitment. And I think that set the stage. Our president was the first president in the history of NATO to get the organization to seriously invest when he pushed hard on the 2%. So, it went very well.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong></em><em>This felt like a summit that was almost tailor-made for the president. It was an easy pop-in, not a lot of debate, not a lot of back and forth. They knew what to expect going into it. Do you think that that helped fuel the outcome?</em></p><p><em><strong>General Breedlove:</strong> </em>Yes. Very few people understand how NATO works. The secretary general is actually very important, but he's not the decider. He works for the NAC, just like the Supreme Allied Commander of Europe (SACEUR) works for the NAC. Secretary General Rutte has managed the process extremely well to get everybody to where he needed them to be. We need to give him some credit for organizing all of the nations to get them to the right place.</p><p>I think their vision was to keep this short, to the point, get to the things that the U.S. president wants to accomplish, get those accomplished, and come out of this with a big unifying statement. And who is that unifying statement for? Of course, it's for all of our nations and our alliance. But the most important recipient of that message is Mr. Putin.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

He tries to peel off individual countries and leaders. Secretary General Rutte pulled the team together, got them on the same playbook, moved out and didn't waste any time. And I think that's exactly how this U.S. president likes to work.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong></em><em>It was clear going into this that Russia is the real threat to NATO. It's still a little bit unclear as to where President Trump is going to come down on Russia when it comes to how much pressure he's going to be willing to apply. We saw a little bit of movement toward the possibility of more support for Ukraine. What do you think the options are there? And if you\u2019re the Russian president, how are you looking at the outcome of this summit in particular?</em></p><p><em>General Breedlove</em><em>: </em>I'm both encouraged and discouraged on this front. I think there are a lot of people who believe we're ready now and we should be going in with the next round of heavy sanctions on Russia, to go after fuels and the shadow fleet. Our U.S. secretary of state, in his statement, said we're not going there now because it might preclude some sort of a ceasefire or peace agreement in Ukraine. So, he's going to hold off. Russia won that round. That's what they want. Keep stalling, keep the Americans thinking there's going to be a deal, and keep attacking Ukraine. So, we've got to move past that. And I think eventually this is going to happen.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

You've got 32 countries, you have 32 ideas, you have 32 threat assessments. But I actually think it went exceptionally well. It went exceptionally well because Secretary General Rutte did a great job corralling the players, with the exception of Spain. But he did a great job with 31, and then he did a terrific job managing President Trump \u2014 and that's no easy feat.</p><p>This was a landmark summit. The Hague 2025 will be remembered for a true commitment to deterring Russia, and if necessary defeating them if they were to invade a NATO state. And the five percent is certainly part of it, but the language, the direction, the focus, the corralling back in of the United States, all that happened at this summit.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Craving more expert insights into national security?

Obviously with Russia being sort of the looming cloud over NATO, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on that.</em></p><p><em><strong><em>RADM Montgomery: </em></strong></em>I fully support Ukraine and I think we should do as much as we can to help them. I recognize, though, that this 5 percent and the discussion of whether Article 5 applies really was about signatory states. There's a deep, deep issue there that we have to be agreed that we're going to defend Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, particularly. I think they're the four most vulnerable states if they're attacked.</p><p>Separate from that is the issue that right now the European country in combat with Russia that was illegally invaded by Russia, Ukraine, has relied heavily on NATO support because most of NATO recognizes that if you don't deter Russia here, their next ambition could be Moldova, but it could be Estonia. It could be Romania or Georgia, or it could be the Suwalki Gap and a land bridge to Kaliningrad.</p><p>So with all that in play, it was critical that Zelensky got a good reception. I think he did. And the fact that the Ukrainian section was shortened from 42 paragraphs to 10 paragraphs, I don't care. In the end it said we support Ukraine. The NATO contact group is working hard to support Ukraine. European countries are giving Ukraine a lot of money.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

There is no European alternative to the Patriot line at Raytheon or to the AMRAAM line in the United States, which is the weapon that goes in their NASAMs air defense system. There's no European alternative to a million rounds a year of 155mm. You're going to need the U.S. to be involved in that. And therefore, it was critical for the president to say that these lines are available to Ukraine. And he did that on two or three different occasions. It wasn't as clean as I'd like it, but he clearly indicated that was his intention.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em>Next steps for NATO. What do you think?</em></p><p><em><strong><em>RADM Montgomery: </em></strong></em>First, glad to see the 5%. I was really glad that they broke it down to 3.5-1.5, mostly because they'd have never gotten a 5% on planes, tanks, and ships. You'd have had more than Spain break away then \u2014 you might've had the UK, France, and Germany. Or they'd put a due date like 2050, something that doesn't really matter. I'm disappointed it slipped to 2035. It should have been 2032 like the Eastern Europeans wanted. Most of the Eastern Europeans, by the way\u2014Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Poland\u2014are passing through 4% already and heading to 5% within the next 12 months. And that's just on aircraft, ships, and tanks kind of stuff.</p><p>What I really loved about this was the 1.5%. This is about getting cyber right and critical infrastructure protection right. It's about building your defense industrial base. But talking about cyber and critical infrastructure, when you say what's next for NATO, at the last summit, they approved a NATO critical infrastructure center. They put it at SACEUR, and that's critical because what we have to do now is take that center as it comes online in the next year, SACEUR\u2019s war plans, and this money and build the infrastructure that's necessary for the United States to flow our forces from the United States, the UK forces from across the channel, the French forces from deep in Europe\u2014those brigades, divisions, and even corps\u2014to be able to flow across Northern Europe from the ports and the airfields in Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Luxembourg, France, and get to the fight. That is not protected right now. That critical infrastructure is not prioritized and protected in a meaningful way. </p><p>So, in my mind, the big NATO takeaway is 1.5 percent, the cyber center, and a SACEUR with a war plan. If we can now build ourselves the ligature to deter Russia and if Russia is foolish enough to attack, defeat Russia in an invasion of an Article Five-defended country.</p><p><em><strong><em>Are you Subscribed to</em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong> </strong></em><u><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> on YouTube?

On that last and arguably most important front, the gathering at The Hague produced surprising results. </p><p>By the end of the summit, President Donald Trump\u2019s famous disdain for NATO had morphed into a gush. \u201cThis was a tremendous summit,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/world/europe/nato-increase-military-spending-trump.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the president said</a> at a news conference, \u201cI enjoyed it very much.\u201d </p><p>Trump spoke in glowing terms about the alliance - \u201cI left here differently,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/25/trump-nato-iran-ukraine/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a> and promised U.S. support for NATO\u2019s Article 5, which compels each member state to respond to an attack against any other, and which he had previously called into question. Trump was also clearly pleased with the summit\u2019s main achievement \u2013 a collective pledge by members to contribute 5% of their GDP to defense, something the U.S. president had wanted for years.</p><p>Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges (Ret.), former Commander of U.S. Army Forces in Europe, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em> that the summit\u2019s \u201cbest outcome\u201d was NATO\u2019s success at bringing Trump back into the fold.</p><p>\u201cThere was a huge sigh of relief in The Hague that he even showed up, Hodges told us. \u201cThere was some anxiety about that, or that he might blow it up somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was there, he stayed for the entire thing. He met with President Zelensky. We got an agreement on 5 % [spending]...and then a public affirmation of American commitment to the alliance by the president. That's pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually think it went exceptionally well,\u201d said Rear Admiral (Ret.) Mark Montgomery, a senior member of the <a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cyber Initiatives Group</a> and director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cIt went exceptionally well because NATO Secretary General [Mark] Rutte did a great job corralling the players\u2026and then he did a terrific job managing President Trump and that's no easy feat.\u201d </p><p>The costs of placating the U.S. president included hitting that 5% figure, which may be difficult for many members to meet, and a relegating of Ukraine\u2019s concerns to the summit\u2019s back burner.</p><p> At The Hague, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was pleased by what <a href=\"https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/4008310-zelensky-on-meeting-with-trump-we-spoke-about-how-to-achieve-ceasefire-real-peace.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he called</a> a \u201clong and meaningful\u201d meeting with President Trump, and Trump himself acknowledged Ukraine\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/as-nato-summit-fawns-over-daddy-trump-ukraine-gets-only-words-of-comfort/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">brave battle\u201d</a> in a way he hasn\u2019t done previously. Still, some in Ukraine noted that beyond verbal support from Trump and Rutte, there was little new NATO support for Kyiv.</p><p>\u201cThe problem for Ukrainians is that we are super tired from so many words,\u201d Oleksiy Goncharenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. He noted that June had been one of the worst months of the war in terms of civilian deaths, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been \u201cemboldened\u201d by a failure of the U.S. to hold Moscow accountable. \u201cWe want to see concrete results,\u201d Goncharenko said. \u201cWe want this war to end as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe NATO allies made some brutal and to some extent also cynical trade-offs,\u201d Liana Fix, a Europe expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThey wanted the summit to be a success for Donald Trump and to be about defense spending to secure their own security in the long term. It was not designed to be about Ukraine.\u201d</p><p><strong>A Trump surprise</strong></p><p>President Trump\u2019s pivot didn\u2019t just help with the atmospherics at The Hague. For the moment at least, it means that a bitter and dangerous NATO-U.S. rift has been mended. </p><p>Trump has mused out loud about ending U.S. financial and military commitments to NATO. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/20/trump-says-the-us-doesnt-have-to-meet-nato-spending-goal-00416154\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a> he saw no reason for the U.S. to meet the very 5% spending target he had pushed for \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think we should,\u201d he said \u2013 and on the eve of the summit he <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-iran-israel-nato-e34385f9b6e2ff5d0cf60f8aaea57a40\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">refused to commit</a> to U.S. support for Article 5. It \u201c<a href=\"https://semafor.com/s/i3H1R9WFxZ?email=tgnagorski@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">depends on your definition</a>,\u201d he said.</p><p>All that seemed like rear-view-mirror material by the time the summit wrapped at The Hague. Rutte\u2019s pre-summit flattering of Trump \u2013 including a leaked <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114738606142462442\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">private message</a> in which he praised the U.S. strikes against Iran and told the president he was \u201cflying into another big success in The Hague\u201d \u2013 seemed to have had the desired effect. Trump praised Rutte and the alliance, took credit for the spending pledges, and sought to put to rest any doubts about Washington\u2019s Article 5 commitments. \u201cI stand with it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d Trump said when asked to clarify his position. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t stand with it, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>That full-throated support allowed for a final <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_236705.htm?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=posts&amp;utm_campaign=250625%2Bmulti%2Bdeclaration\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">summit communiqu\u00e9</a> that included a reaffirmation of the \u201cironclad commitment to collective defense as enshrined in Article 5.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was important that the president affirmed it very strongly, clearly and publicly,\u201d Lt. Gen. Hodges told us. </p><p>\u201cDonald Trump committed to Article 5, but European NATO members paid a high price for that,\u201d Fix said. \u201cThe whole summit was about offering 5% to Donald Trump, flattering him and making sure that he stays in the alliance. Of course, it's also in the interest of European NATO allies to increase their defense spending, but they would have never come up with this 5% target. That was specifically for Donald Trump, and it worked.\u201d</p><p>Rutte also managed to achieve near consensus among the NATO members \u2013 32 of them \u2013 with the exception of Spain \u2013 committed to the 5 % ask; ultimately it was split into 3.5 % for core military elements \u2013 troops, missiles, ammunition \u2013 and another 1.5 percent for \u201cmilitarily adjacent\u201d spending that nations may devote to infrastructure and cybersecurity.</p><p>That drew praise from Rear Adm. Montgomery, who had advocated for the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/nato-s-critical-1-5-percent\" target=\"_self\">additional commitment</a>.</p><p>\u201cWhat I really loved about this was the 1.5 %,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about getting cyber right and critical infrastructure protection right.\u201d</p><p>Beyond the detailed spending targets, experts saw value in the unified message put forth at the summit, given recent transatlantic tensions.</p><p>\u201cThe degree to which the alliance acts in a unified voice, utilizes consensus, agrees on broad positions, that's a win for the alliance and a big defeat for Putin,\u201d Admiral James Stavridis, a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, <a href=\"https://thecipherbrief.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9775ab595d580738d839f9d01&amp;id=abf3e0c36b&amp;e=abcf227f11\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told <em>The Cipher Brief</em></a>. </p><p><strong>The skeptics \u2013 and the hurdles ahead</strong></p><p>For all the post-summit cheering, there was also skepticism about the implementation of the new 5 % commitments. </p><p>While Poland and the Baltic states are <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2025/04/14/sharing-the-burden-how-poland-and-germany-are-shifting-the-dial-on-european-defence-expenditure/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">already spending</a> nearly 5% of their GDP on defense, other NATO members hover close to 2% and will face political and economic challenges in meeting the new targets. Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez <a href=\"http://v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">refused</a> to sign on, saying his country would spend 2.1 percent of its GDP on defense, \u201cno more, no less.\u201d Slovakia and Belgium pledged to meet the target but said it would be difficult to do.</p><p>Experts noted that in the push to placate President Trump, NATO\u2019s European members had <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/nato-leaders-set-back-trump-defence-spending-goal-hague-summit-2025-06-24/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">agreed</a> to more than double their military spending at a time when many are already struggling to balance their budgets. Politically, these governments \u2013 particularly those in Western Europe, where the Russia threat is less palpable \u2013 may have trouble convincing their constituents that military spending should spike at the expense of outlays for social programs. </p><p>\u201cTo what extent will populists in Europe make defense spending a topic?\u201d asked Fix. \u201cDo they come up with claims like, \u2018Why should we spend for defense just to please Donald Trump? We could spend for social welfare and make a deal with Russia.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Then there is the timetable.</p><p>The NATO communique calls for members to meet their 5% target by 2035. Experts and some intelligence agencies have warned that while Russia\u2019s military and economy have been weakened, new Russian threats to Europe may arise within three to five years of an end of the Ukraine war. </p><p>Hodges and Montgomery both said they were disappointed by the long timeline. The Ukrainian president did too. </p><p>\u201cThis is slow,\u201d <a href=\"https://time.com/7297698/nato-2025-summit-trump-iran-ukraine-defense-topics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zelensky said</a> of the NATO timeline. \u201cWe believe starting in 2030, Putin can have significantly greater capabilities. Today, Ukraine is holding him up, he has no time to drill the army.\u201d </p><p>Finally, there is the question of how the money will be spent. As <em>The Cipher Brief </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/can-europe-really-defend-itself\" target=\"_self\">has reported</a>, European defense production has often been slowed or thwarted by continent-wide <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/06/19/this-weeks-nato-summit-will-be-all-about-placating-donald-trump\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">regulations</a>. And while overall defense strategy and standards have been set by NATO commanders, national military budgets and planning are decided by individual nations. Experts stressed the need for NATO\u2019s European members to spend their 5% in a strategic and coordinated fashion.</p><p>\u201cThe most important thing, of course, is capability,\u201d Lt. Gen. Hodges said. \u201cDo we have the actual capability to do what we're supposed to do? Because that's what will deter the Russians, not a sign on the board that says, Hey, we're at 3.5 percent. You know, it's real capability, units that are properly trained, fully manned, that have lots of ammunition, aircraft that fly and ships that sail. That's got to be the focus.\u201d</p><p><strong>Ukraine on the \u201cback burner\u201d</strong></p><p>Russia\u2019s full-scale of invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was the catalyst for a unified NATO front that had eluded the alliance since the end of the Cold War. This week, with the focus on NATO\u2019s overall defense spending, the recent <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts-assess-strikes-response-and-what-comes-next\" target=\"_self\">strikes against Iran</a>, and the wish to please President Trump, support for Ukraine took a back seat.</p><p>The good news for Ukraine came in the 50-minute meeting Trump held with Zelensky on the summit\u2019s sidelines. Trump spoke of the bravery of Ukrainians and said he would consider providing <a href=\"https://thecipherbrief.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9775ab595d580738d839f9d01&amp;id=3b74622b67&amp;e=abcf227f11\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more Patriot missiles to Ukraine</a> to counter Russian air strikes. \"We are going to see if we can make some of them available,\" Trump said. He also did not reject the idea of approving more U.S. military aid to Kyiv. </p><p>But there were no fresh commitments from NATO, only a general pledge of \u201ccontinued support\u201d for Ukraine. The communiqu\u00e9 made no promise of Ukraine\u2019s future membership in the alliance, which was taken as another concession to Trump, who opposes inviting Ukraine to join NATO. And Fix noted that NATO did not publish a Russia strategy at the summit, presumably over a concern that the U.S. would object \u2013 given the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to recognize Russia as the aggressor in the Ukraine war.</p><p>\u201cThis is my biggest disappointment from this summit, that Ukraine was put on a back burner,\u201d Lt. Gen. Hodges said. \u201cI'm glad that President Zelensky showed up, that he was invited and that he attended. I'm glad that President Trump met with President Zelensky\u2026and he was more positive about Ukraine than I'd heard from him in quite some time. But I had hoped that this summit would be another affirmation by the alliance that we're going to do everything we can to help Ukraine.\u201d </p><p>Goncharenko and other members of the Ukrainian parliament were particularly exasperated by the Trump administration\u2019s rationale for not imposing fresh sanctions against Russia. Trump threatened such sanctions following Russia\u2019s recent military strikes and Putin\u2019s intransigence at the negotiating table, but on the eve of the summit, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said sanctions were off the table for now. </p><p>\u201cIf we come in and crush them with more sanctions, we probably lose our ability to talk to them,\u201d Rubio said. </p><p>\u201cI really can't understand it,\u201d Goncharenko said. \u201cSo, in the case of Iran, to make them go to the negotiating table, their nuclear facilities were crushed by American bombing. And it looks like it worked, at least it looks like that for the moment. In the case of Russia, they say, if we crush them, we will lose the possibility to negotiate. I can't understand.\u201d</p><p>Goncharenko argued that the opposite would be a more logical approach. \u201cIf you want to have Russia at the negotiating table with seriousness, you need to crush them first,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don't understand any language except the language of strength.\u201d </p><p>Montgomery was more hopeful \u2013 for Ukraine and for Europe\u2019s overall posture toward Russia. </p><p>\u201cThe Hague 2025 will be remembered as where there was a true commitment to deterring Russia, and if necessary, defeating them if they were to invade a NATO state,\u201d Montgomery told us. \u201cAnd the 5 percent is certainly part of it, but the language, the direction, the focus, the crawling back of the United States, all that happened at this summit.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>This is exclusive Subscriber+Member content. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/north-korea-abudction-nuclear-enrichment",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>In September 2002, North Korea\u2019s supreme leader, Kim Jong-il, admitted to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi that North Korea had abducted thirteen Japanese citizens \u2014 saying that eight were dead and five could visit Japan and return to North Korea. The Japanese public was shocked. Eight dead? At Japan\u2019s request, North Korea returned the remains of two, Megumi Yokota and Kaoru Matsuki to Japan for forensic analysis. The analysis determined the remains did not belong to either person.</p><p>In October 2002, President George W. Bush sent Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia/Pacific Affairs, James Kelly, to Pyongyang for meetings with North Korea\u2019s Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju. During their meeting, Mr. Kang admitted that North Korea had an active gas centrifuge program to enrich uranium for use in nuclear weapons. He rhetorically asked what the U.S. was prepared to do about such a program. The meeting then ended abruptly.</p><p>These are the two issues that continue to poison relations with North Korea. The Mr. Koizumi visit to North Korea was done in the spirit of improving relations; the ideal outcome was North Korea apologizing and returning all the Japanese citizens they abducted and adhering to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and other nuclear commitments, given that in 1998 North Korea launched a long-range Taepo Dong missile that flew over Japan. Mr. Koizumi\u2019s meeting with Mr. Kim was not the success it was meant to be. The Japanese public was irate with the results of the visit.</p><p>To date, the abductee issue continues to be unresolved, with a mandate from the people that there be closure on this sordid chapter of Japan-North Korea relations. Yokota Sakie, the mother of Yokota Megumi, who was a first-year junior high school student when she was abducted in 1977, recently had a press conference imploring the government to bring back the abductees. Ms. Sakie is the only surviving parent of the government-recognized abductees who remain unaccounted for.</p><p>Japan recognizes seventeen citizens abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 80s; five returned to Japan in 2002, but the other twelve are unaccounted for. There are other estimates that there were hundreds of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea during that period.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Are you Subscribed to </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.</em></strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>North Korea\u2019s highly enriched uranium program continues to be the major stumbling block in resolving the nuclear issue with North Korea. When North Korea was confronted in 2002 with intelligence indicating a clandestine uranium enrichment program for nuclear weapons, Mr. Kang did not deny it; rather, he apparently made it clear that there was nothing the U.S. \u2013 and others \u2013 could do about it. It also speaks to North Korea\u2019s long-held determination to be a nuclear weapons state. So, despite the Agreed Framework of 1994 that was meant to end North Korea\u2019s quest for a nuclear weapon, Pyongyang decided to pursue a clandestine program to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.</p><p>Indeed, North Korea is now quite open about this uranium enrichment program. The failure of the 2019 Hanoi Summit was due to Mr. Kim\u2019s unwillingness to include his uranium enrichment sites, in addition to the Yongbyon plutonium site, in a deal to lift sanctions in return for a halt in all nuclear programs. In fact, Mr. Kim recently visited another enrichment site, apparently at Yongbyon, where he was shown pictures of shining centrifuges.</p><p>North Korea continues to produce fissile material \u2013 plutonium and enriched uranium \u2013 for nuclear weapons, while enhancing their ballistic missile capabilities, with a Hwasong-18, a solid fuel Intercontinental missile (ICBM) capable of targeting the whole of the U.S. Most recently, Mr. Kim talked about North Korea\u2019s goal of having a blue water navy, which would give North Korea considerable reach in international waters, an obvious threat to Japan and other neighboring countries. </p><p>North Korea\u2019s enhanced nuclear and missile programs and their mutual defense treaty with Russia, with over 11,000 North Korean troops in Russia for the war with Ukraine \u2013 in addition to ballistic missiles and artillery and rocket launchers \u2013 requires immediate attention.</p><p>On June 26 there will be an online symposium in the United Nations on the abduction issue. I and hopefully many others will tune in to this symposium, given that it\u2019s an \u201congoing problem and an international challenge that requires immediate resolution.\u201d </p><p><em><strong><em>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jun/24/abduction-uranium-enrichment-two-issues-poisoning-us-relations-north/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>The Washington Times</em></strong></em></u></a></p><p><em><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</em></strong></em></p>",

Gen. <a href=\"https://newsroom.consilium.europa.eu/events/20250528-eumc-chairmanship-handover-ceremony\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sean Clancy,</a> head of the European Union\u2019s military committee, recently called a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/business/europe-nato-defense-spending.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cglobal reset.</a>\u201d NATO members have agreed ahead of this week\u2019s summit to boost defense spending to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/23/trumps-5percent-nato-spend-target-very-very-difficult-to-meet-greek-pm.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5% of GDP</a>, a huge jump from a 2% target that many in the alliance had struggled to meet. That change is an acknowledgement of both the growing Russian menace and Trump\u2019s threat to withhold support from NATO nations who miss the 5 % mark. </p><p>Trump has also made clear that the U.S. plans to reduce its financial and troop commitments to NATO, and he has shown disdain for the alliance\u2019s European members. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/20/trump-says-the-us-doesnt-have-to-meet-nato-spending-goal-00416154\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump argued that</a> the 5 % NATO target wouldn't apply to the U.S. \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think we should,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think they should.\u201d And as Europe worked a diplomatic channel to bring Iran to the negotiating table, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-giving-iran-window-table-struck-2-days/story?id=123081689\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump said Friday</a> that \"Iran doesn't want to speak to Europe. They want to speak to us. Europe is not going to be able to help in this one.\"</p><p>\u201cEurope is facing a decision point, a crossroads,\u201d Doug Lute, a former U.S. Ambassador to NATO, told The Cipher Brief. \u201cAnd the decision is, will Europe stand up as one of the poles in this new multipolar international system?\u201d</p><p>Another former U.S. Ambassador to NATO, Kurt Volker, said he believes the U.S. commitment to Europe will remain strong, but only if NATO\u2019s European members make good on their new pledges to boost defense spending. </p><p>\u201cWhat I see is a tremendous U.S. push to strengthen NATO,\u201d Amb. Volker said. \u201cThe U.S. has responsibilities globally and especially in Asia and wants to be able to dedicate more resources there. But it can only dedicate more resources and attention if Europe steps up to do more of its own role in securing Europe and in preparing for the defense of Europe, which they are doing.\u201d</p><p>The question, then, for Europe, as the NATO leaders meet: When it comes to defense and security, can Europe go it alone? Or, as Amb. Lute put it, \u201cCan [Europe] assemble the hard power it needs in a rapid, emergency basis under the pressure of time? Can it assemble the hard power required to stand by itself?\u201d </p><p><strong>What Europe is saying \u2013 and doing</strong> </p><p>Recent European pledges and military budgets would suggest that at a minimum, the European \u201creset\u201d is underway \u2013 and that the continent is taking significant first steps to bolster its own defenses. </p><p>To win consensus on the new 5 % spending target, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte split the commitments into 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for \u201cdefense-related\u201d items including infrastructure and cybersecurity.</p><p>5 % may seem a small figure, but it represents a quantum leap for the alliance. Today only 23 of the <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49198.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">alliance\u2019s 32 members</a> have met the previous 2% target. (<a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49198.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NATO estimates</a> that the U.S. spent around <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2024/6/pdf/240617-def-exp-2024-en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3.4% of its GDP</a> on defense in 2024.) The percentages of defense spending were higher during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union posed a clear and regular threat to Western Europe from its side of the Iron Curtain. The numbers dropped precipitously after the Soviet state met its demise in 1991.</p><p>\u201cAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, everybody cashed in and defense spending in Europe fell,\u201d Amb. Volker said. Today, he added, \u201ceveryone recognizes that Europe has taken too much of a peace dividend and they're not prepared. So that's why they're willing to agree to this 5 % target now.\u201d</p><p>NATO has <a href=\"https://semafor.com/s/XicqOC7FOq?email=tgnagorski@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">also pledged</a> to boost its <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-03/nato-is-pushing-for-fivefold-boost-to-ground-based-air-defenses\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">surface-to-air defense</a> capabilities, an area in which the alliance has depended heavily on the U.S. And in March, the European Union took steps of its own to boost military spending, creating a <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/05/27/safe-council-adopts-150-billion-boost-for-joint-procurement-on-european-security-and-defence/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">150 billion Euro ($170 billion) </a><a href=\"https://behorizon.org/european-defence-readiness-2030-a-new-blueprint-for-strategic-autonomy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\u201ccombat readiness\u201d</a> fund for weapons procurement. </p><p>Meanwhile, that 1.5 % allotment for infrastructure and cybersecurity is an \u201cunderappreciated component\u201d of the European commitment, according to Rear Admiral (Ret.) Mark Montgomery, a senior director at the <a href=\"https://www.fdd.org/projects/center-on-cyber-and-technology-innovation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation</a> (CCTI) at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

Philip Breedlove told <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cROAM6U0Wm0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief.</a></em> He said that a recent tour of eight European countries had convinced him of a broad commitment to spending for \u201clong-term readiness\u201d on defense. </p><p>\u201cMost capitals have determined [that] Mr. Putin is not a partner, he's an enemy,\u201d Gen. Breedlove said. \u201cHe has now three times amassed an army and marched across internationally recognized borders and invaded his neighbors, and we're going to have to deal with him.\u201d </p><p>Beyond the alliance-wide hikes in defense spending, several European countries have made dramatic moves to bolster their own militaries. Earlier this month the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/uk-expand-submarine-fleet-defence-review-calls-warfighting-readiness-2025-06-01/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">British Defense Ministry</a> announced an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-strategic-defence-review-2025-making-britain-safer-secure-at-home-strong-abroad\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">overhaul</a> of its procurement approach, shifting from a focus on heavy armor to smaller, high-tech weaponry. Germany\u2019s chancellor Friedrich Merz <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/friedrich-merz-germany-bundestag-europe-conventional-army/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">has promised</a> to build \u201cthe strongest conventional <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/can-germany-build-europe-strongest-military-ukraine-russia-army-2025-5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">army in Europe</a>,\u201d and earlier this year Germany made its first permanent foreign deployment since World War II, stationing a 5,000-strong brigade in Lithuania. </p><p>\u201cGermany's economy has awakened to this new military-industrial demand signal, especially under new Chancellor Merz,\u201d Amb. Lute said. \u201cThere are step-by-step indicators that Europe has changed its perception of the threat, the direct threat to Europe, but also this change in the transatlantic relationship.\u201d </p><p>For all the pledges, problems abound. Experts warn that a morass of national and continent-wide <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/06/19/this-weeks-nato-summit-will-be-all-about-placating-donald-trump\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">regulations</a> may thwart or delay efforts to build a potent European defense force. Overall strategy and standards have traditionally been set by NATO commanders, but national military budgets, planning and purchasing are the purview of individual nations. And Amb. Lute warned that European political swings may also hamper efforts to jump-start military production. </p><p>\u201cThe government [in Germany] can't simply demand that Rheinmetall, for example, begin to produce where it hasn't produced in the last 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cYou actually have to enter into the capital marketplace. And that counts on a significant and reliable year-after-year demand signal, which has not been the case over the last three decades.\u201d</p><p><strong>Geography matters</strong> </p><p>The most concrete signs of a continent on a war footing can be found along the eastern edges of NATO, in places where proximity to Russia has driven defense policy. While Spain, which sits in southwest Europe, far from any Russian border, spent only 1.3 % on defense last year, <a href=\"http://v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Poland</a> \u2013 which shares a long border with Ukraine as well as a powerful enmity towards Moscow \u2013 has nearly reached the 5 % threshold already. Meanwhile, NATO\u2019s two biggest military spenders per capita are the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2025/04/estonia-approves-3-2b-defense-spending-spike-locks-in-5-4-percent-gdp-target/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Baltic nations</a> of Estonia and Lithuania; Latvia is close behind. </p><p>\u201cThe most fundamental observation here is that geography still counts,\u201d Amb. Lute said. \u201cSo the closer you are with a land border to Russia and now a newly aggressive, revanchist, neo-imperialist Putin's Russia, the more these hard defensive measures count.\u201d</p><p>Such measures reach beyond military spending.

And Poland has gone so far as to <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/why-polands-president-wants-us-nuclear-weapons/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">request</a> that NATO nuclear weapons be stationed on its soil. </p><p>\u201cDoesn't surprise me at all,\u201d Gen. Breedlove said of the landmine decision and Poland\u2019s remarks about nuclear weapons. </p><p>\u201cRemember, these nations now are really trying to decide, is America a reliable ally or not?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they're going to have to go it alone, they're going to have to take some pretty tough measures to make sure that they can hold, should Russia do what they seem to be continuing to do\u2026and they're going to start taking these more drastic measures because you just can't bet your national sovereignty and existence on a hope.\u201d </p><p><strong>The missing pieces in a European defense</strong></p><p>A r<a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/research-paper/2025/05/defending-europe-without--the-united-states-costs-and-consequences/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ecent report</a> from the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimates that it would take Europe 25 years and <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/research-paper/2025/05/defending-europe-without--the-united-states-costs-and-consequences/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">nearly $1 trillion</a> to replace U.S. military support if Washington withdrew from the continent. </p><p>The report found that key gaps for NATO members would involve aircraft, naval forces, and command infrastructure. NATO officials <a href=\"https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/russia-could-strike-nato-within-five-years-warns-chief/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">have also warned</a> that current air defenses may be inadequate to protect against the range of threats that have featured prominently in the Ukraine war \u2013 high-tech drones, missiles, and fighter aircraft. </p><p>The IISS report makes clear \u2013 and many experts agree \u2013 that for all the commitments to boost European defenses, the continent remains heavily reliant on U.S. capabilities. </p><p>\u201cWhere America is absolutely the key is all of the enablers, all of the things that make an army potent \u2013 long-range precise fires, deep technical intelligence, developing kill chains and target folders in order to strike,\u201d Gen. Breedlove said. He said he sees minimal immediate risk to Europe, given a badly weakened Russian military, but that in the longer term, the Europeans will need to manufacture or obtain a long list of high-end hardware on their own. </p><p>\u201cThere are a few things that really only America can do,\u201d Gen. Breedlove said, listing rapid aerial transport, high-performing air defenses such as Patriot missile batteries, and sophisticated intelligence systems. \u201cThey really don't have the kind of strategic lift that America brings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe're not talking about tank brigades or ships at sea and so forth,\u201d Amb. Lute said. \u201cWe're talking about things like a high-end missile and air defense. Think of the Patriot missile system, which really doesn't have a European rival\u2026the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and in particular, space-based ISR capabilities. We're talking about air-to-air refueling and that strategic mobility, which is the combination of air-to-air refueling and large-body transport aircraft. So systems like that, for which Europe has relied on the United States, are going to have to become increasingly European owned and operated.\u201d</p><p>Lute and others say a fundamental problem for Europe will be that even if the will and funding are there, none of these systems can be produced quickly. It may be that in the short term, while manufacturers in Europe reboot, they will need to spend their money on purchases from American defense firms. </p><p>Amb. Volker said he remains optimistic about Europe\u2019s defense future, provided it maintains its current level of resolve. </p><p>Filling the gap \u201cis not rocket science, it's easy to do,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope needs to be strategic about this.\u201d </p><p>Volker said that while those high-end \u201cenablers\u201d should be a long-term aspiration, Europe\u2019s near-term focus should be on more nuts-and-bolts defense capabilities \u2014 troops, armor, artillery, ammunition, aircraft, and so forth.</p><p>Ultimately, he said, while some countries will reach the 5 % spending target more quickly than others, the consensus on the gravity of the threat is a good sign. </p><p>\u201cThe fact that they are agreeing to the target means that there is a recognition that it's needed,\u201d Volker said. \u201cThat means there will also be movement toward that target. It will be an iterative process as to how we get there. But no one in Europe is contesting the notion that we need to get there.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em></em></p><p><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</strong></em></p>",

He is a partner in the KKR global investment firm and chairs the firm\u2019s global institute.\n      </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: The U.S. had the element of surprise in the weekend bombing raid. How important was that?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Gen. Petraeus:</em> </strong>Surprise is always a tremendous advantage if it can be achieved, and it does appear that this was the case here. There certainly was no air defense fire. Certainly, no aircraft from Iran tried to oppose those that were flying through their airspace. And they even hit two of the sites with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. 25 or so of those were used against the first two sites at Isfahan and Natanz, Natanz being the main enrichment site, of course, that was already hit by the Israelis. A very impressive operation, without question. And again, absolutely no opposition from the ground or from the air.</p><p>All of this was done in 25 minutes from entering the airspace to leaving it, having flown all the way from the middle part of the United States, seven apparently B-2 bombers, each carrying two of the massive ordnance penetrators, those 30,000 pound mountain busters, really, bunker buster doesn't quite do it justice, with 5,000 pounds of explosive after they've already burrowed through rock or concrete or what have you.</p><p>There are questions, however, after all of this, and I think we have to be very cognizant of them, the most significant is really how much damage actually was done. And you don't know until the BDA - the bomb damage assessment - process has been concluded and intelligence has determined whether or not the facilities were completely destroyed with all of the centrifuges and with all of the highly enriched uranium that was stockpiled at these different sites. Did some of it get moved in the days before? Did some of the centrifuges as well as the HEU get displaced? Is there a hidden site? There have been rumors about that, as you know, I'm sure.</p><p>And so how much of the nuclear enterprise is left at this point? And here, we would talk just not about the enriched uranium, the highly enriched uranium - the IAEA said they saw some particles that were enriched to as high as 83%, recently noting that 90%-plus is weapons grade - how many centrifuges are left? Are they operational? Could they enrich the HEU, further to weapons grade? And do they have the expertise left to do all of this, noting that I think it's approaching two dozen of the leading nuclear scientists have now been killed by Israel.</p><p>Those are some of the very significant questions that remain to be answered. But without question, this was a very impressive operation carried out by over 125 aircraft, if you count all of the refueling aircraft, you count the F-22 stealth fighters, the F-35 stealth fighter bombers and so forth that escorted them through the airspace, the submarines, the seven B-2 bombers plus jammers, air surveillance, undoubtedly drone surveillance, this was a well-orchestrated effort that shows our men and women in uniform really at their very best.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: Talk to us a little bit about how the bomb damage assessement \u2013 the BDA - works. I'm assuming when they're assessing the damage from this bombing, they're using a lot of overhead images. You served as director of the CIA. I would assume there would be some human intelligence from sources on the ground that would be woven into that. What are the components of the damage assessment? How does it work?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Gen. Petraeus:</strong></em> Every element of intelligence will be employed in this case. Of course, it will include various forms of imagery intelligence. There will be various forms of signals intelligence if they can get it, cyber intelligence; and as you noted, human intelligence. Measurement and Signals, MASINT, is another whole element; even open-source intelligence, if it can be mined and you can find something. There may be people taking photos of this and we\u2019ve seen repeatedly how useful cell phone videos can be in just seeing what took place. So, the bottom line is that every element, every type of intelligence that can be gathered, will be gathered. That\u2019s the science and then the art, of course, is in the fusion of all of this.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: You actually oversaw exercises around this very scenario while you were in Command. I'm wondering if you can talk us through some of the challenges that the U.S. military could have run into as part of this operation. How difficult is an operation like this to actually pull off?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Gen. Petraeus:</strong></em> An operation like this is difficult even without an enemy. 125 aircraft engaged in this - it's a real minuet. Everything is timed out. The fact that it flew from the middle part of the United States all the way across the ocean, across many of the Gulf states and so forth from the Mediterranean to get to Iran and then had to link-up with the F-22s and the F-35s that were presumably already in bases around the region. There are jammers, electronic warfare aircraft. There are aircraft that are performing surveillance tasks, both air surveillance and then others that undoubtedly were looking at the actual targets themselves before and after.</p><p>This was a very complicated operation even without any enemy. We did actually do a rehearsal of a plan to destroy Iran\u2019s entire nuclear program. This operation hit just three sites, of course. The rehearsal was formulated after the September 2009 release of information by the International Atomic Energy Agency that Fordow existed. This was known in intelligence circles prior to that but that was a catalyst for the development of a plan to destroy the entire program, and the means for retaliation and the air and ballistic missile defenses and all the rest of this.</p><p>That was an enormous plan, even bigger than what was carried out over the weekend. We did rehearse that one time in the continental United States. This is all publicly known. And that meant that we flew laps of the U.S. with the B-2 bombers, given how far their route would be if they took off from the U.S., as appears to be the case in this particular situation. And even then, it was very challenging.</p><p><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em>It's fascinating. What can you tell us in terms of what would it take to completely destroy Iran's nuclear program?<em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Gen. Petraeus:</em> </strong>A lot more than this, because there are many other sites. To be very clear about it, all you have to do is look at the various maps of what the Israelis have taken out over the past nine days or so, and you'll see what it was that we were envisioning destroying. Now, some of those are new or more developed than they were back at that time. The air ballistic missile defenses are much more capable or were much more capable until Israel destroyed them than what we faced at that time. So, obviously the situation has evolved, but it was a very substantial operation, and very likely would not have been achievable within a single sortie of aircraft, however large. And there would've been a lot of follow-up operations required to ensure that you got everything. And then also to go after what they could have used to retaliate against energy infrastructure, freedom of navigation in the Gulf, our bases and forces and so forth.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: There are fears that Iran may mine the Strait of Hormuz. Once the military operation is over, you mentioned that there are rumors that there may be a hidden site, and one would assume that the intelligence component to this goes into overdrive now. What can you tell us about what is likely happening on the intelligence side?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Gen. Petraeus:</em> </strong>I'm sure that the intelligence side has been in overdrive for weeks, if not months, as this has all been contemplated. That's their job. And of course, sharing with the Israelis and taking what they are getting, because their sources and methods and years of experience and expertise are really unmatched. But now there is a crucial task. The priority intelligence requirement is to identify whether all of the highly enriched uranium has been destroyed, whether all of the centrifuges have been destroyed, and what other human expertise is still alive that could restart a program or continue what they were doing with whatever is left at this point in time.</p><p>That is a huge, huge question. I'm not sure that at the end of the day that they'll be able to answer that with complete certainty. That has always been a challenge.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: You mentioned these aren't really bunker buster bombs, they're mountain buster bombs. How likely do you think it would be if these bombs were successfully dropped in the right place, which it looks like they were - how would they work?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Gen. Petraeus:</em> </strong>No other country has this 30,000lb bomb. No other country has an aircraft that can carry this size bomb. What you would typically do is launch one and try to see what the effect was, and others are going to follow. The same is true of Natanz. You have to burrow down through the subterranean chambers to get to the very bottom, which is where the so-called mission spaces were at Natanz. The Israelis did do that already, and I suspect that the combination of the submarine-launched ballistic missiles and MOPs used there will have finished that off.</p><p>With respect to Fordow, the bomb will penetrate quite a distance. There's plenty out there in publicly available information that shows how far; it depends though on the particular rock, how dense it is, or concrete or what have you. But eventually it burrows all the way down, and then it literally blows up the 5,000 pounds of explosive that are in the warhead portion of the bomb. And again, if you need to, you just pile drive your way all the way down into the center of that structure.</p><p>We'll see what it is that our various imagery intelligence and other forms of intelligence can tell us about how successful this was. There are concerns about photos online, showing trucks outside Fordow in the days leading up to this attack. It\u2019s hard to say how old they were and what was really was going on with them. But that does inject a bit of uncertainty into whether or not all of the HEU was still there, and whether all of the centrifuges were still there. That's going to be a key question for the intelligence community.</p><p><em><strong>This is exclusive Subscriber+Member content. </strong></em><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in </em><a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\"><em>The Cipher Brief</em></a></strong><em><strong> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</strong></em></p>",

We worked as a team like perhaps no team has ever worked before, and we\u2019ve gone a long way to erasing this horrible threat to Israel. I want to thank the Israeli military for the wonderful job they\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>That was President Trump last Saturday night during his announcement of the U.S. attacks earlier that evening on three of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites.</p><p>It should remind people how important Netanyahu and the Israeli military were in Trump\u2019s off-and-on military and diplomatic decision-making during the weeks leading up to the attack.</p><p>Perhaps one key was Trump\u2019s acceptance of Netanyahu\u2019s claim that Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon, which was done publicly last Tuesday. On Air Force One heading home from the G7 meeting, Trump was asked how close he thought Iran was to getting a bomb and he replied, \u201cVery close.\u201d</p><p>At that time, the U.S. intelligence community had assessed that Iran, although increasing the level of uranium enrichment to over 60 percent \u2013 with 90 percent needed for a bomb \u2013 had not decided to build a bomb.</p><p>When Trump was told that his Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard had two months earlier testified to Congress that Iran had not yet decided to build a bomb, he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t care what she said. I think they were very close to having it.\u201d</p><p>For me that was another Helsinki moment \u2013 taking me back to the July 2018 press conference in Helsinki with Russian President Vladimir Putin, after the two leaders had met together. Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to the allegations of Moscow meddling in the U.S. 2016 elections.</p><p>Trump replied, \"President Putin says it's not Russia.

But, Trump warned, that failure to reach agreement within 60 days once negotiations began could result in serious military consequences for Tehran.</p><p>Those negotiations began on April 12, and after five rounds of talks, on June 9, Iran rejected the Trump administration's proposal for a new nuclear deal which prohibited Iran from domestic uranium enrichment, removed Iran\u2019s current stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, and the set conditions for lifting sanctions on Iran.</p><p>During that April-to-June two-month negotiating period, things were going on secretly. In Israel, its military and intelligence agencies were preparing complex plans for attacking Iran\u2019s top military personnel, offensive missile units, air force and air defenses and radar systems.</p><p>Joint Chief Chairman Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, during a Sunday press conference, talked about the U.S. preparation activities.</p><p>\u201cIn just a matter of weeks, this [bombing Iran nuclear sites] went from strategic planning to global execution,\u201d Caine said. He added, \u201cMore than 125 U.S. aircraft participated in this mission, including seven B2 stealth bombers, multiple flights of fourth and fifth generation fighters, dozens and dozens of air-refueling tankers a guided-missile submarine, and a full array of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft.\u201d</p><p>Another indication that U.S. planning for the Iran attack went on during the nuclear negotiations came from what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said when he appeared with Caine at Sunday\u2019s press conference.</p><p>\u201cIran found out that when POTUS [President of the United States] says 60 days that he seeks peace and negotiation, he means 60 days of peace and negotiation. Otherwise that nuclear program, that nuclear capability, will not exist,\u201d Hegseth said.</p><p>On June 13, one day after the Trump negotiation deadline, Israel attacked Iran with</p><p>fighter-bomber aircraft and armed drones that had been smuggled into Iran. They incapacitated many of its air defenses and offensive missile system and killed top generals and scientists. In a telephone interview with Reuters, Trump said, \u201cWe knew everything [about the Israeli attack], and I tried to save Iran humiliation and death. I tried to save them very hard because I would have loved to have seen a deal worked out.\u201d</p><p>Caine said on Sunday, \u201cIsrael had an incredible military success especially at the beginning and ongoing in degrading Iranian capabilities in degrading Iranian launchers...It's been incredible to watch what our ally Israel has been able to do.\u201d</p><p>He later added, with reference to the U.S. bombing in Iran, \u201cWe took advantage of some of the preparatory work [by the Israelis] that's been done over the past week and a half in terms of axis of approach\u201d to Iran targets. He added, \u201cI won't get into the particulars, but as the secretary [Hegseth] said, it was a U.S. strike. We made sure we were not in the same piece of airspace\u2026That was the extent of it.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Mr. Khamenei may have thought Iran\u2019s 2023 membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in 2023, and the March 2025 joint military exercise with Russia and China may have tempered Israel\u2019s reaction to Iran\u2019s flaunting of Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty obligations. Or perhaps they thought the January 2025 Iran-Russia Strategic Cooperation Agreement would have provided some cover. Or that Iran\u2019s close relationship with China, certainly since the 2021 China-Iran twenty-five-year strategic agreement on energy and geopolitical issues, would have helped them. But this didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>What Iran got were mere statements of support. </p><p>Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, is now in Moscow meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to plead for Russia\u2019s support. Mr. Putin has already said that \u201cThere was no justification for the U.S. bombing of Iran and that Moscow was trying to help the Iranian people.\u201d China\u2019s response to the U.S. bombing was equally predictable, \u201cChina strongly condemns the U.S. attacks on Iran and bombing their nuclear facilities \u2026 calling for an immediate cease fire.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Their relationship with Iran goes back decades, and much of it dealt with providing Iran with ballistic missiles and conventional weaponry for its war with Iraq.

    "title": "Could Iran's Judiciary Chief Be the Next Supreme Leader?",
    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/iran-supreme-leader-succession",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>As Israel's unprecedented military campaign and targeting of Iranian military leaders and scientists wreaked havoc across Iran last week, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei retreated to a bunker and initiated deliberations over his successor. With the 2024 death of a former leading contender, President Ebrahim Raisi, and Khamenei\u2019s recent sidelining of his son, Mojtaba, the powerful head of Iran\u2019s judiciary and former intelligence minister, Gholam-Hoseyn Mohseni-Ejei, is likely a serious candidate for the role of the Islamic Republic\u2019s next Supreme Leader.<br /></p><p>Mohseni-Ejei possesses formidable credentials for ensuring the survival of the Islamic Revolution, the regime\u2019s highest strategic goal. A longtime insider, his career bridges the two most critical organs of internal regime preservation: the judiciary and the Ministry of Intelligence. He had deep-rooted ties to Raisi, his predecessor as judiciary head, and to the current intelligence minister, Esmail Khatib. These relations reflect decades of institutional collaboration, trust building, and ideological alignment. All three men cut their teeth in the judiciary and intelligence bureaucracy, sharing not only a hardline outlook but close connections with Khamenei. With Raisi gone and the regime under siege, Khamenei may view Mohseni-Ejei as the most experienced and dependable successor to steer the Islamic Republic through a moment of existential peril. If so, he almost certainly will make this known to the Assembly of Experts, the body of clerics that chooses the Supreme Leader.</p><p>Mohseni-Ejei\u2019s ascent is not based merely on his personal ties. It also reflects the growing centrality of the intelligence-security-judiciary triad in safeguarding the regime\u2019s continuity. More recently, as the Israel-Iran war has intensified, Iranian leaders have shifted their focus further inward\u2014 ramping up internal surveillance, searching for traitors, and shutting down communications with the outside world. In this context, his control over the judiciary and having a friend head the Ministry of Intelligence potentially provide Mohseni-Ejei unrivaled leverage over the members of the Assembly of Experts and other powerful figures among Iran\u2019s political factions.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em></em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief has been talking with the foremost experts on the region since the surprise U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear facilities- including former National Intelligence Manager for Iran at ODNI and energy expert Norm Roule and former CIA Director General David Petraeus (Ret.) - about what comes next in Iran.  Watch the interviews exclusively on The Cipher Brief's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@thecipherbrief\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Channel </a>and subscribe to make sure you stay up to date on how the experts see events unfolding.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Under Mohseni-Ejei\u2019s leadership, the judiciary embraced expansive interpretations of national security law to suppress political unrest, ethnic dissent, and defiance of intrusive morality laws. Khatib\u2019s MOIS has worked in tandem, deploying aggressive surveillance and conducting wide-scale arrests to suppress dissent. To relieve some pressure from a public angry about Iran\u2019s failing economy and petty repressive measures such as mandatory hijab, the judiciary has reduced enforcement of some restrictions over the past year. Nonetheless, the collaboration between Mohseni-Ejei and Khatib since 2021 represents one of the most coordinated periods of state repression during the regime\u2019s four-plus decades of existence.</p><p>Crucially, Khamenei\u2019s recent decision to provide the Assembly of Experts with three preferred names\u2014an unprecedented move in the Islamic Republic\u2019s history\u2014suggests a pragmatic urgency favoring survival over process. If Khamenei values institutional loyalty, ideological orthodoxy, and the machinery of domestic control, Mohseni-Ejei may be the logical choice. His past leadership of the MOIS and current control of the judiciary give him operational experience in both managing crises and protecting the Islamic revolution. Moreover, his long-standing ties to Khamenei himself\u2014dating back to his early years monitoring potential \u201cdeviation\u201d within the intelligence services\u2014suggest trust built over decades of mutual survival.</p><p>Critics may cite Mohseni-Ejei\u2019s role in past abuses, including the post-2009 Green Movement crackdown and his promotion of a crackdown on dress code infractions that led to the Mahsa Amini protests of 2022. However, within the current regime such episodes are not stains but qualifications. With the United States now directly involved in the war, Iran\u2019s leadership may gravitate toward a man whose entire career has been defined by countering sedition, exposing conspiracies, and upholding ideological discipline through the courts and the intelligence apparatus.</p><p>In Iran\u2019s increasingly closed and militarized political sphere, the path to supreme authority may not lie in clerical scholarship or charisma, but in institutional command and operational loyalty. Mohseni-Ejei, a consummate enforcer, may well be the last man standing when the Assembly of Experts makes its fateful choice.</p><p><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</strong></em></p><em></em><em></em><em><strong><br /></strong></em>",

    "title": "The Intelligence Behind the Strike: Was Everyone Wrong About Iran\u2019s Nuclear Program?",
    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/intelligence-israel-iran-nuclear-strikes",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>On June 13, 2025, just after midnight, Israel launched a military operation against Iran, citing an urgent need to halt Tehran\u2019s march toward nuclear weapons capability. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu justified the strike by claiming that \"if not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be a year. It could be within a few months\u201d. This justification however is at odds with the consensus held until that point by the U.S. intelligence community and most international nuclear experts. For years, that consensus had held firm: Iran was expanding its civil nuclear program, and continued to enrich uranium but had not made the political decision to build a bomb. If Netanyahu\u2019s claim, echoed by Donald Trump, is accurate then Israel and the USIC must have obtained game-changing intelligence that eluded every major intelligence agency to date. But if the longstanding assessments of the U.S. intelligence community and independent experts still hold true, then the justification for the strike raises the troubling prospect of a politicization of intelligence on a scale not seen since the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq invasion.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Israel\u2019s Strike and Its Rationale</strong></p><p>Just before dawn on June 13, Operation Rising Lion roared to life as <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2025/06/israel-targets-iranian-military-leaders-nuclear-sites-in-wave-of-strikes-idf/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>more than 200 Israeli warplanes</u></a>\u2014including F-35I stealth fighters alongside F-16s and F-15s\u2014took to the skies. In a matter of hours, they unleashed over 330 precision-guided bombs on roughly 100 carefully selected targets across Iran. The strike hit some of the most sensitive and heavily fortified sites in the country: the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, underground nuclear bunkers near Isfahan, missile installations near Tabriz and Kermanshah, and key Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 (IRCG) command centers outside Tehran.</p><p>Crucially, the success of the air campaign rested not only on airpower but on an intricate web of clandestine intelligence operations. In the weeks leading up to the strike, Mossad agents reportedly infiltrated Iranian territory, deploying smuggled drones, decoys, and explosive devices to quietly sabotage critical air defense systems, missile batteries, and radar installations. These covert actions\u2014guided by highly specific intelligence on Iranian military infrastructure and response protocols\u2014crippled Iran\u2019s ability to detect or repel the incoming assault. As a result, Israeli fighter jets were able to penetrate deep into Iranian airspace with minimal early resistance, striking high-value targets with precision and speed.</p><p>The consequences were swift and severe. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/world/middleeast/iran-civilian-deaths-israel-strikes.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Estimates</u></a> of fatal Iranian casualties range from 224 confirmed to over 400, including high-ranking officials\u2014most notably IRGC commanders Hossein Salami and Mohammad Bagheri\u2014and a number of nuclear scientists. Iran has since retaliated with a barrage of missiles and drones targeting Israeli cities\u2014Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Jerusalem\u2014resulting in dozens of civilian and military fatalities and marking the clearest military exchange between the two states on record.</p><p>The scale and precision of Operation Rising Lion made one thing immediately clear: Israel had gathered remarkably detailed intelligence on Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure and military command. Dozens of deeply buried or dispersed facilities were hit simultaneously, demonstrating not only technical and military capability but intimate knowledge gained through intelligence of the locations of key Iranian individual targets and facilities.</p><p>Yet this operational success\u2014and Iran\u2019s response\u2014has in many ways overshadowed the central question of the justification of the operation. On the night of the strike, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that the mission was essential to \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/IsraeliPM/status/1933329728246534596\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>roll back the Iranian threat to Israel\u2019s very survival</u></a>,\u201d warning that Tehran was only a year\u2014possibly even months\u2014away from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Israeli military officials echoed this urgency, claiming they had obtained <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-857595\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>evidence of concrete progress</u></a> in Iran\u2019s efforts to build weapons components, including a uranium metal core and a neutron initiator\u2014technologies central to assembling a functioning nuclear bomb. In short, Israel\u2019s message was unequivocal: this was not a preventive strike based on a theoretical future threat, but a preemptive action against a near-term, tangible nuclear danger.</p><p>But this justification stands in sharp contrast to what most intelligence agencies and nuclear experts believed until now. For years, the broad consensus\u2014shared by the U.S. intelligence community, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and many independent analysts\u2014was that Iran had not yet taken the step toward building a nuclear weapon.</p><p><strong>The Intelligence Picture: What We Knew Before the Strike</strong></p><p>In the lead-up to Israel\u2019s strike, the prevailing view among international intelligence agencies and nuclear experts was that Iran\u2019s nuclear program, while increasingly advanced, had not crossed the threshold into weaponization. Tehran has consistently insisted that its nuclear activities are peaceful and that it has never sought to build a bomb. While a decade-long investigation by the IAEA concluded that Iran conducted work related to nuclear weapons between the late 1980s and 2003\u2014under the now-defunct \u201cProject Amad\u201d\u2014it found that those activities were halted and that there were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/25/06/gov2025-25.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>no credible indications</u></a>\u201d of weapons development after 2009.</p><p>The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed by Iran and six world powers, sought to freeze any weapons pathway by placing strict limits on uranium enrichment and allowing intrusive IAEA inspections in exchange for sanctions relief. That agreement was significantly undermined when the United States withdrew in 2018 under President Donald Trump, reimposing sanctions and prompting Iran to gradually escalate its nuclear activities in retaliation. By 2021, Iran had resumed enrichment at its once-restricted Fordo underground facility, reaching 60% purity\u2014a technically significant step but still short of weapons-grade (90%).</p><p>Most importantly, even amid these breaches, Western intelligence agencies and the IAEA maintained that Iran had not made the political decision to develop a nuclear weapon. Their <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-dramatically-increasing-enrichment-near-bomb-grade-iaea-chief-2024-12-06/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>assessments</u></a> emphasized growing concern over reduced transparency and faster enrichment, but stopped short of declaring that a bomb was imminent. Just days before the Israeli strike the IAEA\u2019s board of governors passed a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/world/middleeast/un-iaea-iran-nuclear-program.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>resolution</u></a> formally declaring Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations\u2014a sign of mounting frustration, but not a definitive confirmation of weaponization. While it is clear that Iran\u2019s nuclear trajectory had become more worrisome in the last few years, the intelligence picture did not suggest that a weapon was imminent\u2014nor that any \u201cpoint of no return\u201d had yet been crossed.</p><p>This restrained view was echoed in the most recent Annual Threat Assessment published by the U.S. intelligence community in March 2025. The <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2025-Unclassified-Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>report</u></a> concluded unequivocally: <em><em>\u201cWe continue to assess Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and that Khamenei has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003, though pressure has probably built on him to do so.\u201d</em></em> It added that <em><em>\u201cin the past year, there has been an erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public that has emboldened nuclear weapons advocates within Iran\u2019s decisionmaking apparatus.\u201d </em></em>In a public hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on March 25, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard supported that view, declaring that Iran was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/gabbard-iran-did-not-restart-nuclear-weapons-program/2025/06/19/39a5034f-5473-43f6-9535-252135e14a6f_video.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>not actively pursuing</u></a> a nuclear weapon.</p><p>The IAEA\u2019s own reporting, released just a week before the Israeli strike, aligned broadly with this perspective. The 22-page declassified report warned that the agency could no longer verify the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, citing a lack of cooperation and unresolved questions about past undeclared activities. However, it did not assert that Iran was actively developing a nuclear weapon or that a threshold had been crossed. While concerns about Iran\u2019s enrichment levels and transparency had undoubtedly intensified, neither the IAEA nor the U.S. intelligence community had concluded that Iran was on the brink of building a bomb. That, until Israel\u2019s operation, remained the shared judgment.</p><p>In a surprising turn on 20 June, Tulsi Gabbard eventually backed President Netanyahu\u2019s claims. As reported by the <em><em>Wall Street Journal</em></em>, Gabbard joined the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/iran-israel-conflict-latest-news/card/gabbard-joined-situation-room-huddle-after-days-of-discord-4JWKzD1iIz5CtR5YSK7o\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>White House Situation Room during U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites</u></a> and clarified later on <a href=\"https://x.com/DNIGabbard/status/1936174674595008517\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>social media</u></a> that \u201cAmerica has intelligence that Iran is at the point it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly\u201d. This shift followed public criticism from Trump\u2014who initially dismissed the ODNI\u2019s testimony and the assessments of the intelligence community as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/gabbard-trump-intelligence-iran-nuclear-program-51c8d85d536f8628870c110ac05bb518\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>\u201cwrong\u201d</u></a>.</p><p>Forceful public assessments like those made by Netanyahu, Trump and Tulsi Gabbard are rarely issued in isolation. In democratic states, such high-stakes declarations\u2014particularly those that pave the way for military action\u2014are almost always grounded, at least in part, in classified intelligence briefings. Operation Rising Lion demonstrated the extraordinary precision and reach of Israeli intelligence, particularly the capabilities of Mossad and the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), suggesting that Israel may indeed have uncovered new and highly specific information that shifted its threat perception. This critical intelligence would no doubt have been shared with the USIC. But these statements raise the critical question of knowing what intelligence exactly did Israelis collect to support such a stark depiction of the Iranian threat. And more broadly, what role did that intelligence play\u2014not just in shaping internal decision-making, but in constructing the public justification for war.</p><p><strong>A Failure to See\u2014or a Case Built to Convince?</strong></p><p>If Israel\u2019s and US - revised - assessments are accurate, then the world has just witnessed one of the most significant failures of intelligence assessments by Western agencies in a very long time. It would suggest that Tehran had quietly advanced past a critical threshold, undetected or underestimated by most intelligence agencies in the world, most notably the U.S. intelligence community. Such a lapse would not only expose a blind spot in monitoring Iran\u2014it would also cast doubt on the broader credibility and responsiveness of the institutions charged with tracking global nuclear threats. After having it right in February 2022 about Russia\u2019s intentions to launch a full scale invasion of Ukraine, did the U.S. intelligence community have it all wrong about assessing Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities?</p><p>But if the prevailing consensus was correct\u2014that Iran had not yet made the decision to build a bomb\u2014then the implications are even more disturbing. In that case, the Israeli and US strikes do not point to a failure of intelligence gathering by western intelligence agencies for several years, but to a serious politicization of intelligence. It would suggest that Operation Rising Lion and Operation Midnight Hammer were not launched in response to an imminent nuclear threat, but rather as the culmination of long-planned military objectives\u2014justified before and after the fact by selectively framed intelligence designed to fit a pre-existing decision for war. It is the kind of political maneuver that will no doubt be scrutinized and debated by intelligence historians for many years.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/nato-s-critical-1-5-percent",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION --</strong> This week's NATO Summit will focus on the proposal that each member raise its overall defense spending to 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). This makes absolute sense because the security investments by America\u2019s European allies, particularly its Western European allies, since the end of the Cold War have been apathetic. In stepping up to properly resource its defense establishments, Europe has to be sure to prioritize more than just planes, tanks, and ships \u2014 but also to invest in the military mobility of NATO forces as well.</p><p>At the summit, leaders of each NATO member state are expected to commit to eventually spending 3.5 percent of their GDP on traditional defense expenditures and another 1.5 percent on defense-related outlays. This defense-related spending is principally infrastructure protection and cybersecurity \u2014 and it is every bit as critical as the euros spent on weapon systems. This underappreciated component of defense spending is essential \u2014 moving troops and equipment efficiently over land, sea, and air is fundamental to NATO\u2019s ability to project power and sustain forces to fight and win wars \u2014 and nothing moves if the trains do not run and the power does not work.</p><p>The Alliance\u2019s authoritarian adversaries \u2014 particularly Russia and China \u2014 know that compromising critical infrastructure through cyber and physical attacks would impede the ability of the United States and its NATO allies to deploy, supply, and sustain military forces. This is why Chinese cyber operators, dubbed \u201cVolt Typhoon,\u201d have prepositioned destructive capabilities in energy, transportation, and communications systems to degrade America\u2019s ability to respond to its aggression against Taiwan. This is why Moscow targeted satellite communication systems to degrade Kyiv\u2019s command and control capabilities as Russian forces crossed Ukraine\u2019s border.</p><p>In the United States, the Pentagon relies on commercially owned transportation networks to move soldiers, supplies, and military equipment. Private and municipally owned electricity, water, and telecommunications utilities supply American military bases. Across Europe, it is the same. NATO forces rely on critical infrastructure owned and operated by local governments and companies. Military readiness depends on asset owners spending resources to ensure reliable, secure infrastructure wherever NATO forces operate.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Upgrade your access to exclusive content by <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\">becoming a subscriber</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>The difference between the United States and NATO is that while the Pentagon has identified the 18 commercially owned strategic seaports, the 70 civilian-owned airfields, and 40,000 miles of commercially owned rail lines it will need to move forces, there is less recognition and agreement within Europe about which transportation networks are most strategically significant. The Supreme Allied Commander Europe\u2019s critical infrastructure priorities are actually straightforward: NATO must be assured that its ability to flow U.S., UK, and French forces into and through Europe is uninterrupted.</p><p>In the face of Russian and Chinese cyber threats, countries across Europe are now starting to rack and stack their cyber resilience investments based on their own assessments of what are the most systemically important entities \u2014 those critical infrastructures upon which their nation\u2019s public health, economic prosperity, and national security rely. However, NATO needs its members to prioritize and invest 1.5 percent of GDP in the cyber and physical security of the assets NATO specifically needs \u2014 the rail lines that will move forces, the power generation facilities that serve its military bases, and the communications networks that ensure secure command and control. These two lists of infrastructures \u2013 individual member states and NATOs - are sometimes not the same.</p><p>Once properly prioritized, the 1.5 percent of GDP invested in critical infrastructures will enhance the ability of governments to provide rapid, actionable information about cyber threats so that operators can thwart attacks. But it is not just better information sharing and response actions. NATO members will also need to provide state funds to small and medium size owners and operators of infrastructure who cannot otherwise make needed, preventative cybersecurity upgrades. And NATO member states will have to identify devices \u2014 including routers, batteries, and optical displays \u2014 made by adversaries like China that could cause infrastructure disruptions, ripping them out of sensitive systems if uninterrupted operation cannot be guaranteed and banning their use moving forward.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>In parallel, the Alliance needs to continue prioritizing critical infrastructure disruption scenarios in tabletop exercises, field training exercises, and wargames so that NATO can identify investments that mitigate the impact of cyber and physical attacks on critical infrastructure. When it is operational, NATO\u2019s forthcoming Integrated Cyber Defense Center can play a key role in both information sharing, strategic planning and asset prioritization.</p><p>For far too long, many NATO allies have ignored Russia\u2019s rapaciousness, China\u2019s authoritarianism, Iran\u2019s terrorism, and North Korea\u2019s bellicosity. They failed to invest in the alliance \u2014 or even their own defense \u2014 and warnings by successive Republican and Democratic presidents went unheeded. Fortunately, President Trump\u2019s vocal complaints about lackluster European defense spending and Vladimir Putin\u2019s violent military aggression against Ukraine have finally convinced NATO members to step up to the plate.</p><p>As member states undertake these significant plus ups in their security budgets, they must remember that airfields, ports, and railways across Europe are strategic military assets. So are pipelines, liquid natural gas terminals, and the power grid. This week\u2019s Summit should serve as a reminder to NATO countries that if they do not invest in the physical and cyber security of these critical infrastructures, their forces might look ready, but only on paper.</p><p><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</strong></em></p>",

    "description": "<p>Steps you can take to report the theft and check if it\u2019s being resold \u2013 as well as how to protect your next one</p><p>Whether you use your bike to commute daily, for a quick trips to the shops or long rides to keep fit, having it stolen can be a nightmare. Here\u2019s what to do if yours goes missing.</p><p>Report the theft to the police and describe the bike in as much detail as possible, giving the model, make and where it was stolen. You should also include a description of any scratches, dents and marks that could help identify it, and a picture if you have one. You can go into your local police station or call 101 in the UK to file a report. Make sure you get a crime reference number.</p><p>Home insurance policies will often cover your bike when it\u2019s at home but you will probably have needed to pay extra to extend this for when you\u2019re out and about, or if you have a valuable bike. Report the loss to your insurer and give it the crime reference number. Your bike will not be covered if you failed to look after it, such as not locking it securely or with a suitable lock.</p><p>Declare your bike stolen on <a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a>, a UK bike database \u2013 you can do this even if you have not registered your bike on there before. It will help improve the chances of your bike being recovered if there are pictures and descriptions of the bike, and where it was stolen.</p><p>Post on bike and cycling forums, such as <a href=\"https://forum.cyclinguk.org/\">Cycling UK Forum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeforums.net/]\">Bike Forum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclechat.net/\">CycleChat</a> in case people come across it when looking to buy a new bike.</p><p>Look on resale sites such as Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace and eBay to see whether someone is trying to sell your bike. You can set up alerts for bikes that are the same make and model. If you find one that looks like yours, alert the police \u2013 they may be able to recover it. It is not advisable to set up a sting or try to deal with the case yourself.</p><p>Alert the local community on neighbourhood forums such as Nextdoor or local Facebook groups and get in touch any bike shops nearby in case someone comes in to the shop and tries to sell one that matches your description.</p><p>Scuff the frame up a bit using sandpaper, paint and stickers so it is less appealing to thieves. Some kitsch, drawn-on hearts might save you a lot of hassle in the future.</p><p>Register it on <a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a> and upload pictures alongside the frame number, which is usually found on the bottom bracket shell between the pedals or on the rear dropouts where the back wheel slots in. This will help the police trace it back to you if it is stolen and recovered.</p><p>Invest in two high-quality locks to make your bike less of a target. At least one of these should be a good-quality D-lock. Be sure to attach the frame to the stand when locking up.</p><p>Take any removable parts with you whenever you leave it.</p><p>Find and apply for your nearest cycle parking. This gives another layer of protection, but be sure to still lock up securely. In cities there are also many cycle hangars, such as Cyclehoop, which are small bike stores on residential streets you can apply for at a small cost each year. <a href=\"https://www.cyclehoop.rentals/\">Check whether there\u2019s one near you</a>.</p><p>Conceal a Bluetooth tracker on your bike to help locate it if it goes missing. The smaller and more discreet the tracker, the better. Good spots to hide them include under the seat or inside the handlebar. Apple AirTag and Tile Sticker are popular among bike owners.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jun/11/what-to-do-if-your-bike-is-stolen-and-how-to-break-the-cycle\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "description": "<p><strong>4 March 1895</strong>: The popularity of cycling among the aristocracy is remarkable as the bicycle used to be looked upon as the poor man\u2019s horse</p><p>The increasing popularity of cycling among the \u2018aristocracy\u2019 is remarkable. Among recent recruits may be mentioned Lord Zetland, Lady Havelock Allan, Sir Joseph Pease, the Earl of Camperdown, the Duke of Westminster, and two of the daughters of the late Earl of Iddesleigh. Heretofore the only objection urged against the pastime has been its vulgarity. The bicycle was looked upon as the poor man\u2019s horse, and those who patronised it were considered very ordinary people. The utility of the bicycle as a means of conveyance, its capacity for causing harmless and elevating pleasure, and its undoubted health-giving qualities were all ignored at the dictates of the fashionable world. The said fashionable world have suddenly discovered the virtues of the cycle, and, ignoring the fact that even butchers\u2019 boys may derive pleasure from the same source, they have taken to it in numbers. The middle class, a large proportion of whom are born snobs, will, now that the only objection is removed, join the ranks in thousand. It will have an effect also even on those who are not snobs.</p><p>Heretofore many professional and business men have been afraid to appear in public on wheels simply because it would damage them from a business point of view. I have known leading doctors who have made a practice of rising in summer at 5am, to enjoy a long ride before breakfast simply because they dared not appear in public except in the irreproachable brougham. For such as these the bar is being removed.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/04/cycling-notes-snobbery-female-riders-and-dispensing-with-a-brake-1895\">Continue reading...</a>",

With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing</span><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1. What is affiliate marketing?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is an affiliate program?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.&nbsp; Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;5. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing?</span></h4><p><!--Ads Managed by AdSpyglass.com-->\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;6. Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7. Where do I find qualified publishers?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius. These networks have a strict application process and compliance checks, which means that all affiliates are trustworthy.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8. What is an affiliate disclosure statement?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;An affiliate disclosure statement discloses to the reader that there may be affiliate links on a website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if visitors follow these links and make purchases.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;9. Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10. What is a super affiliate?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.&nbsp; Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">11. How do we track publisher sales activity?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;12. Could we set up an affiliate program in multiple countries?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country.

If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.</span><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Imagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don\u2019t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That\u2019s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It\u2019s like your computer\u2019s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called \u201cBit Gold.\u201d However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">So, What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:</b></span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain collects information in \u201cblocks\u201d.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blocks form chains, which are called \u201cBlockchains.\u201d</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>Let\u2019s get to know more about the blockchain.</b></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How does blockchain work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Here\u2019s how it works:</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Someone or a computer will transacts</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The transaction is transmitted throughout the network.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A network of computers can confirm the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a block</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The blocks are linked together to create a history.</span></li></ul><p></p>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">And that\u2019s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it\u2019s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.</span></li></ul><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How are Blockchains used?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been\u2014so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is Blockchain Decentralization?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology is safe, even if it\u2019s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called \u201cDecentralization,\u201d meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain guarantees your data's authenticity\u2014not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros and Cons of Blockchain</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Accuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Safe, private, and easy transactions</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Provides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal information</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Cons</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Data storage has limits.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It has a risk of being used for illicit activities&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Frequently Asked Questions About Blockchain</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">I\u2019ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is Blockchain a cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the most prominent blockchain company?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Who owns Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It\u2019s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency&nbsp;</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

Grammarly highlights all the mistakes in your writing within seconds of copying and pasting the content into Grammarly\u2019s editor or using the software\u2019s native feature in other text editors.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Not only does it identify tiny grammatical and spelling errors, it tells you when you overlook punctuations where they are needed. And, beyond its plagiarism-checking capabilities, Grammarly helps you proofread your content. Even better, the software offers a free plan that gives you access to some of its features.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>",

People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1) What is an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFT stands for non-fungible&nbsp; token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2) What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information\u2014such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts\u2014in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can\u2019t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3) What makes an NFT valuable?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br />\n</span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn\u2019t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4) How do NFTs work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can\u2019t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFTs also contain smart contracts\u2014small computer programs that run on the blockchain\u2014that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5) What\u2019s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you\u2019ll be able to upload and sell your creations</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain\u2014the bitcoin ledger of transactions\u2014and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10) How do we buy an NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">11) Can i mint NFT for free?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it?</span></h3>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Why are people investing so much in NFT?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><span>&nbsp;Non-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don\u2019t own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet.</span><br /></span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">That\u2019s a wrap.

Why is email marketing important?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email is the marketing tool that helps you&nbsp; create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak&nbsp; to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is benefits of email marketing?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email marketing is best way for creating long term relationship with your clients, and increasing sales in our company.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Benefits of email marketing for bussiness:</span></div><div><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Better brand recognition</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Statistics of what works best</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More sales</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Targeted audience</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More traffic to your products/services/newsletter</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Build credibility</span></li></ul></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Most&nbsp; bussinesses are using email marketing and making tons of money with email marketing.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Again, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be&nbsp; times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your&nbsp; data to decide.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;4. Which metrics should I be looking at?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The two most important metrics for email marketing are&nbsp; open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5. How do I write a decent subject line?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing&nbsp; the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for&nbsp; A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and&nbsp; simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,&nbsp; then repeated&nbsp; at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example \"Click here to download the premium theme for free.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><br />\n\n<br />6. Is email marketing still effective?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site&nbsp; hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans&nbsp; see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely&nbsp; see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span><br /></span><br />\n\n<br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Buying an email list is&nbsp; waste of time &amp; money. These email accounts are unverified and not interested in your brand. The mailing list is useless if your subscribers do not open your emails. There are different ways to grow your mailing list.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span>Give them a free ebook and host it on a landing page where they have to enter the email to download the file and also create a forum page on your website, asks your visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collects email addresses to follow up with them.</span><br />\n\n<br /></span></div>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a\"></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8. How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">If the&nbsp; subject line of the email is irrelevant to&nbsp; customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus&nbsp; on sales, offers and discounts.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Submit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers. You can also update them on recent trends in your industry. The basic role of an email is first and foremost to&nbsp; connect with customers, get the most out of this tool.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">9. What is the difference between a cold email and a spam email?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Cold emails are mostly sales emails that are sent with content align to the needs of the recipient. It is usually personalized and includes a business perspective. However, it is still an unsolicited email. And all unsolicited emails are marked as SPAM.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Regularly receiving this type of unsolicited email in your users' inboxes, chances are&nbsp; your emails will soon be diverted to&nbsp; spam or junk folders. The most important thing to prevent this from happening is to respect your recipients' choice to opt-out of receiving emails from you. You can add the links to easily unsubscribe. You must be familiar with the CAN-SPAM Act and its regulations.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10. Where can I find email template?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Almost all email campaign tools provide you with ready-made templates. Whether you use MailChimp or Pardot, you'll get several email templates ready to use.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;However, if you want to create a template from scratch, you can do so.Most of email campaign tools have option to paste the HTML code of your own design.&nbsp;</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br />11. What email marketing trend will help marketers succeed in 2022?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is it a trend to listen to&nbsp; and get to know your customers? I think people realize how bad it feels for a brand or a company to obsess over themselves without knowing their customers personal needs. People who listen empathetically and then provide value based on what they learn will win.</span></div></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span><br /></span><span>Final Saying</span></span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;You can approach email marketing in different ways.
