The Associated Press is tracking them in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-europe-hybrid-campaign-d61887dd3ec6151adf354c5bd3e6273e\">a detailed map</a>&nbsp;that shows the breadth of efforts to sow division in European societies and undermine support for Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the latest operation, judicial authorities in Germany issued six arrest warrants for suspects in Russia, two of them accused of being the main leaders of the group, Europol said. Five of them were identified on Europol&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eumostwanted.eu/\">Europe&#8217;s Most Wanted</a>&nbsp;website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One suspect was placed under preliminary arrest in France and another detained in Spain, Europol said. The Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said one person is in custody in France and communications equipment has been seized. No charges have yet been filed. In the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was involved in the operation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The attorney general\u2019s office in Switzerland, which is not an EU member country, said in a statement Wednesday that joint investigations between Europol and Swiss federal police helped identify three leading members of the group, which is alleged to have targeted more than 200 Swiss websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiss prosecutors opened a criminal case over the incidents in June 2023, and since then identified several other denial-of-service attacks attributed to the activist group. The attacks included a video address by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the Swiss parliament and the popular Eurovision Song Contest, held in in Basel earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Europol said members of the cybercrime group initially targeted Ukrainian institutions, \u201cbut have shifted their focus to attacking countries that support Ukraine in the ongoing defence against the Russian war of aggression, many of which are members of NATO.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Law enforcement authorities in countries involved in the operation contacted hundreds of people believed to support the group to inform them of the crackdown and their alleged liability for its actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIndividuals acting for NoName057(16) are mainly Russian-speaking sympathisers who use automated tools to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Operating without formal leadership or sophisticated technical skills, they are motivated by ideology and rewards,\u201d Europol said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It added that people recruited by the group were paid in cryptocurrency and motivated using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-parenting-terror-islamic-state-police-security-attacks-4888bab2d10502edadf787d419d45b5b\">online-gaming dynamics</a>&nbsp;like leader boards and badges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis gamified manipulation, often targeted at younger offenders, was emotionally reinforced by a narrative of defending Russia or avenging political events,\u201d Europol said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u2014Mike Cordor, Associated Press</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Associated Press writers Jamey Keaten, Geir Moulson, and Angela Charlton contributed.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

Just one month later, home prices in the Punta Gorda metro area peaked, and the market slipped into what <em>ResiClub</em> calls \u201ccorrection mode.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2025, the homeowner listed the property for sale at $1,150,000, and the price has since been cut six times, with the most recent asking price at $899,000. The home just went &#8220;pending,&#8221; though it\u2019ll be a few weeks before we know the final sale price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the home ultimately sells for $899,000\u20148.7% below its June 2022 purchase price\u2014the seller might consider themselves lucky. Bank of America\u2019s AVM model (although I take those with a big grain of salt) estimates the home\u2019s value at $721,615, and <em>ResiClub</em>\u2019s analysis of the Zillow Home Value Index shows that home prices in the Punta Gorda metro area are down -18.6% since the market\u2019s July 2022 peak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we\u2019ve closely documented for <em>ResiClub</em> PRO members for quite some time (here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/p/punta-gorda-one-hardest-hit-housing-markets-2008-bubble-burstits-sick\">our feature on just Punta Gorda</a>), Southwest Florida is the weakest regional chunk of the U.S. housing market. While the Austin, Texas metro area has seen a larger overall price drop this cycle (-23% since its 2022 peak), it isn\u2019t experiencing year-over-year price declines as steep as those currently seen in Southwest Florida markets like Cape Coral and Punta Gorda right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91369421\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-1-91369303-southwest-florida-housing-market-material-home-price-correction.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We should point out that the weakness in Southwest Florida\u2014and Florida more broadly\u2014is currently more pronounced in the condo market than in the single-family market. Take Punta Gorda, for example: Single-family home prices are down -13.6% from their 2022 peak, while condo prices there have fallen -20.4%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heading forward, one big question is: Have home prices fallen enough in markets like Punta Gorda and Cape Coral to get the attention of homebuyers, mom-and-pop single-family investors, and single-family acquisition capital? That\u2019s something we\u2019ll do some reporting on in the coming weeks for <em>ResiClub</em> PRO members.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91369423\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-2-91369303-southwest-florida-housing-market-material-home-price-correction.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s the story with Florida\u2014in particular SWFL\u2014right now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <em>ResiClub</em> has previously discussed, Florida&#8217;s particularly intense overheating during the Pandemic Housing Boom is the key reason for its pricing vulnerability right now. While U.S. home prices rose +41% between March 2020 and June 2022, Florida home prices surged +51% over the same period. It just takes a big enough shift in <a href=\"https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/p/key-housing-market-analysis-house-pricing-outlook-2025-2026\">the supply-demand equilibrium</a> for that vulnerability to manifest into falling home prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why has the supply-demand equilibrium in Florida markets recently shifted further toward buyers than in the rest of the nation? <a href=\"https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/p/from-boom-to-correction-5-reasons-florida-s-housing-market-has-weakened\">As <em>ResiClub</em> has previously covered, it\u2019s a combination of 5 factors</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-the-migration-surge-to-florida-fizzled-out\">1) The migration surge to Florida fizzled out</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pandemic Housing Boom\u2019s domestic migration surge to Florida has fizzled out. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/p/net-domestic-migration-which-states-are-gaining-and-losing-americans\">Florida saw net domestic migration of +64K in 2024</a>, compared to +314K in 2022. Without that higher influx of deep-pocketed buyers and second homebuyers from up north, Florida home prices have had to rely more on local incomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"></ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91369430\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-3-91369303-southwest-florida-housing-market-material-home-price-correction.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-surfside-condo-fallout\">2) Surfside condo fallout</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the Surfside condo collapse in June 2021, which killed 98 people, Florida passed new structural safety rules, requiring more inspections and additional funds for repairs to be set aside by the end of 2024. <a href=\"https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/p/spiking-hoa-fees-special-assessments-shake-floridas-housing-market\">That has led to Florida HOAs issuing sky-high special assessments</a> and monthly HOA fee increases to cover these costs. This has had a greater impact on older coastal Florida condo buildings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-hurricane-ian-spurred-a-softening\">3) Hurricane Ian spurred a softening</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hurricane Ian spurred a greater SWFL softening. Markets like Cape Coral and Punta Gorda, which were hard-hit by Hurricane Ian in September 2022, saw thousands of damaged homes, and the subsequent need for renovations. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Hurricane Ian caused an estimated $112.9 billion worth of total damage, making Ian the third-costliest U.S. hurricane on record. This combination of increased housing supply for sale (i.e., the damaged homes), coupled with strained demand (the result of spiked home prices), as well as spiked mortgage rates, higher insurance premiums, and higher HOAs has translated into market softening across much of Southwest Florida.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-new-construction-supply-elasticity\">4) New construction supply elasticity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike many housing markets in the Northeast and Midwest, Florida has a higher level of homebuilding and multifamily construction. As new supply enters the market in this affordability-strained environment, builders are using bigger affordability adjustments\u2014such as mortgage rate buydowns\u2014where needed. This has helped cool the resale market by drawing in some buyers who might have otherwise purchased existing homes. As a result, inventory of existing homes is building up, making Florida one of the few housing markets where <a href=\"https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/p/inventory-is-a-key-housing-metric-here-s-what-it-s-telling-us-right-now\">active listings now exceed pre-pandemic 2019 levels</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"2\"></ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91369431\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-4-91369303-southwest-florida-housing-market-material-home-price-correction.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-home-insurance-shocks\">5) Home insurance shocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past three years, the median annual U.S. home insurance premium has jumped 33%, but Florida homeowners have been hit even harder. The surge in Florida home insurance rates is partly driven by rising replacement costs\u2014home prices and construction costs soared during the boom\u2014and partly by increased hurricane risks and insurance payouts. Florida&#8217;s sharp rise in insurance costs, combined with one of the biggest home price increases during the Pandemic Housing Boom, has led to one of the biggest housing affordability deteriorations.

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91369292/fords-recall-problem-keeps-getting-worse-and-this-one-could-start-fires",
    "description": "<p>Ford is setting records in 2025, but not in a good way. The auto maker has already blown by the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ford-safety-recall-record-df03416d\">previous record</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91366689/over-850000-ford-cars-and-trucks-recalled-nationwide-and-theres-no-fix-available-yet\">most safety recalls</a> in a calendar year, and now another <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=25V467000\">major round</a> of recalls is calling the brand\u2019s reliability into question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Wednesday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced that Ford will recall <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=25V467000\">694,271 crossover SUVs</a> over a fuel leak problem that could cause a fire under the hood. Ford\u2019s 2021-2024 Bronco Sport and 2020-2022 Escape models running 1.5 liter engines were named over concerns that their fuel injectors could crack, leaking fuel into the engine compartment where it could then catch fire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ongoing-concerns\">Ongoing concerns\u00a0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest recall is the result of a year-long investigation, and the company told <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-recalls-over-694000-us-vehicles-over-fire-risk-2025-07-16/\">Reuters</a> that it will cost an estimated $570 million for Ford to resolve, a loss that would be reflected in its second quarter earnings report. Recalls in 2022 and 2024 addressed the same concerns with software updates but didn\u2019t swap out the fuel injectors. Ford shares <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/\">dipped</a> on the news Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NHTSA opened a query into the issue in 2024, prompting the company to reevaluate its recall plan and eventually leading to the broader recall to deal with the injectors themselves, which have been linked to fires even in vehicles with the updated software, Reuters reports. At the time of the prior recalls, Ford said that it was <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91090578/ford-recall-bronco-sport-escape-suvs-fire-risk\">confident</a> the lesser fixes would \u201cprevent the failure from occurring and protect the customer.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To deal with a separate safety concern, Ford recalled <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91366689/over-850000-ford-cars-and-trucks-recalled-nationwide-and-theres-no-fix-available-yet\">more than 850,000 vehicles</a> earlier in July over worries about the low-pressure fuel pumps in some models, including the Bronco, Explorer and Lincoln Aviator. The recall notice noted concerns that a loss of fuel pressure and flow could dangerously lead affected vehicles to stall out. Those worries were especially pronounced in warm weather and \u201clow fuel conditions, and reduced fuel pump internal clearances that result in an increase of internal friction and sensitivity to vapor lock.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-so-many-recalls\">Why so many recalls?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While going public with vehicle problems certainly makes for bad headlines, Ford Chief Operating Officer Kumar Galhotra defended the company\u2019s unprecedented flurry of recalls in comments to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ford-safety-recall-record-df03416d\">the<em> Wall Street Journal</em></a>. \u201cThe increase in recalls reflects our intensive strategy to quickly find and fix any hardware and software issues and go the extra mile to protect customers,\u201d Galhotra said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, Ford CEO Jim Farley said that the company hopes to trim its recall track record by keeping redesigned models for <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-20/ford-recalls-delay-launch-of-new-bronco-and-explorer-models\">up to six weeks</a> for additional extensive quality checks. That move was expected to dent its business in the short term, Farley warned, but the long-term benefits would balance out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to see long term is fewer recalls and lower warranty costs because of this new process,\u201d Farley said in a 2024 earnings call. Since joining Ford in 2020 after two decades at Toyota \u2013 a car brand synonymous with reliability \u2013 Farley has reportedly crusaded to up the auto maker\u2019s quality game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford test drove the new process with a redesigned version of its best-selling model, the F-150 pickup. After holding onto 60,000 fully built vehicles for weeks, the company rooted out issues that would have led to 12 recalls, including assembly problems and software bugs. The company followed suit with updated versions of the Explorer, Bronco and Maverick</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are somewhere in the middle of the pack and obviously we\u2019re not happy with being in the middle of the pack,\u201d Galhotra told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-20/ford-recalls-delay-launch-of-new-bronco-and-explorer-models\">Bloomberg</a> last year. \u201cThe goal is to move very rapidly to catch Toyota.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If all goes as planned, Ford\u2019s new process will reduce recalls for new models as they hit the streets. Ford vehicles already on the road won\u2019t benefit from the additional testing period and are still leading to costly recalls, as recent headlines make clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicle recalls are on the rise in recent years. Between 2013 and 2023, recalls shot up by 43%, according to <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-03/NHTSA-2023-Annual-Recalls-Report_0.pdf\">data</a> from the NHTSA. The increased technological complexity in modern cars means more that can go wrong, but auto makers are also being more proactive in recalling vehicles over potential problems before they can become serious down the road.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with recalls rising across the board, Ford still stands out. Since 2020, the company has held the ignominious title for the most-recalled car manufacturer in the U.S.</p>",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91323805/labubu-new-pop-mart-toy-big-into-energy-sparks-frenzy-crowds-long-lines\">Pop Mart</a> has struck it rich. The Chinese company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers said this week that it expects its profit for the first six months of this year to jump by at least 350% compared with the prior-year period, largely because of its smash hit plush toy, the\u00a0<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/labubu-viral-plushy-influencers-2de46ecf0b2101a16ef6df4e46f4bc48\">Labubu</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pop Mart joins a small list of companies that have tapped into the zeitgeist, drawing in millions of buyers who, for one reason or another, simply must get their hands on a toy or gadget of the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what makes the Labubu a must-have\u2014or any toy for that matter\u2014is a decades-old question that toymakers have yet to figure out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a look at some of the most popular toys over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cabbage-patch-kids\">Cabbage Patch Kids</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cabbage Patch Kids began as chubby-faced dolls with yarn hair that came with adoption papers. During the 1980s, the dolls were so popular that parents waited in long lines at stores while trying to get ahold of them. More than 90 million Cabbage Patch Kids were sold worldwide during their heyday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cabbage Patch Kids were created by Xavier Roberts and initially sold by Coleco. They were relaunched in 2004 amid the successful return of other popular 1980s toys including Strawberry Shortcake, Care Bears, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Cabbage Patch Kid museum named BabyLand General Hospital still exists in Cleveland, Georgia. The dolls were inducted into the\u00a0<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/toy-hall-fame-nerf-popper-cabbage-cards-ce07071adca4eb092ec9b262a12594b3\">National Toy Hall of Fame</a>\u00a0in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-beanie-baby\">Beanie Baby</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/beanie-bubble-film-e8b3f0d8916134bc0cd51a4c2fe2aa7c\">Beanie Babies</a>&nbsp;captivated consumers in the mid-1990s. The cuddly $5 toys were under-stuffed for maximum hug-ability, stamped with cute names on their Ty Inc. tags, and given limited edition runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people collected, traded, and sold the toys with the hopes that their value would just keep going up at the dawn of the e-commerce age. It made some people money, and the founder,\u00a0<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/0731011c9c094b1692f8686038d14373\">Ty Warner</a>, a billionaire in three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, Warner learned that he would not go to prison for hiding at least $25 million from U.S. tax authorities and instead received two years&#8217; probation. Warner, one of the highest-profile figures snared in a federal investigation of Americans using Swiss bank accounts to avoid U.S. taxes, had pleaded guilty to a single count of tax evasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tamagotchi\">Tamagotchi</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for a pet without the real-life responsibilities? Well then, the Tamagotchi electronic pet from Bandai was for you. Consumers were hooked on the egg-shaped plastic toy that first launched in Japan in 1996 and became a craze worldwide in the late 1990s and 2000s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users were tasked with taking care of their virtual pet by pressing buttons that simulate feeding, disciplining, and playing with the critter on-screen. If a Tamagotchi is neglected, it dies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013,\u00a0<a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-ba89c1cdd1094081ab87767b2576d827\">Tamagotchi</a>\u00a0was reborn as a mobile app, duplicating the experience of the plastic handheld toy. The toy was inducted into the\u00a0<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/video-game-hall-of-fame-defender-tamagotchi-2e4ad6ec2258d482dc3a34ed324ee7f5\">World Video Game Hall of Fame</a>\u00a0in May.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fidget-spinner\">Fidget Spinner</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/parenting-general-news-2d9d6c370ff641b6986c77ac951b3e88\">Fidget spinners</a>\u2014the 3-inch twirling gadgets that took over classrooms and cubicles\u2014were all the rage in 2017. The toy was considered somewhat of an outlier at the time, given that it wasn&#8217;t made by a major company, timed for the holiday season, or promoted in TV commercials. Fidget spinners were more easily found at gas stations or 7-Elevens than at big toy chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fidget spinners had been around for years, mostly used by kids with autism or attention disorders to help them concentrate, but they became more popular after being featured on social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While hot toys are often made by one company, fidget spinners were made by numerous manufacturers, mostly in China. The toys were marketed as a concentration aid, but they became so popular among children that many schools started banning them, saying that they were a distraction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-labubu\">Labubu</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/labubu-viral-plushy-influencers-2de46ecf0b2101a16ef6df4e46f4bc48\">Labubu</a>, by artist and illustrator Kasing Lung, first appeared as monsters with pointed ears and pointy teeth in three picture books inspired by Nordic mythology in 2015.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, Lung struck a deal with Pop Mart, a company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers, to sell Labubu figurines. But it wasn\u2019t until Pop Mart started selling Labubu plush toys on key rings in 2023 that the toothy monsters suddenly seemed to be everywhere, including in the hands of Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, and NBA star Dillon Brooks. K-pop singer Lisa of Blackpink began posting images of hers for her more than 100 million followers on Instagram and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/tiktok\" title=\"TikTok\">TikTok</a>, where Labubu pandemonium has broken out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Labubu has been a bonanza for Pop Mart. Its revenue more than doubled in 2024, to 13.04 billion yuan ($1.81 billion), thanks in part to its elvish monster. Revenue from Pop Mart\u2019s plush toys soared more than 1,200% in 2024, nearly 22% of its overall revenue, according to the company\u2019s annual report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u2014By Michelle Chapman, Associated Press business writer </em></p>",

One FDA inspector saw a worker put on a sterile gown and then brush up against a waste bin and use their hands to push down the overflowing trash. Investigators also saw liquid dripping through ceiling cracks and the growth of what appeared to be fungus and mold in a storage area for samples used for testing.</p>\n\n<p>The FDA in late 2022 had banned the factory in the city of Halol from shipping drugs to the United States because of similar manufacturing failures.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/fda-drug-loophole-sun-pharma\">ProPublica reported last month</a> that a low-profile group inside the agency at the same time exempted some medications from that ban, ostensibly to prevent drug shortages. The FDA has granted similar exemptions for drugs made at more than 20 other foreign factories that violated critical standards in drugmaking and were barred from the U.S. market.</p>\n\n<p>The FDA kept the practice largely hidden from the public. The agency did not regularly test drugs coming from the banned factories or proactively monitor reports about potential harm among consumers, ProPublica found.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In Sun\u2019s case, more than a dozen drugs were initially excluded from the Halol import ban. The company is still allowed to send five to the United States, <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_189.html\">government records show</a>, including vecuronium bromide, a muscle relaxer used during surgery, and the cancer drug doxorubicin. Also excluded are divalproex delayed release tablets, which treat seizures and other conditions; leuprolide injection, used by people with prostate cancer, endometriosis and other conditions; and temozolomide capsules, for brain cancer.</p>\n\n<p>The inspection last month marked the first time the FDA had been back to the factory in the 2.5 years since it imposed the import ban and Sun started sending exempted drugs to the United States. Inspectors found that procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of sterile drugs were not established or followed and that equipment wasn\u2019t maintained to prevent malfunctions that would \u201calter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the drug product,\u201d according to the report. </p>\n\n<p>Some of the concerns focused on the exempted drugs still being sent to the United States, according to a person familiar with the situation who did not want to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The FDA <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25998843-sun-pharma-2025-483/#document/p15/a2664414\">blacked out the names of the drugs</a> that were potentially compromised on its publicly released inspection report, including a medication made on a manufacturing line in which several batches had to be rejected because they were filled with black particles.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            A portion of the FDA\u2019s June inspection report redacted the names of potentially compromised drugs manufactured by Sun that continue to be released to the U.S. market.\n    \n            (Obtained by ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see issues continue to come up at this site given the site\u2019s role in potentially manufacturing critical drugs for U.S. consumers,\u201d said the person familiar with the inspection findings. </p>\n\n<p>Sun did not respond to questions about the latest inspection or its regulatory history with the FDA. In an email, the company said that adherence to quality standards \u201cis a top priority for Sun, and we maintain a relentless focus on quality and compliance to ensure the uninterrupted supply of medicines to our customers and patients worldwide. We continue to work proactively with the US FDA and remain committed to achieve full resolution of any FDA regulatory issues at our facilities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The FDA said factories that receive exemptions from import bans are required to conduct extra testing on drugs with third-party oversight before they are sent to the United States, helping to ensure patient safety. Sun\u2019s Halol plant, however, was cited in 2022 and again last month for failing to thoroughly investigate unexplained quality problems, including impurities, found during drug testing. The FDA did not respond to a request for comment about the latest Sun inspection. </p>\n\n<p>U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Michigan, who recently <a href=\"https://debbiedingell.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5712\">co-sponsored a bill</a> to lower prescription drug costs, said in a statement to ProPublica that the FDA has a responsibility to ensure that drugs coming into the country are safe.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe need full transparency about the extent to which exemptions enabled sub-par, unsafe, or ineffective drugs to be distributed to American patients,\u201d she said.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Medill Investigative Lab student Katherine Dailey contributed reporting.</p>",

Trump also issued an ultimatum of additional U.S. sanctions if Russian President Vladimir Putin fails to end his attacks and agree to a ceasefire within 50 days \u2013 as of Monday.</p><p>Amid the barrage of Russian attacks, experts note that the commitment of additional Patriot systems will allow Ukraine to defend itself but won\u2019t do much to move the needle toward ending the war, unless Putin flinches at the threat of sanctions, which he has not done. \u201cUkraine was given just enough support not to lose against Russia under President Joe Biden, but never enough support to actually win and end this war,\u201d writes former Chief of CIA\u2019s Central Eurasia Division Rob Dannenberg in a piece exclusive to <em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/trump-winning-president-ukraine\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> </em>this week. Meanwhile, there are signs that President Trump\u2019s patience is wearing thin.</p><p>The White House responded yesterday to the readout of a July 4 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that signaled the president\u2019s interest in Ukraine\u2019s ability to launch <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b66f03b5-e295-4f8c-92ba-516a527d588c\" target=\"_blank\">deep strikes</a> on Russian territory. Sources familiar with the call said Trump asked Zelensky, \u201cVolodymyr, can you hit Moscow? Can you hit St. Petersburg, too?\u201d Zelensky reportedly replied, \u201cAbsolutely. We can, if you give us the weapons.\u201d</p><p>While the administration downplayed the report, saying President Trump \u201cwas merely asking a question, not encouraging further killing,\u201d a White House spokesperson said Trump also said Zelensky \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-zelenskiy-should-not-target-moscow-2025-07-15/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shouldn\u2019t target Moscow</a>\u201d. In the meantime, Kyiv has been incredibly innovative in working with what it has available, to strike at the heart of Russian aggression.</p><p>On June 1, in a military strike that stunned analysts worldwide, Ukraine launched a bold drone operation\u2014dubbed <em>Spider\u2019s Web</em>\u2014that struck four Russian air bases <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/graphics/UKRAINE-CRISIS/DRONES-RUSSIA/mypmjzayyvr/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">up to</a> 3,000 miles from Kyiv, reportedly destroying or damaging a dozen nuclear-capable bombers. Satellite imagery suggests that among the damaged aircraft were Tu-95s and Tu-22s, long-range bombers used to launch cruise missiles at Ukraine.</p><p>The drones\u2014simple quadcopters costing less than $1,000\u2014were reportedly guided through Russia\u2019s own 4G <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2025/06/ukrainian-attack-on-russian-bombers-shows-how-cheap-drones-could-upset-global-security/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">networks</a> and possibly using AI to avoid detection and strike with precision. While Moscow denied any significant damage and threatened retaliation, Western analysts saw something more significant: a clear sign that modern warfare is entering a new era. Small, inexpensive drones can now slip past advanced air defenses, giving countries like Ukraine a way to challenge far larger militaries.</p><p>However, the implications go far beyond Ukraine and Russia. The operation sent a clear message to militaries worldwide: Ukraine can strike deep into enemy territory with precision and surprise\u2014and others could, too.</p><p>\u201cIt suggests a new angle of surprise attack that our defenses need to adjust to,\u201d Kori Schake, director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt\u2019ll be very difficult to calibrate warning against small drone attacks. You can bet militaries are scrambling to figure it out.\u201d</p><p><strong>Moment of Reckoning</strong></p><p>While Russia\u2019s immediate damage was a significant setback, the true shockwave from Ukraine\u2019s <em>Spider\u2019s Web</em> operation spread far beyond the battlefield.</p><p>Military experts worldwide recognized this attack as a clear warning\u2014exposing new vulnerabilities and signaling a shift in how modern warfare will be fought.</p><p>U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/04/ukraine-attacks-us-dangers-aircraft-00385666\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">referred</a> to it as a \u201cwake-up moment,\u201d noting the sheer magnitude of destruction and the ease with which it was executed. As U.S. aircraft continue to sit exposed on runways across the Pacific and homeland, the risk of similar strikes has become more than theoretical.</p><p>Nolan Peterson, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and former Air Force Special Operations pilot, concurs that the operation was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the Pentagon and \u201cshowed how drones are now a bridge between conventional and unconventional combat, having democratized long-range, precision strike capabilities that were once exclusive to conventional state militaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the hands of conventional and unconventional operators, drones can have tactical, operational, and strategic effects \u2014 from precision strikes on the battlefield to disabling power stations and oil refineries, shutting down airports, or destroying nuclear-capable bombers sitting on the tarmac at an air base,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd, even if they are armed with relatively weak munitions, small drones now offer America\u2019s adversaries a low-cost, plausibly deniable way to spread panic and paralyze our economy.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

Coordination between federal agencies is sluggish, legal authorities are fragmented, and training at the base level hasn't kept pace with the growing threat, something U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth promises to change with a new plan to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJxD-Bjqk3w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">modernize DoD\u2019s use of drones</a>.</p><p>But beyond the technical vulnerabilities, the strategic implications of the June 1 strike are far-reaching. A new reality is emerging\u2014one in which commercial drones launched from anywhere near a military site, concealed in barns, trucks, or civilian buildings, can carry out devastating attacks once reserved for high-end missiles. As military drone technology becomes more autonomous and lethal, the urgency to adapt grows by the day.</p><p>\u201cMilitaries can\u2019t just rely on missiles and stealth jets anymore,\u201d said Nolan Peterson, former Air Force Special Operations pilot. \u201cDrones now serve as the bridge between conventional and unconventional warfare, granting near-peer capabilities to smaller actors.\u201d</p><p>Peterson warned that even relatively weak munitions, when paired with drone agility and scale, can paralyze economies, take down power grids, or disable key strategic aircraft\u2014often without attribution.</p><p>\u201cThis is the democratization of strategic strike,\u201d he said.</p><p>The United States, he added, must recognize that air superiority now hinges not only on dominance in the skies\u2014but in the so-called <em>air littoral</em>, the low-altitude zone where small drones thrive.</p><p>\u201cWe need a layered defense that combines traditional systems with new tech specifically designed to track and eliminate small UAVs, including both kinetic interceptors and directed energy weapons,\u201d Peterson said.</p><p><strong>In the future</strong></p><p>The June 1 drone strikes marked a turning point in global stability, exposing how small, low-cost drones can now threaten even the nuclear assets of major powers\u2014something once only possible for other nuclear states.</p><p>Traditional doctrines designed to prevent nuclear escalation were never built to handle strikes from smaller, non-nuclear actors like Ukraine or to anticipate the risk posed by non-state groups potentially launching false-flag operations to provoke conflict. As drones become cheaper and more accessible, their disruptive power demands urgent attention\u2014in ethical debates around AI autonomy and regulatory efforts to prevent misuse.</p><p>So, what can be done?</p><p>Justin Bronk, Senior Research Fellow for Airpower and Technology in the Military Sciences team at the Royal United Services Institute, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em> that the United States and most other NATO air forces should \u201curgently invest in reconditioning old Hardened Aircraft Shelters and building new ones since aircraft stored in such shelters when not in use are essentially invulnerable to small UAV attacks and are also much safer against a host of other potential threats than when out in the open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardened Aircraft Shelters are not difficult or high-risk technologies; their utility is clear against the threat, and Russia has already started building new ones at multiple fighter bases to defend against Ukrainian strikes,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cSecondarily, air forces need to both invest in soft-kill anti-UAV defenses such as jammers but recognize that the main defense against such attacks by infiltration teams with large numbers of explosive-equipped UAVs has to be the intelligence and security services.\u201d</p><p>Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research and the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, points out that now that the mode of the \u201csurprise\u201d attack is known, \u201cit is conceivable that people will start taking appropriate defensive measures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLight nets over aircraft, for example, jamming mobile networks, these kinds of things,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, it will add complexity and cost to operations, and no defense is perfect, but a reasonable defense is not impossible.\u201d</p><p>Some analysts also warn that governments <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2025/06/ukrainian-attack-on-russian-bombers-shows-how-cheap-drones-could-upset-global-security/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">may need</a> to treat small drones more like firearms, implementing tighter export controls and purchase restrictions, even if doing so would impede the booming commercial drone market. The attack also raises questions about artificial intelligence and its role on a drone-dominated battlefield in the future.</p><p>\u201cAI in weapons systems is nothing new, but the off-the-shelf and cheap implementation of AI is revolutionary,\u201d Retired Special Forces Colonel Jason Amerine tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cBillion-dollar weapons programs look silly in the face of Ukraine\u2019s ingenuity. The lesson I take away is the constant reminder that we can do things much more cheaply and elegantly with significant cost savings.\u201d</p><p>He also observed that while the U.S. military has developed a \u201crobust short-range air defense capability,\u201d it still lacks \u201can extensive and inexpensive counter-drone system\u201d that can be deployed at scale.</p><p>\u201cLegacy platforms like the aging Avenger can be upgraded to help plug some of the gaps,\u201d Amerine continued. \u201cBut the long-term solution lies in funding experimental laser weapons and spectrum dominance systems. With enough investment, lasers and jamming tech could provide a cost-effective way to neutralize small drones before they strike.\u201d</p><p>Peterson, however, contends that it was the \u201cskills of Ukraine\u2019s drone operators that made the operation a success \u2014 along with tradecraft, covert logistics, and a host of other operational achievements that had nothing to do with technology.\u201d</p><p>In any case, <em>Operation Spider\u2019s Web</em> marked a critical moment in modern warfare, revealing how low-cost, commercially available drones can deliver devastating blows to even the most fortified military assets.</p><p>The assault exposed how vulnerable even the most advanced militaries are to cheap, small, and easily concealed weapons. Dozens of AI-enabled drones were launched from within Russian territory, damaging or destroying a significant number of nuclear-capable bombers. These aircraft had been central to Russia\u2019s ability to fire long-range, hard-to-intercept cruise missiles\u2014now, that capability is diminished.</p><p>Rather than high-end equipment, the attack relied on ingenuity, autonomy, and scale-transforming commercial-grade drones into strategic weapons.</p><p>\u201cAbove all, America\u2019s military leaders need to understand that you cannot have air superiority, supremacy, or dominance without also controlling the so-called air littoral \u2014 the low altitude airspace at which small drones operate,\u201d Peterson explained. \u201cWe need a layered approach, pairing traditional air defense systems with new technologies purpose-built to detect and destroy small drones. And this included both kinetic and directed energy systems.\u201d</p><p>Yet Schake is \u201cnot convinced yet that it revolutionizes warfare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt signals that small, cheap, disposable drones are a genuine threat to expensive, exquisite platforms,\u201d she added. \u201cIt makes restoring mobility on the battlefield a real challenge, and it imposes cost-exchange ratios unfavorable to expensive platforms, but it\u2019s not a substitute for taking and holding territory.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

    "description": "<p>Socially anxious Gen Zers, rejoice: Google\u2019s new <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> search feature will make phone calls so you don\u2019t have to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature, which launches today, is designed to help users check current pricing and availability for services at local businesses through an AI-powered calling function. According to a Google spokesperson, it\u2019s an example of how <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91362284/agentic-ai-is-driving-a-complete-rethink-of-compute-infrastructure\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">agentic AI</a>\u2014or a model <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91314749/agentic-ai-the-next-big-shift-in-how-we-work-and-innovate\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">capable of thinking, planning, and acting autonomously</a> in real time\u2014can help make everyday tasks easier by acting on behalf of a user.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"An interface that shows a message from Google following use of the Google AI-powered calling to contact a business.\" class=\"wp-image-91369228\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-1-91368534-google-new-ai-features.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Image: Google]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the spokesperson says that the tool was made for all users, the Google team thinks it might be particularly helpful for Gen Zers, who tend to be more reticent to make phone calls than other generations. <a href=\"https://www.uswitch.com/media-centre/2024/04/Call-me-maybe-quarter-young-people-never-answer-phone/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A 2024 study</a> by the company Uswitch showed that a quarter of 18- to 34-year-olds never answer the phone at all. The phenomenon even has a name: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgklk3p70yo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">telephobia</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to internal Google data, users aged 18\u201324 already show higher engagement than other generations when they use Google&#8217;s existing AI Overviews tool in search. Now, Google is hoping that agentic AI might also help young users tackle certain quotidian tasks without ever picking up the phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"overflow: hidden; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-bot-for-appointments-and-inquiries\">An AI bot for appointments and inquiries</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To use the new tool, users simply need to search a query related to local small businesses, like,&nbsp;\u201cnail salons near me\u201d or \u201clocal dog groomers.\u201d These types of requests will yield a prompt that says, \u201cHave AI check pricing\u201d directly beneath the map of suggested businesses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a user clicks that prompt, they\u2019ll be taken through a short questionnaire related to their needs\u2014in the dog groomer example, that might mean follow-ups like, \u201cwhat kind of dog do you have?\u201d or \u201cwhat service do you need?\u201d&nbsp;Using those responses, an AI will then make calls to several of the top suggested businesses based on Google reviews, and return to the user with an email or text of each pet groomer\u2019s response. While this questionnaire step does take some extra time, the spokesperson notes that it saves the user from needing to make all of the calls themselves, and the whole process should take 30 minutes or less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the business end, the tool sets a daily limit of how many times one business can be contacted within a day, as well as providing each business an opportunity to opt out of the calls if they choose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Google&#8217;s AI-powered calling feature is available for a select group of local business categories, including beauty and wellness, auto maintenance, pet services, and professional services. In the future, though, the Google spokesperson says there\u2019s plenty of room to expand this option to additional domains. It\u2019s essentially outsourcing the drudgery (and, for some Gen Zers, anxiety) of making a new appointment to your own personal assistant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91210956/ftc-tackles-subscription-frustration-makes-canceling-easier-for-consumers\">A &#8220;click-to-cancel&#8221; rule</a>, which would have made it easier for consumers to end unwanted subscriptions, has been <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91365331/canceling-subscriptions-about-get-easier-federal-court-blocked-ftc-rule\">blocked by a federal appeals court</a> days before it was set to go into effect. But there are ways to end those subscriptions and memberships, even if they take some work.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91171556/how-ftc-will-make-easier-for-you-click-unsubscribe\">The rule</a> would also have required companies to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end and let customers cancel recurring subscriptions as easily as they started them. But even without the new federal guidance, here are some ways to stay on top of subscription and membership fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-use-calendar-reminders-and-regularly-review-your-bills\">Use calendar reminders and regularly review your bills</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts at the Consumer Federation of America recommend setting calendar reminders for whenever a free trial period ends, to alert yourself to cancel promotional offers before the real recurring costs kick in. The auto-enrollment process, in which the company does not remind the consumer via email that a trial is about to end and higher monthly payments will begin, was also at the heart of the FTC&#8217;s rule.<br /><br />&#8220;No subscription business model should be structured to profit from a gauntlet-style cancellation process,&#8221; said Erin Witte, Director of Consumer Protection for the Consumer Federation of America, in a statement on the click-to-cancel rule.<br />Regularly reviewing your credit card and debit card bills can also help you keep track of any recurring charges\u2014including price increases you may have missed or that you didn&#8217;t anticipate when trying out a new membership or subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-know-the-terms-and-conditions-of-a-given-subscription\">Know the terms and conditions of a given subscription</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Companies make it easy for consumers to click to sign up and easy for the companies to automatically withdraw funds from consumers&#8217; accounts,&#8221; said Shennan Kavanagh, Director of Litigation at the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) in a statement on the FTC&#8217;s click-to-cancel rule. &#8220;People should not (have to) spend months trying to cancel unwanted subscriptions.&#8221;<br /><br />Given the FTC&#8217;s vacated rule, though, companies may still legally require that customers cancel memberships or subscriptions by phone, even as they permit signing up, enrolling, and paying bills online. Consumer advocates say this places an extra burden of time and energy on the consumer to stop an unwanted recurring fee, but sometimes knowing the terms of the subscription and getting on the phone is worth the trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-there-are-some-services-that-unenroll-you\">There are some services that unenroll you</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apps like Rocket Money and services like Trim, which is accessed through a browser, can keep track of your recurring monthly fees and subscriptions, for free\u2014or for a fee\u2014and can help you catch new ones or even unsubscribe from some services.<br /><br />For parents, especially, a service like Trim could help inform them that a child has started a new subscription, game or membership before the fees recur. And Rocket Money will actively work to end unwanted subscriptions for you, for a monthly price. If the company can&#8217;t successfully end or cancel the subscription or membership, it will give the customer the information needed to do so. Trim also provides this service, in its premium form, for an additional fee.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-resist-deals-when-canceling\">Resist deals when canceling</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The FTC is currently moving forward with preparations for a trial involving Amazon&#8217;s Prime program, which accuses the retailer of enrolling consumers in its Prime program without their consent and making it difficult to cancel subscriptions.<br /><br />Often, when a consumer tries to cancel a subscription for something like Prime, which offers free delivery and streaming video, the company will offer a month or more of the subscription at a promotional rate\u2014half off, or at other, better-seeming values, to entice a customer to stay. Staying strong in the face of what may appear to be a good deal can help you stop recurring monthly fees before you forget to cancel them again.<br /><br />Agreeing to yet another trial or promotional rate, which is another on-ramp to auto-enrollment, just continues the cycle, according to consumer advocates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-would-the-ftc-s-rule-have-done\">What would the FTC&#8217;s rule have done?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The FTC&#8217;s rule would have required businesses to obtain a customer&#8217;s consent before charging for memberships, auto-renewals and programs linked to free trials. The businesses would have also had to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end.<br /><br />The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said this week that the FTC made a procedural error by failing to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis, which is required for rules whose annual impact on the U.S. economy is more than $100 million.<br /><br />The FTC said that it did not have to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis because it initially determined that the rule&#8217;s impact on the national economy would be less than $100 million. An administrative law judge decided that the economic impact would be more than the $100 million threshold, and the court decided to vacate the rule.<br /><br />Former President Joe Biden&#8217;s administration had included the FTC&#8217;s proposal as part of its &#8220;Time is Money&#8221; initiative, which aimed to crack down on consumer-related hassles.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

    "description": "<p>If you haven\u2019t yelled \u201cDRAW FOUR\u201d across a sticky bar table lately, Mattel wants to change that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This weekend in Las Vegas, the company behind one of the world\u2019s most iconic card games is launching something totally new: <em>UNO Social Club</em>, a real-life version of game night with a serious glow-up. The first one opens July 18 at the Palms Casino Resort, turning a suite into a full-on UNO-themed playground\u2014complete with a private bowling alley, color-drenched d\u00e9cor, and more versions of the game than you knew existed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The launch event is part of Mattel\u2019s larger strategy to turn UNO into a lifestyle brand. Designed for what the company calls the \u201csocially distant generation,\u201d UNO Social Clubs are meant to create new touch points for younger players who might be less interested in family game night and more interested in turning game play into a night out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGen Z already loves UNO,\u201d Ray Adler, Mattel\u2019s VP and Global Head of Games tells <em>Fast Company</em>. \u201cThey\u2019ve been playing it online, at parties, everywhere. What they don\u2019t always have are opportunities to connect in the real world\u2014so we asked: What if game night could be a whole experience?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer? A rainbow-colored suite at the Palms packed with UNO-inspired d\u00e9cor and stocked with specialty decks like <em>UNO Golf</em>, <em>UNO Show \u2018Em No Mercy</em>, and <em>UNO Teams</em>. There\u2019s even a dedicated UNO host to keep the games flowing and the trash talk civil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Vegas suite is just the opening hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-uno-but-make-it-nightlife\">UNO, but make it nightlife</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in August, UNO will be taking over bars in five major cities\u2014from L.A. to Austin\u2014with pop-up Social Clubs designed to turn everyday hotspots into the ultimate competitive hangout. Think: UNO-themed d\u00e9cor, tournament-style gameplay on official tables, and selfie-friendly backdrops. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each local UNO Social Club will bring its own twist. In L.A., the party lands at Club Tee Gee\u2019s open-air patio in Atwater Village. In NYC, it\u2019s taking over the downtown favorite Cowgirl. Chicago\u2019s Empty Bottle will transform its dance floor into a card-slinging arena. Atlanta\u2019s Ormsby\u2019s will host in its basement bar, and Austin\u2019s Murray\u2019s Tavern will close out the summer tour with cocktails and custom card games under the Texas sky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These aren\u2019t family-friendly sit-downs with juice boxes\u2014they\u2019re designed with Gen Z sensibilities in mind. Attendees can win custom UNO merch, product packs, and exclusive giveaways while battling it out over classic UNO, UNO Golf, and UNO Teams. The point is less about who wins and more about the connection and memories made along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mattel chose venues specifically for their Gen Z appeal\u2014places that already host game nights, trivia, or other community events\u2014so UNO fans don\u2019t have to shift their habits to show up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo ticketing system, no velvet rope,\u201d Adler explains. \u201cWe want people to stumble upon it, hang out, maybe discover a new favorite way to play\u2014and then take that energy with them.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each pop-up is tailored to the local scene, bringing in unique variations of the game and adapting to each location\u2019s vibe. While the Vegas suite leans into spectacle, the bars will focus on accessibility and cultural relevance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-uno-is-growing-up-but-staying-chaotic\">UNO is growing up\u2014but staying chaotic</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand has been on a hot streak. UNO was the top-selling traditional game during the pandemic, as people rediscovered old favorites while stuck at home. Now, Mattel\u2019s aim is to keep that momentum going\u2014with variations that bring chaos, strategy, and, yes, pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPeople asked for something more brutal,\u201d Adler says. \u201cSo we made <em>Show \u2018Em No Mercy.</em>\u201d That deck includes game-changing twists and double-digit draw penalties that can knock players out of the game entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the classic version still sells strong, it\u2019s the newer spinoffs\u2014like UNO Flip or UNO Attack\u2014that are resonating with gamers who crave novelty. Mattel now views the brand as a cultural bridge: a game you played with your family, yes, but also one that evolves with you as you grow up\u2014and grow more competitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate goal? Make UNO something you never outgrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-uno-goes-lifestyle\">UNO goes lifestyle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mattel\u2019s bet on UNO as a lifestyle brand is part of a larger push happening across the $19.5 billion tabletop games market. That market is projected to grow to $34.1 billion by 2030 <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/26/3032626/28124/en/Tabletop-Games-Market-Growth-Forecasts-2025-2030-Rising-Popularity-of-European-Style-Tabletop-Games-Strategy-Games-as-Market-Leaders-A-34-1-Billion-Market-by-2030.html\">according to Research and Markets</a>, with a nearly 10% annual growth rate. And while big names like Mattel and Hasbro still dominate the space, smaller indie brands are gaining traction thanks to clever design and grassroots followings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strategy games, in particular, are fueling the boom\u2014especially those that combine competitive chaos with social connection. It\u2019s exactly the niche UNO is now trying to own.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-new-kind-of-brand-loyalty\">A new kind of brand loyalty</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just about nostalgia. The surge in tabletop gaming\u2014fueled by Euro-style strategy games, hybrid digital-analog formats, and board game caf\u00e9s\u2014reflects a growing appetite for IRL interaction in a screen-saturated world. Educational games, RPGs, and collectible card games are all seeing major traction, especially in North America and Europe, with APAC quickly catching up thanks to a booming interest in social gaming and game caf\u00e9s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Barbie was Mattel\u2019s all-pink lifestyle moment, UNO is aiming to become the game night version. But instead of museum-style installations or scripted nostalgia, this is about high-energy interactivity. It\u2019s less about buying the product and more about stepping into its world\u2014even if just for a drink, a draw four, and a photo op.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe want to create spaces that feel familiar but elevated,\u201d Adler says. \u201cIf a bar was built with UNO in mind, what would it look like? That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to answer.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What UNO is doing fits squarely into that trend. It\u2019s social. It\u2019s competitive. And it\u2019s chaotic in the best way. And if the Vegas launch goes well\u2014and enough people show up ready to shuffle\u2014this could be the beginning of a very colorful new era for game night.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION --</strong> Today, the Central Intelligence Agency faces a crisis of trust. While CIA officers have long confronted adversaries abroad, the Agency now finds itself navigating an increasingly politicized relationship with the American public it serves.</p><p>A dangerous perception has taken root in recent years, namely that the CIA, intended to be apolitical by design, has become a partisan actor in our polarized national politics. If left unaddressed, this perception threatens not only the Agency\u2019s effectiveness but, by extension, the country\u2019s broader national security. Reflecting on my 34-year career in intelligence and nearly a decade beyond it, I recognize that such existential challenges, though rare, are not unprecedented. And there are ways to recover.</p><p>In the more than four decades since I first took the oath of office as a new CIA operations officer, I cannot recall a time when CIA was not confronted with daunting challenges. From the Cold War through the 1990\u2019s when we dealt with what then-Director James Woolsey called \u201ca jungle full of a number of poisonous snakes,\u201d to the post-9/11 war against jihadi terror and the reappearance of peer competitors, there was never a time when the Agency was not called upon to provide crucial intelligence on, and sometimes to directly confront, our nation\u2019s adversaries. I imagine those serving today face similarly formidable tasks: from countering China\u2019s rise, dealing with Russian irredentism and Iranian-inspired terrorism, to integrating <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/to-counter-china-reform-u-s-intelligence-for-the-digital-age\" target=\"_self\">cutting-edge AI</a> across the breadth of Agency operations, and rebuilding the service\u2019s human intelligence arm after the severe damage wrought by the \u2018reorganization\u2019 of 2015.</p><p>I can, however, recall only a few times when the Agency\u2019s existence was existentially challenged. The Church Committee and \u2018Time of Troubles\u2019 of the mid-1970\u2019s, were before my time. But I served during the interregnum of the 1990\u2019s, when some misguided souls thought we had reached the end of history and that, with the demise of the \u2018Evil Empire,\u2019 the nation no longer needed an intelligence service. I was also there in the post-9/11 era when the Agency was assigned disproportionate blame for that murderous assault on our nation. The professionalism and effectiveness of CIA officers in carrying out the Agency\u2019s mission were ultimately proof against those efforts to dismantle the organization.</p><p>Today, as I look at CIA from afar, it seems to me yet again to be under existential threat because many of the citizens the Agency serves have come to see it as an adversary. In truth, there has always been a particular tension in the juxtaposition between the secret world in which Agency officers live and the values of the democracy they serve. Even Presidents have sometimes voiced discomfort with the nature of the CIA\u2019s mission. President Harry S. Truman judged that \u201csecrecy and a free, democratic government don\u2019t mix.\u201d John F. Kennedy thought that \u201cthe very word secrecy\u2019 is repugnant in a free and open society.\u201d Those views are reflective of the uneasiness of the American people with the secret world and with actions seen or portrayed as less than honorable that are undertaken in their name. Former CIA Director Richard Helms addressed this inherent friction between secrecy and democracy when he wrote that \u201cthe nation must take it to a degree on faith that we, too, are honorable men dedicated to their service.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>What national security news are you missing today?

I will never forget watching the cheering crowd in front of the White House hailing CIA and the U.S. military in the wake of our delivery of justice to Osama Bin Laden. But, for the most part, the American people seemed in accord with the reluctant toleration of the Agency\u2019s activities expressed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower when he pronounced intelligence \u201ca distasteful but vital necessity.\u201d They seemingly understood that CIA has an incredibly difficult job, and that, consequently, its officers must \u2013 as John le Carre wrote in <em>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</em> \u2013 sometimes \u201cdo disagreeable things so that ordinary people here and elsewhere can sleep safely in their beds at night.\u201d</p><p>Public opinion surveys show confidence in the CIA has experienced fluctuations over time, marked by periods of erosion and recovery. Such shifting views of CIA are understandable given its role. An assertion by the Agency\u2019s first Director, Allen Dulles, that an issue under discussion in his time was \u201ca policy matter and not my job\u2019 notwithstanding, CIA has often found itself at the center of policy debates.</p><p>I can recall seemingly innumerable instances over the course of my career when the Agency, invariably hindered by its secret nature in defending itself, was used as a political football in all too often internecine arguments.</p><p>Of late, however, public confidence in the CIA has eroded significantly compared to previous decades. While most Americans still view the Agency as vital to national security, there are persistent and growing concerns about civil liberties, partisanship, and transparency.</p><p>Partisan polarization is a particular concern as trust in the CIA is increasingly shaped by political affiliation. Support among Democrats grew during the Biden administration, while Republican support declined. Moreover, Americans are more likely to judge the CIA\u2019s performance based on their alignment with the sitting president. Given the dictates of our democratic system, that perception of <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/402464/government-agency-ratings-cia-fbi-federal-reserve-down.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">political bias</a> portends serious problems not only for CIA\u2019s mission-effectiveness, but potentially for its very existence, if not addressed. </p><p>In order to do so, it is necessary to ask how that perception took hold. How did CIA which, by definition, must be an apolitical organization, come to be tarred with a partisan brush? Some will see it is a natural outgrowth of the deep divisions that characterize our nation\u2019s politics today. There is, sadly, a lot of truth in this. However, it must also be admitted that the actions of some who have an abiding love for the organization they serve, or served in, helped widen those rifts. They include, in the first instance, any CIA officers who, in the wake of the 2016 Presidential election, violated the law and their oaths to the Constitution by joining in what could only be described as a tsunami of leaks of classified or politically sensitive information as part of an attempt to \u2018resist\u2019 a President elected to office by a majority of American voters. </p><p>Further, one need only listen to half the country to understand that those serving and former officers who explicitly or implicitly cited their CIA affiliation \u2013 thereby implicitly indicating access to information unknown to the average citizen - in support of political causes contributed greatly to that perception of partisanship. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Subscriber+Members have exclusive access to the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">Open Source Collection Daily Brief</a>, keeping you up to date on global events impacting national security. It pays to be a <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\">Subscriber+Member</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Specific instances of this include lending support to the legitimacy of the since conclusively discredited \u201cSteele Dossier\u201d and, particularly, signing the open letter characterizing the \u2018Hunter Biden laptop\u2019 as having the hallmarks of a Russian information operation. Whatever personal views individual officers might hold on these and other politically contentious issues, there can be no doubt that many of our countrymen \u2013 not to mention many senior government officials - view the public statements of former CIA officers as the Agency putting its thumb on the political scale.</p><p>The organization has made clear this is not the case. But, as Henry Kissinger said, \u201cit is not a matter of what is true that counts, but a matter of what is perceived to be true.\u201d The question now is what CIA and Agency officers, past and present, can do to change that perception. A few steps come to mind.</p><p>First, CIA needs to reinforce its efforts to identify leakers and bring them to justice. As the Snowden case demonstrated, given the nature of modern technology and the speed with which information can be propagated, there is no difference in terms of the negative impact of their actions on U.S. national security between those who leak information and those spying for a foreign power. </p><p>Second, the time when former Director William J. Casey\u2019s expressed desire for a \u201cno-profile agency\u201d having long passed, CIA should re-double its public outreach efforts. Such programs will not, of course, quash the many conspiracy theories out there ranging from the serious (i.e., that CIA somehow had a hand in the JFK assassination) to the ridiculous (e.g., disproving the presence of the remains of space aliens being stored in the basement of the Original Headquarters Building). But the judicious release of historical information and the like does help educate the American people on what the Agency does in their name. </p><p>Finally, the Agency should remind former officers that they have life-long secrecy obligations but also reinforce the message that they remain representatives of CIA even after leaving the service in the eyes of their countrymen who, for the most part, do not distinguish between past and present Agency officers. Consequently, invoking their Agency experience in support of any endeavor that is clearly politically partisan can only damage the organization they served and make the already difficult jobs of those still serving harder still. And those are consequences to which no one who had the privilege and honor of serving at CIA wants to contribute.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><em>All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the US Government.

    "description": "<p>Two milestones revealed this week illustrate the diminishing power of <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90890314/tv-advertising-suffering-slow-death\">broadcast television</a> in the media world\u2014one fueled by the habits of young people and the other by their elders.<br /><br />During June, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91288106/youtube-tv-living-room-what-that-means-for-creators-and-viewers\">viewers</a> spent more time watching <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/streaming-services\">streaming services</a> than they did for broadcast and cable television combined. That happened for the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91354476/streaming-tv-viewership-now-outpaces-traditional-tv-for-the-first-time\">first time ever in May</a>, by a fraction of a percentage point, but the Nielsen company said on Tuesday that gap widened considerably in June.<br /><br />Also, for the third straight week, Nielsen said that Fox News Channel had more viewers in prime-time on weeknights than any of the main the broadcast networks ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox entertainment.<br /><br />For years, the mantra of media executives was that streaming represented the future for in-home entertainment. Now, that future has clearly arrived.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-broadcast-tv-slips-below-20-of-total\">Broadcast TV slips below 20% of total</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In June, 46% of Americans&#8217; TV time was spent on streaming services, led by <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91271138/youtube-most-innovative-companies-2025-neal-mohan-tv-nfl-content-creator-streaming\">YouTube</a> and Netflix. Cable television networks represented 23.4% and broadcast was 18.5%, for a total of just under 42%, Nielsen said. It was the first time broadcast TV had ever slipped below 20% of total TV viewing.<br /><br />&#8220;It kind of felt like the right time,&#8221; said Brian Fuhrer, Nielsen&#8217;s senior vice president for product strategy and thought leadership. &#8220;A lot of people thought it would happen more quickly.&#8221;<br /><br />The driving force in June was school ending for young people, meaning they had more time to watch TV, where Netflix series like &#8220;Ginny &amp; Georgia&#8221; and &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; were big hits. Roughly two-thirds of people aged 6 to 17 watched streaming ahead of conventional TV, Nielsen said.<br /><br />In June 2024, the numbers were roughly reversed\u201447.7% of people were watching conventional TV in an average minute, with 40.3% logged on to a streaming service.<br /><br />While the direction is clear, it&#8217;s not a death knell for conventional TV. June and July are fallow months, and their viewing will increase when football season begins and original episodes of comedies and dramas return, Fuhrer said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-content-is-distributed-over-more-platforms\">Content is distributed over more platforms</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also not a strict either-or situation; media companies are doing a better job spreading their content out on different platforms to give viewers a choice, he said. The growth of YouTube, which many consumers can access for free and is a portal for &#8220;traditional&#8221; TV, has also fueled streaming services.<br /><br />Fox News has occasionally eclipsed the broadcast networks in viewership before, but last week represented the seventh week it has done so in 2025, already more than 2024 and 2023 combined. It averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time on weeknights last week, Nielsen said.<br /><br />Fox News is also taking advantage of what is traditionally the least-watched time of the year for broadcast networks, when summer nights and barbecues keep people outside. The difference this year is it has won a few weeks outside of the summer, during President Donald Trump&#8217;s inauguration week in January, for example.<br /><br />Its audience\u2014among the oldest of all television networks\u2014tends to stay pretty steady throughout the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

    "description": "As the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 breaks attendance records in Switzerland, FRANCE 24's Perspective programme discusses a boost in support for the women's league and how it's covered in the media. A French broadcaster that was supposed to show a group stage match between France and the Netherlands on Sunday night decided to show the men's FIFA Club World Cup final between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea instead. For retired French footballer Laura Georges, the decision was disappointing. \"As the main broadcaster, you have to support your team,\" she says. Women's football \"has been evolving\", Georges adds, though it still needs \"more sponsors\" and \"leaders who believe in the game\".",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91318632/fed-chair-jerome-powells-termination-cannot-come-fast-enough-says-trump\">President Donald Trump</a> says he has finally found a way to achieve his goal of <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91242891/trump-reveals-2nd-terms-plan-fed-chair-jerome-powell\">removing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell</a>, accusing him of mismanaging the U.S. central bank&#8217;s $2.5 billion renovation project.<br /><br />The push comes after a monthslong campaign by Trump to try to rid himself of the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91319277/trump-wants-control-fed-investors-economists-prefer-stay-independent-heres-why\">politically independent central banker</a>, who has resisted the president&#8217;s calls to slash interest rates out of concerns about the administration&#8217;s tariffs sparking higher levels of inflation.<br /><br />The president indicated Tuesday that Powell&#8217;s handling of an extensive renovation project on two Fed buildings in Washington could be grounds to take the unprecedented and possibly legally dubious step of firing him. &#8220;I think it sort of is,&#8221; Trump said.<br /><br />&#8220;When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it&#8217;s really disgraceful,&#8221; Trump said, adding that he never saw the Fed chair as someone who needed a &#8220;palace.&#8221;<br /><br />The project has been underway for years, going back to Trump&#8217;s first term. But it only recently caught the White House&#8217;s attention. Trump maintains that Fed rate cuts would lower the costs of government borrowing, while Powell has warned that a premature rate cut could worsen inflation and ultimately raise those borrowing costs.<br /><br />The risk of the Fed losing its political independence could undermine America&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91321923/global-stocks-rise-trump-says-no-intention-firing-fed-chair\">financial markets</a>, possibly leading to a meltdown in stocks and investors charging a premium to lend to the U.S. economy.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s what to know:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ousting-powell-risks-setting-off-market-panic\">Ousting Powell risks setting off market panic</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fed chair <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91241083/trump-federal-reserve-jerome-powell-economy-inflation-interest-rates\">has been an obstacle</a> in Trump&#8217;s efforts to gain total control over the executive branch.<br /><br />Powell and his board have the dual mandate of maximizing employment and keeping prices stable, a task that can require them to make politically unpopular moves such as raising interest rates to hold inflation in check. The general theory is that keeping the Fed free from the influence of the White House\u2014other than for nominations of Fed officials\u2014allows it to fulfill its mission based on what the economy needs, instead of what a politician wants.<br /><br />An attempt to remove Powell from his job before his term ends in May 2026 would undercut the Fed&#8217;s long-standing independence from day-to-day politics and could lead to higher inflation, higher interest rates and a weaker economy.<br /><br />The Supreme Court recently signaled that the president can&#8217;t fire Powell simply because Trump disagrees with him on interest rates. But legally he could do so &#8220;for cause,&#8221; such as misconduct or dereliction of duty.<br /><br />Trump&#8217;s workaround appears to be that Powell misrepresented the renovation project in congressional testimony and that the cost is excessive, thus meriting his dismissal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-fed-s-main-headquarters-is-over-90-years-old\">The Fed&#8217;s main headquarters is over 90 years old</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fed says its main headquarters, known as the Marriner S. Eccles building, was in dire need of an upgrade because its electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems, among others, are nearly obsolete and some date back to the building&#8217;s construction in the 1930s.<br /><br />The renovation will also remove asbestos, lead and other hazardous elements and update the building with modern electrical and communications systems. The H-shaped building, named after a former Fed chair in the 1930s and &#8217;40s, is located near some of Washington&#8217;s highest-profile monuments and has references to classical architecture and marble in the facades and stonework. The central bank is also renovating a building next door that it acquired in 2018.<br /><br />The Fed says there has been periodic maintenance to the structures but adds that this is the first &#8220;comprehensive renovation.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-renovation-costs-have-ballooned-over-the-years\">The renovation costs have ballooned over the years</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump administration officials have criticized the Fed over the project&#8217;s expense, which has reached $2.5 billion, about $600 million more than was originally budgeted.<br /><br />Like a beleaguered homeowner facing spiraling costs for a remodeling project, the Fed cites many reasons for the greater expense. Construction costs, including for materials and labor, rose sharply during the inflation spike in 2021 and 2022. More asbestos needed to be removed than expected. Washington&#8217;s local restrictions on building heights forced it to build underground, which is pricier.<br /><br />In 2024, the Fed&#8217;s board canceled its planned renovations of a third building because of rising costs.<br /><br />The Fed says the renovations will reduce costs &#8220;over time&#8221; because it will be able to consolidate its roughly 3,000 Washington-based employees into fewer buildings and will no longer need to rent as much extra space as it does now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-white-house-budget-director-calls-renovations-ostentatious\">White House budget director calls renovations &#8216;ostentatious&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Russ Vought, the administration&#8217;s top budget adviser, wrote Powell a letter last Thursday that said Trump is &#8220;extremely troubled&#8221; about the Fed&#8217;s &#8220;ostentatious overhaul&#8221; of its facilities.<br /><br />The Fed&#8217;s renovation plans call for &#8220;rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more,&#8221; Vought said in his letter.<br /><br />Powell has disputed the claims, which were given wide circulation in a paper issued by the Mercatus Center, a think tank at George Mason University, in March 2025. The paper was written by Andrew Levin, an economist at Dartmouth College and former Fed staffer.<br /><br />&#8220;There&#8217;s no VIP dining room,&#8221; Powell said last month during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. &#8220;There&#8217;s no new marble. . . . There are no special elevators. There are no new water features. . . . And there&#8217;s no roof terrace gardens.&#8221;<br /><br />Some of those elements were removed from initial building plans submitted in 2021, the Fed says.<br /><br />But the White House also takes issue with the Fed reducing its renovation costs<br />The Fed&#8217;s changes to its building plans have opened it up to another line of attack: White House officials suggest the Fed violated the terms of the approval it received from a local planning commission by changing its plans.<br /><br />In its September 2021 approval of the project, the National Capital Planning Commission said it &#8220;Commends&#8221; the Fed for &#8220;fully engaging partner federal agencies.&#8221; But because the Fed changed its plans, the administration is indicating it needed to go back to the commission for a separate approval.<br /><br />Essentially, White House officials are saying Powell is being reckless with taxpayer money because of the cost of the renovation, but they are also accusing him of acting unethically by scaling back the project to save money.<br /><br />James Blair, the White House deputy chief of staff whom Trump named to the commission, said last Thursday in a post on X that Powell&#8217;s June congressional testimony &#8220;leads me to conclude the project is not in alignment with plans submitted to &amp; approved by the National Capital Planning Commission in 2021.&#8221;<br /><br />Speaking last Thursday at the planning commission meeting, Blair said he intends to tour the construction site, review materials from the Fed on how the approved 2021 renovation plans have changed and circulate a letter among his colleagues on the commission that would go to Fed officials.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-fed-has-asked-for-an-independent-review-of-the-project\">The Fed has asked for an independent review of the project</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The central bank says, in a series of frequently asked questions on its website, that it is &#8220;not subject to the direction&#8221; of the commission and has only complied with its directives voluntarily.<br /><br />Instead, the Fed said it is accountable to the Senate and House of Representatives, and is also overseen by an independent inspector general, not the White House. Powell has asked the inspector general to review the costs of the renovation project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u2014Christopher Rugaber and Josh Boak, Associated Press</em></p>",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91369028/asml-stock-price-today-critical-warning-about-2026-tanks-shares",
    "description": "<p>One of the most critical companies in the chipmaking industry is seeing its stock price drop precipitously today. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dutch semiconductor company ASML Holding N.V. (Nasdaq: ASML) reported its second-quarter 2025 results, beating on its most critical metrics, but its stock price is still declining in premarket trading. The reason? Executives made comments about its upcoming 2026 fiscal year that have investors concerned. Here\u2019s what you need to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-most-important-non-chip-company-in-the-chip-industry\">The most important non-chip company in the chip industry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ASML Holding N.V. is headquartered in Veldhoven, Netherlands, and is arguably the most important technology company within Europe\u2019s borders. Given that ASML is critical to the world\u2019s chipmaking supply chain, the company is also one of the most important tech giants in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ASML is not a chipmaker itself. However, it produced the machines that make the chips inside your devices. These machines are known as <a href=\"https://www.asml.com/en/products/euv-lithography-systems\">extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) photolithography machines</a>, and they use light to etch patterns into the silicon wafers used in chipmaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the world has several photolithography machine companies, ASML is the world\u2019s only maker of EUV photolithography machines. EUV technology is critical in the world\u2019s most advanced chips, including those made by Apple for its Apple Silicon chips and the chips produced by Nvidia, which are crucial for <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">artificial intelligence</a> servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ASML\u2019s customers include Nvidia and TSMC, the maker of Apple\u2019s chips. The Dutch company sells its EUV machines to these companies, enabling them to produce their own chips. As <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/asml-q2-2025-earnings-report.html\">noted</a> by CNBC, ASML\u2019s most advanced photolithography machines can be the size of a double-decker bus and cost as much as $400 million each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without ASML\u2019s machines, the world&#8217;s semiconductor manufacturing capability grinds to a halt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-asml-beats-but-2026-comments-worry-investors\">ASML beats, but 2026 comments worry investors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence, chipmakers are pumping out more advanced chips than ever\u2014chips that require the EUV photolithography machines that ASML offers. Given that, it\u2019s little surprise that ASML exceeded investor expectations in its most recent financial quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the company <a href=\"https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2025/q2-2025-financial-results\">announced</a> its Q2 2025 results, in which it reported:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\u20ac7.7 billion (about $8.9 billion) in net sales&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u20ac2.3 billion (about $2.6 billion) in net income</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gross margin of 53.7%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Earnings per share of \u20ac5.90 (about $6.85)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To put those net sales and net income figures into greater perspective, CNBC notes that analysts were expecting net sales of \u20ac7.52 billion (about $8.7 billion) and net income of \u20ac2.04 billion (about $2.3 billion). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, ASML handily beat expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company also reported net bookings\u2014a metric that indicates customer demand\u2014of \u20ac5.5 billion (about $6.3 billion), of which \u20ac2.3 billion (about $2.6 billion) is for its most advanced EUV photolithography machines. Analysts had been expecting net bookings of \u20ac4.19 billion (about $4.8 billion).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-is-asml-stock-falling\">Why is ASML stock falling?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>However, despite the welcomed Q2 results, ASML\u2019s stock price has plunged in premarket trading after the company announced its latest financials. That fall has to do with two main factors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, ASML\u2019s Q3 forecast disappointed investors. The company said it expects to post total net sales of between \u20ac7.4 billion (about $8.6 billion) and \u20ac7.9 billion. It also expects its gross margin to be between 50% and 52% for the period. The company also said it expects its full fiscal 2025 total net sales to equate to an increase of 15%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As noted by CNBC, analysts had been expecting Q3 net sales to be around \u20ac8.3 billion (about $9.1 billion). ASML\u2019s 15% growth forecast for full-year sales was also lower than what it had previously forecast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the second factor may be the primary reason for ASML&#8217;s share price decline this morning\u2014comments made by ASML executives regarding its 2026 outlook.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Announcing its Q2 results, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet touched on expectations for 2026.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLooking at 2026, we see that our AI customers&#8217; fundamentals remain strong,\u201d Fouquet said. \u201cAt the same time, we continue to see increasing uncertainty driven by macro-economic and geopolitical developments. Therefore, while we still prepare for growth in 2026, we cannot confirm it at this stage.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, ASML\u2019s CEO is admitting he does not know if the company will grow in 2026. His comments suggest that the main uncertainty surrounding its growth potential are related to President Trump\u2019s tariffs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ASML is a foreign company that sells a significant amount to American companies, yet it does not have widespread operations in America, making it a potential target for retaliation from Trump and his goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fouquet did not say there would <em>not</em> be growth, but given the tariff uncertainty, he seems to feel it&#8217;s more prudent to prepare investors for that possibility.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that\u2019s a cautionary message investors have not taken well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of the time of this writing, ASML shares are down over 7% in premarket trading to $764 per share. Yesterday, shares had closed above $823. As of yesterday\u2019s close, ASML shares were up over 18% since the beginning of the year.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Stage fright is not a term you\u2019d associate with Elvis Presley, but in 1968 he was all shook up\u2014with nerves. Ahead of his <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/elvis-presley-comeback-special-1968-50th-anniversary?srsltid=AfmBOorKAUE9ZOGB9ac7xzKd0SM-MgT5FdRP1CS_5YqcPkmY4Aq1DgE7\">make-or-break \u201ccomeback special\u201d</a> after years floundering in Hollywood, the King had cold feet. He told the special\u2019s director, Steve Binder, he was \u201cterrified,\u201d adding, &#8220;I don\u2019t know if I can do this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just me and a guitar in front of people?&#8221; He half-joked to his entourage about retreating to Hawaii.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from a few close confidants, no one has ever witnessed these intimate moments of reservation. But starting July 17 in London, guests at <a href=\"https://elvisevolution.com/\"><em>Elvis Evolution</em></a> will see an <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a>-generated Elvis play out these fears, and other key moments of his life. The immersive event will be powered by various types of tech, but the creators want to ensure that none of them get in the way of the magic of being transported back in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Layered Reality puts on experiential events comprising three \u201clayers\u201d: tech, theater, and physical elements. The tech is multifaceted, from augmented reality to 3D audio effects; the theater comprises traditional sets and live actors; the physical elements are sensory stimulants like touch and taste. \u201cThat\u2019s a really intoxicating combination,\u201d says founder and CEO Andrew McGuinness. \u201cOften they&#8217;re kept in separate worlds. We firmly believe they belong together.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has deployed this mix of elements for Londoners three times before, including in retellings of <em>War of the Worlds</em>, and <em>The Gunpowder Plot</em>, hosted in the eerie vaults below the Tower of London. The new endeavor is far from a 17th-century plot against a king\u2014though, this one also has a king, or rather, <em>the</em> King.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91368566\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/1-91368335-elvis-evolution-is-an-immersive-ai-powered-experience-in-london-that-brings-elvis-presleys-life-and-legacy-to-life-through-tech-theater-and-sensory-effects.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Elvis records the soundtrack to <em>Love Me Tender</em> in a Los Angeles studio in August 1956.

At times, walls and sets will move around them. They\u2019ll take on different points of view. \u201cYou are literally going to walk in his shoes at one point,\u201d says Simon Reveley, head of studios, not indicating if those shoes are blue suede.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91368551\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-2-91368335-elvis-evolution-is-an-immersive-ai-powered-experience-in-london-that-brings-elvis-presleys-life-and-legacy-to-life-through-tech-theater-and-sensory-effects.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Image: Courtesy of Layered Reality]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Different scenes will employ different tech tactics. \u201cWe are very deliberately technology agnostic,\u201d McGuinness says, stressing that tech is simply a \u201ctool\u201d to enhance the experience. \u201cWhen it&#8217;s at its best, the technology gets out of the way.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In past Layered Reality shows, tech ranged from subtle to sensory: in one scene in <em>The Gunpowder Plot</em>, for example, guests hide in pitch dark from priest hunters, with spatial audio and LED floor lights simulating creeping footsteps; in another, a VR-enhanced boat ride layers motion effects with water sprays, cool air, and the salty scent of the sea\u2014blending physical cues with digital immersion to trick the brain into believing the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91368554\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-1-91368335-elvis-evolution-is-an-immersive-ai-powered-experience-in-london-that-brings-elvis-presleys-life-and-legacy-to-life-through-tech-theater-and-sensory-effects.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Image: Courtesy of Layered Reality]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For Elvis, they don\u2019t want to give away too much to ruin the element of surprise. Of course, music will be central. Through it all, artificial intelligence helps to remaster sounds, and upscale footage quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-elvis\">\u201cAI Elvis\u201d</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But AI\u2019s starring role is in \u201cAI Elvis\u201d himself. Guests will come face to face with the recreation of Presley. Layered Reality trained the AI on hours and hours of footage, feeding an algorithm concert clips, Cine 8 films, and thousands of photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI Elvis has been done before in 2022, on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr8yEgu7sHU\"><em>America\u2019s Got Talent</em></a>. An actor served as Elvis\u2019 deepfake double, creating movements to make it look as if Presley were performing \u201cDevil in Disguise\u201d (with a deepfake Simon Cowell).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reveley explains that with more advanced facial generative AI, you can now tune the algorithm to lean more into the original source material than the human actor. AI can pick up on minute nuances, vital for someone whose expressions, like the lip curl, were so iconic. \u201cWe all know them so well, and so does the machine learning algorithm,\u201d Reveley says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the purpose of AI Elvis is to \u201cunearth\u201d footage that happened but wasn\u2019t captured\u2014like the nerves before the \u201968 TV special.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ethics-and-delays\">Ethics and delays</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recreating imagined scenes raises ethical questions, of whether a person no longer living would want to share their most intimate moments with the world. But the team insists its project is different from the Simon Cowell duet\u2014or the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/07/16/1016838440/ai-brought-anthony-bourdains-voice-back-to-life-should-it-have\">AI Anthony Bourdain</a> that was controversially made to narrate part of a documentary\u2014because they aren\u2019t fabricating something that never happened. \u201cAI [is] being a digital archivist rather than an originator,\u201d McGuinness says. The Presley estate is also heavily involved, and granted the team access to all the footage. (The Presley estate did not respond to <em>Fast Company</em>\u2019s request for comment.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91368582\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/2-91368335-elvis-evolution-is-an-immersive-ai-powered-experience-in-london-that-brings-elvis-presleys-life-and-legacy-to-life-through-tech-theater-and-sensory-effects.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Still image from <em>Singer Presents ELVIS</em>, known as the King\u2019s 1968 \u201ccomeback special.\u201d [Photo: Courtesy of courtesy of Elvis Presley Enterprises, LLC/Layered Reality]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To create AI Elvis, Layered Reality partnered with the Mill, a visual effects agency that won an Oscar for bringing Oliver Reed back to life in <em>Gladiator. </em>The Mill was a subsidiary of the postproduction giant Technicolor Group, which since 1915 set the industry standard for color entertainment. But in February, after years of financial struggles, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/artisans/global/technicolor-collapse-shockwaves-vfx-1236326607/\">Technicolor went bust.</a> (<em>Fast Company</em> reached out to the Mill to confirm it was also affected, but didn\u2019t hear back.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That caused delays; though Layered Reality had ownership of AI Elvis, it had work to finish. They scrambled to <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/hiring\" title=\"Hiring\">hire</a> artists from The Mill on contract to complete the final phases. They pushed back the start date twice, from the original planned date of March.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-post-pandemic-events-boom\">A post-pandemic events boom</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s now on course to welcome guests, to experience what McGuinness views as part of a \u201clive entertainment revolution.\u201d It views its competitors not as other tech or AI companies, but anything else you could be doing that night, from a musical, to mini golf, to \u201cthat Italian restaurant on the corner of your street [where] you\u2019ll end up spending 130 pounds.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that comparison, McGuinness thinks 75 pounds ($102) for a standard ticket is fair. \u201cWe\u2019re in the memory business, [and] too much of our money is still spent on immemorable things,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The business banks on a rising demand for these types of events. The term \u201cexperience economy\u201d has existed since 1998, when it appeared in <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, but COVID-19 accelerated the allure, boosting the popularity of experiences like Cosm in Los Angeles and the Sphere in Las Vegas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that backdrop, Elvis Evolution hopes it can usher in a modern-day comeback. Of course, the \u201868 one turned out to be a tour de force, full of raw vocals and black leather. Nerves dissipated, and gave way to humor. &#8220;I sang to turtles and palm trees for years,\u201d Elvis told the audience about his movie career. \u201cThis is a lot better, don\u2019t you think?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<hr />",

Gluck <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91358941/navigating-the-unknown-jon-gluck-on-his-cancer-journey-and-embracing-uncertainty\">joined</a> the <em>Most Innovative Companies</em> podcast to discuss getting diagnosed, how working helped him cope with his illness, and the workplace accommodations that enabled him to keep going.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-medium\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91362498\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_300,h_300/wp-cms-2/2025/07/an-exercise-in-uncertainty.jpg\" width=\"300\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your book follows your journey with a rare type of blood cancer. What is the condition?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a blood cancer alternately referred to as a bone marrow cancer called multiple myeloma. It&#8217;s an incurable cancer but one that has fortunately, in my case, been treatable. I will never not have it, but fortunately I&#8217;ve been in a position where my doctors have been able to manage and control it quite nicely. There have been times when I&#8217;ve been very sick and then I&#8217;m treated and I go into a remission and then I&#8217;m sick again and I go into a remission. That&#8217;s been the story of the last 20 years. A portion of my book proceeds are going toward multiple myeloma research.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In the book, you mention that the first person you called after your initial diagnosis\u2014when you were given less than two years to live\u2014was your boss. Why?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I was trying to create a sense of normalcy for myself. I think part of it was denial. I just didn&#8217;t want to really admit that anything was so wrong that I had to do anything differently than I normally would. Part of it was just the strange sense of duty&nbsp;I have sometimes as an individual. I was like, well, I better report to the boss that I won&#8217;t be there today, even though I&#8217;ve just received life-changing information. It\u2019s very Boy Scout behavior. I was also avoiding calling people for whom it would be a much bigger deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You write that you encounter three types of responses when you disclose your cancer diagnosis. Some say they know someone who died from the same condition. Others immediately try to help and find solutions. Then there\u2019s a third type who just listens to you and is empathetic. What advice do you have for people whose friends or relatives share a diagnosis with them?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a tricky thing. Most everybody is well intentioned, and so whatever people say or do I understand. That said, I&#8217;m going to give a \u201cnever, sometimes, always\u201d answer to your three buckets. So the never is, \u201cBoy, I just knew somebody who had that and they died yesterday.\u201d I think it&#8217;s pretty unhelpful. Probably the person who just told you they&#8217;ve been diagnosed with the same disease is not the best person to talk to about that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I think wanting to help is complicated. The criteria I&#8217;d use there after 20 years of dealing with this is .\u00a0.\u00a0. are you offering something that&#8217;s genuinely helpful and that the person probably hasn&#8217;t already heard? If you are, then go for it. I think there&#8217;ve been people I know who said, \u201cListen, I happen to know my wife&#8217;s uncle is really close friends with an amazing myeloma doctor at such and such a hospital. If you ever want to reach out to them, I can put you in touch.\u201d That&#8217;s helpful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the always category of basic empathy or sympathy. I&#8217;ve been really struck over the years by how powerful just somebody simply saying, \u201cI&#8217;m really sorry to hear that\u201d [can be]. Honest to God, those words alone are wonderful and more powerful than you think they are. One of the first people I told in my office, a colleague I remember very vividly simply said, \u201cYou poor guy. I am really sorry.\u201d That was so moving and it wasn&#8217;t even someone I was particularly close with. It was just somebody who knew the right thing to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>While many people, when they get a diagnosis like this, rethink their whole lives, you looked back on your life and realized you were pretty happy with your job and your situation. How has work helped you throughout your illness?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been working this whole time. I&#8217;ve hardly missed a day of work, even when I&#8217;ve been hospitalized, [thanks to] remote work and Zoom. Sometimes people say, \u201cThat&#8217;s so brave or courageous or wonderful of you to have worked the whole time.\u201d Believe me, it has nothing to do with bravery in my case, it\u2019s just an incredibly great distraction. The pressure and deadlines we deal with in our business were great for me because it was like whatever the problem is here at work, it&#8217;s not as big as that [cancer] problem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>People often talk about getting that kind of perspective when they&#8217;ve received a diagnosis like mine. That&#8217;s absolutely been true in my case. I really came to see that I love what I do, and so there was just pleasure and enjoyment in doing the work. When you&#8217;re sick and not feeling well all the time or getting treatment and feeling even worse, pleasure and enjoyment are in short supply.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can still get burned out though. You wrote about leaving </strong><strong><em>New York </em></strong><strong>magazine after a while because you needed a break.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I happened to be working at a place that was extremely demanding and I had been there for more than 10 years. As my disease became more complicated and my treatment became more aggressive and the side effects therefore were more debilitating, many people said to me, \u201cDo you really want to work this hard? Stress is bad for you.\u201d I was like, well, stress is bad for you if it&#8217;s bad stress or if it&#8217;s an excessive level of stress, but as I was saying a minute ago, a certain amount of stress I found really good in the sense that it kept my mind off of my illness. But that reached a tipping point somewhere in my 10th year of working. I realized I need a job that&#8217;s not so demanding minute to minute, day to day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There are constant layoffs in the media industry, which can be stressful when your medical insurance is tied to your job. What kind of insurance battles have you had?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve become an unwilling example of this new category of people I call cancer zombies. And what I mean by that is people who are half sick and half well. There\u2019s a growing number of us because of the advancements in biomedical research and the treatments for many kinds of cancers. Instead of either you&#8217;re treated and you survive and you&#8217;re good to go for the rest of your life, or you&#8217;re treated and unfortunately the treatments don&#8217;t work and you pass away, there&#8217;s this whole cohort of us who are living for really long periods of time with varying degrees of illness and debilitation. Unless you&#8217;re independently wealthy, that means you need to work for a lot of years and you need insurance for a lot of years, even while you&#8217;re struggling with your illness and your treatments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I learned that the leading cause of personal bankruptcy is unexpected medical expenses. Because of all that [my wife and I] felt like we really needed a sort of belt-and-suspenders approach, and for both of us to have insurance in case either of us got laid off because we were both in the media business and layoffs had been happening\u00a0 for many years at an alarming rate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of dealing with insurance companies, it&#8217;s maddening. The system is so broken that what it comes down to is just getting lucky. What I mean by that is getting somebody on the other end of the phone who&#8217;s a human being, not a machine, and who actually cares and wants to help solve your problem. Whether that happens or not is just a crapshoot. You just have to keep going at it.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What was the pandemic like for you?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was tough. Part of both my illness and my treatment have left me quite immunocompromised. We were in the city and we had no other logical place to go. We didn&#8217;t want to move in with family and expose them to extra risk. We followed all the precautions to a T. But then oddly enough, we went back to living the way most people were living. At some point I just decided, what&#8217;s the point of staying alive if you don&#8217;t live your life? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the interesting things that happened toward the end of the first, most serious wave of the pandemic is that I wrote an op-ed for <em>The Washington Post</em>. The title was something like, \u201cIt&#8217;s great that everybody&#8217;s getting back to normal. Now, please keep in mind that there are some of us who are immunocompromised who still need to take these precautions.\u201d Most of the comments I got were lovely and supportive, but [it was also] met [negatively] by some people. One of the comments I think was, \u201cThat&#8217;s the luck of the draw. We don&#8217;t owe you anything, stop whining.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How important are accommodations, like the ability to work remotely, for you?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been tremendously important. One of the other things that is interesting about the pandemic is that in some ways, people sort of sympathize more with everybody who has ever been through [illness] and has to worry constantly about germs. That was normalizing in a strange way. The best part was being able to work remotely. It allowed me to keep my job without going on disability. It allowed me to keep the constant distraction of working in place so that I didn&#8217;t lose my mind. It became a lifeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have you experienced any workplace discrimination?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a really tricky question. I&#8217;m not the kind of person to knee-jerk see that sort of thing everywhere, but I&#8217;ve had glimpses of it. When I was getting ready to leave <em>New York</em> magazine and interviewing for jobs at other places, a recruiter said to me, \u201cI read the story you wrote [about your illness] in <em>New York</em> magazine. How are you doing?\u201d On the one hand, she seemed like an extremely nice person and I&#8217;m the kind of person who&#8217;s inclined to give people the benefit of the doubt. On the other hand, I wondered, <em>Is she fishing for information about my health status so she can figure out if I\u2019m a wise <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/hiring\" title=\"Hiring\">hire</a>?</em> I&#8217;ll never know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not here to give people advice [about] whether or not they should share information about their illness. I will say once you do decide to, there&#8217;s no putting it back in the bottle. So just be super sure that if you want to share this information, you are potentially opening yourself up to what can be a very serious problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91362500\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-91362466-jon-gluck-an-exercise-in-uncertainty-fast-company-QA.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Oscar Gluck]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n<hr />",

Was it supposed to be a crossword puzzle? A disco ball? A badminton racquet? A screen door replete with dead houseflies?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"The logo of TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), featuring the lowercase red text 'tsmc' over a circular grid pattern with scattered black squares. A horizontal red line runs beneath the text.\" class=\"wp-image-91366950\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-0-91366665-tsmc-logo-b2b-brands.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Image: TSMC]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, the logo, which debuted in 1988, one year after the company\u2019s founding, represents \u201ca stylized semiconductor wafer design,\u201d as a TSMC<a href=\"https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=98778484&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> trademark application</a> puts it. A wafer is a thin, circular slice of silicon which is cut into rectangular \u201cdies\u201d that are used to make computer chips. The flat section of the wafer, visible at the bottom of the TSMC logo, is called, well, a \u201cflat\u201d and is used for orientation in the manufacturing process.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\n&quot;A collage of eight logos related to technology or engineering: 1) A circle with a grid pattern and an integral symbol (\u222bdt); 2) A circle with a grid pattern and the letters 'IDT'; 3) A circular emblem labeled 'SILICON VALLEY ENGINEERING COUNCIL' with '1989' at the bottom; 4) A half-circle filled with black and three horizontal white stripes below; 5) An oval formed by horizontal lines with 'CIRRUS LOGIC' next to it; 6) The word 'ZORAN' in striped letters with a grid-patterned circle in one letter; 7) An outline of Texas filled with grid patterns inside an oval, labeled 'SemiTex'; 8) A circle filled with a grid of squares and the word 'RMOSIS'.&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-91366951\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-2-91366665-tsmc-logo-b2b-brands.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">1st column: Integrated Device Technology, 1982, Wacker MSCE, 1986. 2nd column: Integrated Device Technology, 1998, Zoran Corporation, 1983, Cirrus Logic, 1996.

One might find this an odd design element to include, but it appears to have been a bit of a convention among &#8217;80s wafer logos. San Jose semiconductor maker Integrated Device Technology\u2019s 1981 logo featured two such defective dies. When it reversed the coloring of its logo in the &#8217;90s, did it realize the resulting implication was that an overwhelming majority of its dies were duds?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Two logos side by side, each displaying the lowercase text 'tsmc' over a circular grid pattern composed of black and white squares.

Otherwise, though, the logo has remained unchanged and, frankly, it doesn\u2019t work well in 2025. Not only is the wafer symbolism inscrutable to the modern eye, but by today\u2019s standards, its design is overwrought, amateurish, and dated, in keeping with an overall company brand that\u2019s as dry as soda crackers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond employing the most obvious graphic design solution of adopting the company\u2019s product as a logo, the firm has named itself using the largely-abandoned tactic of simple descriptiveness, which, if still in vogue, might have resulted in Apple being known as the Northern California Computer Company or Amazon going by Seattle Online Bookstore, Inc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until recently, this may not have been seen as a problem for companies that, like TSMC, were not public-facing. There was a sense that <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/branding\" title=\"Branding\">branding</a> elements like names and logos were shiny baubles that served only to catch the eyes of the public, and that were irrelevant within the context of B2B relationships. As economic historian Mira Wilkins put it in a<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00076799200000004\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 1992 paper</a>, \u201cMost industrial organization economists consider the brand name as highly important in sales to the final consumer. They take the view, however, that profit-motivated firms are wiser than individuals, so trade marks are not needed to convey information to producers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such thinking is going by the wayside as modern economists let go of long-held assumptions about perfect human rationality, and it would seem time for even the stodgiest B2B companies to start caring more about their brands. TSMC, in particular, has been<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91290187/does-donald-trumps-tsmc-deal-mean-taiwan-just-lost-its-silicon-valley-shield\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> embroiled</a> in geopolitical intrigue that has put it in an unprecedented spotlight. The face that it presents to the world matters more than it ever has, and it\u2019s about time for TSMC to sunset its old wafer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

    "description": "<p>Earlier this summer, Pepsi did something brands have been doing forever: It took a jab at its rival. In this case, that entailed some snarky <a href=\"https://www.marketingdive.com/news/pepsi-parodies-share-a-coke-after-rival-resurrects-iconic-campaign/750553/\">satirizing</a> of a popular Coke ad campaign. But it raised an eternal brand-battle question: Is it really a good idea to reference a rival so directly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the right circumstances, yes, according to the latest research on that subject in a recent <em>Journal of <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">Marketing</a> Research </em>paper, coauthored by Johannes Berendt, a professor of economics and communication at Hannover University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Germany. His fellow co-authors are Sebastian Uhrich, a professor of sports business administration at the German Sport University Cologne; Abhishek Borah, an associate professor of marketing at INSEAD (Institut Europ\u00e9en d&#8217;Administration des Affaires) in France; and Gavin Kilduff, a professor of management and organizations at NYU Stern.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, Berendt explains in an email, it\u2019s important to distinguish between true rivalry and mere competition: Real rivals not only compete against each other in the marketplace, but they also have a \u201cspecial competitive relationship based on a shared history,\u201d he says. This includes McDonald\u2019s vs. Burger King, Mercedes vs. BMW, Apple vs. Samsung, and, of course, Coke vs. Pepsi. Researchers call it the \u201c<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00222437241248414\">rivalry reference effect</a>.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cConsumers know that this is more than just regular competition,\u201d Berendt says. In their studies (which included analyses of 1.5 million social media posts from real brands, as well as controlled experiments involving fictional posts in various brand categories), Berendt and his fellow researchers found that a brand message referencing a rival increases consumer engagement\u2014and can even impact purchase intent. <br /><br />\u201cOpenly contested rivalries have a special appeal,\u201d Berendt adds. \u201cMessages between rivals are processed differently than between ordinary competitors.\u201d (Remember the chicken sandwich wars a couple of years back? It made sense that Popeye\u2019s and Chick-fil-A would scrap on social media, but it felt off<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wendys-enters-popeyes-chick-fil-a-chicken-sandwich-battle-2019-8\"> when Wendy\u2019s butted in</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pepsi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.adsoftheworld.com/campaigns/share-a-pepsi\">recent shot at its longtime nemesis\u2019s \u201cShare a Coke\u201d campaign</a> is a good example of a fresh salvo between true rivals. The Coke campaign, a Gen Z-focused iteration of a past effect, involves limited-edition packaging printed with individual names like \u201cDavid\u201d or \u201cMia.\u201d Pepsi copied the style but smirked at the sentiment on packaging and billboards, replacing names with shout-outs to burgers, wings, and other Pepsi-friendly grub pairings. Share a Pepsi with, say, pizza, \u201cnot some bro,\u201d goes one example, resonating with the soda\u2019s \u201cFood Deserves Pepsi\u201d pitch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the specifics of any single critique may matter less than its context within a clearly established rivalry. \u201cBetween rivals, consumers instantly connect new episodes to a familiar, ongoing narrative,\u201d Berendt says. \u201cThis is because rivalry has two central elements of exciting stories: familiar antagonists, such as Coke and Pepsi, and a classic plot, the recurring conflict.\u201d For a consumer who has long since chosen sides, the message can be reinforcing, but Berendt says even \u201cneutral\u201d consumers seem to enjoy, or engage with, known rivalries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are limits. While deploying brand rivalry messages can play to feelings of consumer-group distinctiveness, it might risk implying an overly aggressive brand personality. But that\u2019s generally not an issue \u201cif a rival is attacked in a clever/humorous way,\u201d Berendt says. A few years ago, for instance, Burger King took a jab at McDonald\u2019s with its \u201c<a href=\"https://oohtoday.com/every-king-needs-a-clown/\">Every King Needs a Clown</a>\u201d campaign in Germany. Occasionally, a rival-focused message can even take the high road, as when Mercedes&#8217; CEO retired and BMW launched<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rx7-ec0p0A\"> a spot</a> thanking him for years of \u201cinspiring competition.\u201d The ad got 8.2 million views and lots of positive comments on YouTube, Berendt points out, suggesting that \u201cthis was a classy way to engage with the rival.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, the rivalry reference effect works whether it\u2019s the category leader or the chief challenger calling out its brand enemy. The dynamic seems to be similar either way, playing to longtime loyalties or just widespread familiarity with a competitive history. It\u2019s true, Berendt concedes, that social media teasing can escalate if fans get involved and go after each other\u2014particularly in the context of sports. And sometimes a badly executed attack on a rival can just seem childish. But based on what Berendt and his colleagues found, there\u2019s not as much risk as you might think. \u201cIf done in a clever way, most consumers seem to enjoy a good clash between rivals once in a while,\u201d he says.</p>",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91367750/how-to-banish-toxic-positivity-at-work",
    "description": "<p>Sure, we know that feelings are highly contagious, and being positive can help others around us to feel the same, but let\u2019s be honest for a moment: sometimes life isn\u2019t all rainbows. Some days aren\u2019t great, and sometimes positivity isn\u2019t the best way to handle it. And research confirms it: one 10-year <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3035563/\">study</a> into using avoidance to cope\u2014perhaps by pretending things are fine, rather than addressing when they aren\u2019t\u2014 finds that it can\u00a0increase chronic, acute stress and be linked to long-term depressive symptoms.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience as an emotional intelligence and human behavior specialist, our workplaces are becoming more focused on employee wellbeing, but it\u2019s an easy way to compel us to fake optimism, regardless of the real circumstances at hand. In workplace cultures, toxic positivity compels people to remain optimistic or think positively regardless of the real circumstances\u2014say, key clients lost, budgets and bonuses frozens, or team-wide layoffs. And it\u2019s pervasive: one survey by workplace blog <a href=\"https://www.scienceofpeople.com/toxic-positivity/\">Science of People</a> finds\u00a0that almost 68% of people had experienced toxic positivity in the last week.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fundamental basics of relationships between people is based on the ability to trust. Trust is created through being honest and transparent, being accountable and creditable, and being empathetic and vulnerable. It takes being real\u2014and fake positivity isn\u2019t real. If I can see that your optimism is a put-on, how can I trust the other things you say or do? Do I feel safe to be real, or do I, too, need to fake positivity?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this occurs, it impacts every part of our workplace\u2014from our culture, to our performance and our mental health. Ultimately it impacts the overall success of each person and in turn, their organization. Here are five steps to shut down toxic positivity in a workplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Own the reality of the situation. </strong>The world is not perfect; we are not perfect. Things will go wrong, and we will get it wrong at times. The only thing we have control over in this world is how we choose to respond\u2014and our response should be authentic and genuine. Respond appropriately to the workplace situation, at the right intensity, without the need for forced toxic positivity.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Face emotions head-on. </strong>There is no such thing as a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d emotion, and while we tend to think positivity is the former,\u00a0that isn\u2019t the case. We should be focusing on whether an emotion is appropriate for the situation, and whether the intensity that we are feeling the emotion is appropriate. We feel emotions for a reason. Acknowledge and understand what is driving an emotion so that it can be processed before we move on.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Understand how the people around us are feeling. </strong>Our emotions are influential to the people around us, but people can spot an insincere emotion from far away. Faking an emotion is setting a standard in workplace environments of what is acceptable and what is not. Trust and respect won\u2019t be created when people are not being authentic or genuine.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ask the right questions, and answer questions asked. </strong>Communication is always key to the workplace environment, and the ability to communicate effectively directly influences our culture. When we are feeling any form of intensive emotion, we have something to say. Ask the right questions to better understand what is driving another person\u2019s emotions. Answer the questions they have, and provide the information they require to be able to move forward.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Drive emotional intelligence. </strong>Realistically, we know that a great culture in a workplace is when all emotions are being displayed appropriately. In some situations, it may be optimism\u2014and other times it might be sadness, anger, disappointment, fear, or frustration. Let\u2019s not judge someone else\u2019s emotion. Assess it, and do what it takes to ensure they are felt and processed before moving forward.\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe standard you walk past is the standard you accept,\u201d Australian Lieutenant General David Morrison once said. Every person contributes to the culture of a workplace. By facing toxic positivity and choosing more effective communication, you can change yours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

Some of its practices are low tech, such as using crop rotation to improve soil health, or letting wildflowers grow on the edge of fields to support pollinators. But it also continuously incorporates new technologies like sensors and drones.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91368680\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/01-91367934-james-dyson-vertical-farming.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Dyson Farming]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At a farm in Carrington, England, the company started using an anaerobic digester to turn manure into electricity nearly a decade ago.

The process also generates a lot of heat, which is why the farm initially added a greenhouse: The strawberries can make use of the heat to grow in cooler weather. But the team recognized that they could go farther.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91368685\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/04-91367934-james-dyson-vertical-farming.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Dyson Farming]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs engineers, we\u2019re never satisfied,\u201d Dyson says. \u201cWe constantly ask how things can be improved, achieving better results with the same resources. Instead of relying on traditional rows, we have designed and built a system in which strawberry plants are arranged on rotating wheels which are over 5 meters high, fully utilizing the glasshouse\u2019s vertical space. This dramatically increases the number of plants we can grow in the same footprint, significantly boosting yields by 250%.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91368687\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/22-91367934-james-dyson-vertical-farming.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Dyson Farming]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In a typical vertical farm, plants sit on shelves or on walls under artificial light. On the Dyson farm, as the Ferris-wheel-like design rotates, the strawberries get as much access as possible to natural light under the roof of the greenhouse. The farm supplements this with LED bulbs. (A sensor detects the wavelengths of light that the strawberry plants need, and then adds more as necessary.) Making better use of sunlight means that the mechanism also uses less energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91368691\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/03-91367934-james-dyson-vertical-farming.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Dyson Farming]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The system is automated, with robots that use vision sensing to pick berries when they\u2019re perfectly ripe. Other robots distribute predatory insects to fight aphids without insecticide. Another robotic system shines UV light on the berries to prevent mold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the system is still in the early stages, the first crop of strawberries was harvested in May and June, and sold at a premium in U.K. grocery stores because of the quality of the fruit. Eventually, the new tech will be growing strawberries year-round. \u201cApart from during a few weeks in the summer, the strawberries available in British supermarkets will have been trucked over from North Africa or Spain,\u201d Dyson says. \u201cThere is a significant carbon footprint associated with that movement. Plus, the strawberries themselves are small, colorless, and not at all sweet. Our crop is the opposite of that.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91368694\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/16-91367934-james-dyson-vertical-farming.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Dyson Farming]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of Dyson Farming\u2019s food is still grown outside. But there are advantages to growing indoors when it\u2019s possible, especially as the climate changes. While some other <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90824702/vertical-farming-failing-profitable-appharvest-aerofarms-bowery\">vertical farms have struggled with cost</a>, it\u2019s possible that Dyson\u2019s efficient new invention could help, particularly its model of generating electricity and heat from farm waste on-site. Right now, the biggest cost for vertical farming comes from energy use.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91368697\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/07-91367934-james-dyson-vertical-farming.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Dyson Farming]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dyson is interested in scaling up the tech, and potentially sharing it more widely when it\u2019s fully developed. \u201cWe are experimenting at this stage, but we\u2019ve unlocked significant efficiency gains for our glasshouse,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd for others too\u2014while we have to be relentlessly vigilant with confidentiality and secrecy at Dyson due to competitors stealing our innovations, in farming it\u2019s not like that. British farmers have been woefully under-supported by successive governments for years. They need a level playing field with their foreign counterparts. I\u2019m in a fortunate position to be able to take on risk and invest in experimenting with new ways of farming. And I hope it is eventually to the benefit of all farmers. We need to stand together.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working on the food system, he says, is not so different from the rest of his life\u2019s work. \u201cFarming shares a lot with engineering and manufacturing,\u201d Dyson says. \u201cYou create something, you take pride in it, and you supply it to people who need it. Just as a factory should be efficient, well-designed, and run using the latest technology, the same principles apply to farming. You must get the fundamentals right: drainage, access, boundaries, machinery, buildings, soil health, weed control, and biodiversity. It\u2019s about making everything work together, in the most effective and high-quality way possible. That&#8217;s how progress is made.\u201d</p>\n<hr />",

    "link": "https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-floods-oral-histories",
    "description": "<p class=\"byline\">\n                by <a class=\"name\" href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/logan-jaffe\">Logan Jaffe</a>                </p>\n                                          \n  \n\n\n\n                    \n<p>In late September 2000, longtime Kerr County, Texas, resident W. Thornton Secor Jr. sat down with an oral historian to <a href=\"https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth636788/\">tell his story</a>. Like many of the residents recorded as part of a decadeslong effort by the Kerr County Historical Commission to document the community\u2019s history, Secor had a lot to say about the area\u2019s floods. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt always seems to happen at night too,\u201d Secor said of local floods he and his family had experienced. \u201cCan\u2019t see most of it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Secor, who died in 2022, was a third-generation manager of a lodge that still operates along the Guadalupe River. His oral history shares family memories of floods going back to 1932 \u2014 like the time a flood that year washed away most of the cabins his grandfather built. </p>\n\n<p>Now, Secor\u2019s daughter, Mandi Secor Lipscomb, is left considering the future of the lodge in the aftermath of another devastating flood, on July 4. Secor Lipscomb is the fourth-generation owner and operator of the same lodge, <a href=\"https://www.waltonialodges.com/\">Waltonia on the River</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Often when I try to understand a place or process a big news event, I look for records kept by local historical societies and libraries. In archived documents, preserved photographs and oral history collections, one can start to see how a community understands itself. So, as news reports about the floods in the Central Texas Hill Country poured in throughout the week, I went looking for historical context. What local knowledge is held by people who live, or have lived, in what\u2019s repeatedly described as \u201cFlash Flood Alley\u201d? How have people in Kerr County\u2019s past contended with floods of their own time? </p>\n\n<p>A trove of more than 70 oral histories <a href=\"https://www.co.kerr.tx.us/historical/oralhistories.html\">recorded by the Kerr County Historical Commission</a> begins to answer those questions. The recordings document memories of floods going back to 1900, but oral histories alone rarely tell a full or accurate story. Still, there\u2019s at least one conclusion to draw: Everything has a history. The flood that killed more than 130 people in the Kerr County area this month <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/central-texas-hill-country-flooding-history/\">is not the first time</a> a flash flood on the Guadalupe River took lives of people, including children.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            The front page of a local newspaper, the Kerrville Daily Times, on July 20, 1987. A flash flood killed 10 campers as they tried to evacuate.\n    \n            (Kerrville Daily Times via Newspapers.com)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>I keep this history in mind when I hear local and state officials say no one could have seen this coming. Take <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLsbgiaSrg5/\">this exchange</a> between a reporter and Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reporter:</strong> Why weren\u2019t these camps evacuated?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> I can\u2019t answer that. I don\u2019t know.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reporter:</strong> Well you\u2019re the judge. I mean you\u2019re the top official here in this county. Why can\u2019t you answer that? There are kids missing. These camps were in harm\u2019s way. We knew this flood was coming.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> We didn\u2019t know this flood was coming. Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming. We have floods all the time. This is the most dangerous river valley in the United States. And we deal with floods on a regular basis. When it rains, we get water. We had no reason to believe that this was gonna be anything like what\u2019s happened here. None whatsoever. </p>\n\n<p>My colleague Jennifer Berry Hawes wrote last week about the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-flooding-evacuations-hurricane-helene\">uncanny similarities</a> between the Texas floods and Hurricane Helene, which struck North Carolina last year. In both disasters, weather forecasts predicted the potential devastation, yet people were left in harm\u2019s way.  </p>\n\n<p>And as another colleague, ProPublica editor Abrahm Lustgarten, pointed out in a piece about how <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-flash-flood-camp-mystic-climate-change-trump-noaa-fema\">climate change is making disasters like the flood in Texas more common</a>, \u201cthere will be tireless \u2014 and warranted \u2014 analysis of who is to blame for this heart-wrenching loss\u201d in the weeks to come.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShould Kerr County, where most of the deaths occurred, have installed warning sirens along that stretch of the waterway, and why were children allowed to sleep in an area prone to high-velocity flash flooding?\u201d Lustgarten wrote. \u201cWhy were urgent updates apparently only conveyed by cellphone and online in a rural area with limited connectivity?\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>As we wait for answers \u2014 or as journalists dig for them \u2014 the oral histories show Kerr County residents have warned one another, as well as newcomers and out-of-towners, about flooding for a long time. In his 2000 oral history, Secor said he remembered a time in the spring of 1959 when his father tried to warn one new-to-town woman about building a house so close to the river. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe took her out and showed her the watermarks on the trees in front of our house and all,\u201d Secor said, likely referring to the watermarks from the flood of 1932, which a local newspaper described at the time as \u201cthe most disastrous flood that ever swept the upper Guadalupe Valley.\u201d The flood killed at least <a href=\"https://climatexas.tamu.edu/products/severe-weather-summaries/1930s-texas-severe-weather\">seven people</a>. </p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 she says, \u2018that will never happen again,\u2019\u201d Secor recalled. </p>\n\n<p>He said her body was found in a tree a few months later after a flood swept her and the roof she stood on away. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to surprise newcomers when we get another flood like the \u201932 flood,\u201d Secor said in 2000.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get us again someday.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>As the Guadalupe River rose over the July 4 weekend, the 16-cabin lodge his daughter owns was sold out and full of guests. All of them escaped the floods, said Secor Lipscomb. They ran, some barefoot in the mud, up a steep hill beyond the property\u2019s retaining wall. They took shelter in a barn. </p>\n\n<p>Later, Secor Lipscomb assessed the damage to her family property. What she saw left her in tears: Four cabins had water up to the ceiling. Another two had flooded about 5 feet. But among the wreckage was a crew of nearly 40 volunteers, ready to help with the cleanup.</p>\n\n<p>By the time I reached out to her to ask her about her father\u2019s oral history, six cabins and the main camp office were already demolished. </p>\n\n<p>The cabin her great-grandfather and grandfather built together more than 100 years ago still stood. But it won\u2019t for much longer. It is so damaged with water that it, too, will have to go. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is our family history, our family legacy,\u201d Secor Lipscomb told me. \u201cOf course we\u2019re going to rebuild.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When they do, their customers will be ready. Many of the families who survived the flood already told her they\u2019ll be first in line to book for the next available July 4.</p>",

This was an \u201cunattended\u201d death: one where no doctor could attest to a medical reason for the person\u2019s demise. That made it the coroner\u2019s job to determine how and why she died.</p>\n\n<p>Strong, a stocky man with white hair and bushy eyebrows, explained that he and his wife lived in an RV park on the edge of the woods nearby. He said his wife had been bedridden for years with Parkinson\u2019s disease. That morning she\u2019d woken up and asked for peanut butter and water, Strong told the deputy. He found her dead some time later.</p>\n\n<p>The coroner looked over Betty Strong\u2019s body. It was thin and frail. He didn\u2019t see a reason to suspect anything other than a natural death for this 75-year-old woman. The sheriff\u2019s deputy seemed to be satisfied with the explanation too. So, the coroner ruled that Betty Strong died around 8:40 a.m. on Dec. 14, 2016, from complications of Parkinson\u2019s, and he signed off on allowing cremation of her body.</p>\n\n<p>Less than five years later, Clayton Strong\u2019s next wife turned up dead, too: shot in the chest in Texas.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that both marriages had a history of domestic unrest, with visits from police who documented threats to each woman\u2019s safety.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s impossible to know whether a different approach to investigating Betty Strong\u2019s death would have uncovered foul play. What is certain is that clues and evidence in the case were lost forever \u2014 and Idaho\u2019s system for death investigation let it happen.</p>\n\n<p>Family members of both women believe a more thorough investigation of the death in Idaho might have saved the life of Clayton Strong\u2019s next wife in Texas.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSomeone shows up with a dead body and just says they died of natural causes,\u201d said Amy Belanger, one of Betty Strong\u2019s children. \u201cI mean, really, do you just take their word for it?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The answer is no, according to five of six national death investigation experts ProPublica consulted. They said the coroner should have obtained medical records to confirm Betty Strong was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s, examined the trailer where her husband said she died, or both.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can think of all sorts of scenarios \u2014 criminal, accidental or natural \u2014 that could have occurred there,\u201d said Jennifer Snippen, a death investigator, educator and consultant in Oregon. \u201cBut my argument is, if you don\u2019t go to the scene and you don\u2019t look at the medical records, you just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Most of the county coroners in Idaho are part-time elected officials with tiny budgets and no oversight or state funding to support their work. The national experts said that kind of system is more prone to cursory investigations like the one into Betty Strong\u2019s death.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/idaho-coroner-law-failed-reform\">failure to reform death investigations in Idaho</a> has <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/idaho-coroner-reform-timeline\">raised alarms for more than 70 years</a>, according to current and former Idaho coroners and previous ProPublica reporting.</p>\n\n<p>A national magazine called Idaho \u201cthe best place in the nation for a criminal to \u2018get away with murder\u2019 in the literal sense\u201d because of the state\u2019s \u201cantiquated county coroner\u2019s system,\u201d the Idaho Statesman newspaper reported in 1951.</p>\n\n<p>Asked whether murderers have escaped prosecution in Idaho\u2019s coroner system, Rich Riffle, coroner for the county that includes Boise, said, \u201cMy humble opinion? Yes.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>That almost happened in 2019 when one inexperienced Idaho coroner decided to take the word of Chad Daybell that his wife, Tammy Daybell, had died in her sleep after chronic health problems, vomiting and a cough. Her body was later exhumed after his next wife\u2019s children went missing. An autopsy by the Utah medical examiner\u2019s office found what medical records would have shown, had the Idaho coroner requested them: Tammy Daybell was healthy. A jury convicted Chad Daybell of murdering her by asphyxiation and of killing his next wife\u2019s two youngest children. The case is under appeal.</p>\n\n<p>At trial, coroner Brenda Dye said she had regrets. Her voice shaking, Dye told the court she would have ordered an autopsy if she\u2019d known better, but \u201cat that time, with my limited training and being new, I did the best I could.\u201d She declined ProPublica\u2019s interview request, citing <a href=\"https://www.ksl.com/article/50799068/idaho-coroner-discusses-case-thats-still-giving-her-nightmares-and-why-1st-year-was-worst-ever\">the case\u2019s effect on her mental health</a>.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            The community set up a memorial to two children who Chad Daybell was convicted of murdering; he was also convicted of killing his previous wife Tammy. The coroner originally believed Chad Daybell when he said that Tammy had died in her sleep.\n    \n            (John Roark/Post Register via AP)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Idaho isn\u2019t the only place where death investigations fall short. Because there is no uniform federal system, the rigor with which your death is investigated depends on where you die. Other states lack enough forensic pathologists to do autopsies. And many local systems like Idaho County\u2019s are squeezed for money.</p>\n\n<p>But even among its short-staffed, underfunded peers, Idaho stands out. One measure is the state\u2019s autopsy rate: third-lowest for autopsies in all deaths, last in the nation for autopsies in known cases of homicide.</p>\n\n<p>Gov. Brad Little said in January that he would support more state resources to help Idaho\u2019s coroners do their jobs. But he never got the chance; coroner-related bills passed by the Idaho Legislature this year contained no funding or other assistance for coroners and death investigations.</p>\n\n<p>So for now, each of Idaho\u2019s 44 coroners will bear costs that other states help cover: driving a body hundreds of miles to an autopsy; paying for some of those autopsies; or trying to recruit one more person to join Idaho\u2019s statewide forensic pathology workforce of three.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t care enough about how death investigations are done in your jurisdiction to invest in the people doing it, to provide them with the resources or to have high enough standards for the people that you hire to do this, you\u2019re going to get what you get, what you accept,\u201d said Snippen. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get what you allow to happen.\u201d</p>\n\nFlorida, 2010-2015\n<p>Betty Brock was a mother of seven who enjoyed singing and art, long bicycle rides, organizing family photos and researching her ancestry.</p>\n\n<p>She was caring for her terminally ill husband in 2010 when Clayton Strong befriended her on the internet, according to Belanger, her daughter. Strong claimed to be \u201cbasically destitute and living in his car,\u201d a backstory that appealed to a woman with a soft spot for taking in \u201cwounded people\u201d and trying to heal them with love, Belanger said.</p>\n\n<p>Strong drove hundreds of miles from Southwest Florida and showed up at the Brocks\u2019 property in the Florida panhandle. They agreed he could sleep in his car there as long as he helped with caregiving and housework. Soon he was sleeping in an outbuilding on the property, then in the house.</p>\n\n<p>Betty\u2019s children were puzzled as this newcomer became a fixture in their mother\u2019s life. They wanted to give Strong a chance, but they soon grew suspicious.</p>\n\n<p>Betty Brock\u2019s husband died in August 2010. By January, she was Betty Strong.</p>\n\n<p>After their courthouse marriage, Clayton Strong used their now-shared funds to buy a Ford truck and an Airstream trailer and took his bride on the road, Belanger said. The couple visited national parks that Betty had always wanted to see. They camped and hiked their way across the continent. They bought mining claims and panned for gold in the remote Idaho wilderness.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Betty and Clayton Strong. Betty\u2019s children say Clayton isolated her, threatened them when they tried to visit her, kept her from seeing her doctor, then took her to Idaho, where she died.\n    \n            (Courtesy of Amy Belanger)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>After that honeymoon, the walls around Betty Strong grew impenetrable, her children said. According to what two of her children told ProPublica and to statements two others made to police, Clayton became the gatekeeper of all communication with their mother, and he padlocked the doors of their Florida home and held the key.</p>\n\n<p>The last time Betty Strong saw her primary care doctor in Florida was in May 2013, according to records her son obtained after the death. Before that, she hadn\u2019t been in since 2010, the year Clayton Strong entered her life. The notes from the 2013 checkup show health issues common in older adults but no Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis, and neither Parkinson\u2019s nor other neurodegenerative diseases were listed in the family history section.</p>\n\n<p>The children watched from afar as the marriage devolved over the next two years. Between January 2014 and February 2015, police went to the couple\u2019s residence for welfare checks and domestic disturbances at least six times, according to police reports that Belanger provided to ProPublica. </p>\n\n<p>Her children told police that Clayton Strong threatened to shoot them if they set foot on the property, threatened to hurt their mother if they didn\u2019t back off, and prevented her from seeing a doctor.</p>\n\n<p>In the first of those police visits, in January 2014, the records show that Belanger\u2019s sister, who lived nearby, called the sheriff while standing outside the Strong residence, a brown house surrounded by oak trees and pines on a winding country road. A deputy arrived to find Belanger\u2019s sister and Clayton Strong in a stalemate, then talked to everyone outside, according to a sheriff\u2019s office report. The deputy then watched as Betty Strong turned to her husband to \u201cask him for permission\u201d to hug her daughter, and Clayton Strong \u201cremoved a set of keys from his pocket and unlocked the porch entrance gate so Betty could go in the yard\u201d for the hug.</p>\n\n<p>The report says the deputy made a referral to Florida Department of Children and Families, the agency that investigates possible abuse of vulnerable adults, and that the department opened a case.</p>\n\n<p>A similar scene played out when one of Betty Strong\u2019s sons went to the house to check on her in February 2015. For two years, Clayton Strong turned the son away when he tried to visit, and this time Strong \u201cthreatened to shoot him with a gun if he did not leave,\u201d the son told a sheriff\u2019s deputy. Clayton Strong denied that, the deputy\u2019s report says.</p>\n\n<p>The deputy found Betty Strong alone on a bed in an RV parked behind the home, the report says. She said she had Parkinson\u2019s disease and couldn\u2019t get around well. Clayton wasn\u2019t holding her against her will, she told the deputy, but she couldn\u2019t take care of herself without him.</p>\n\n<p>She had a walkie-talkie. The deputy asked: Is Clayton using that radio and telling you what to say? Betty answered \u201cno\u201d while nodding her head \u201cyes.\u201d It was a chilly afternoon, and the deputy noticed Betty had a blanket but no heater. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cBetty\u2019s demeanor, living conditions, and the controlling behavior by Clayton\u201d warranted a referral to the Florida Department of Children and Families, the deputy wrote.</p>\n\n<p>Asked for the outcome of that referral, a spokesperson told ProPublica the department investigates \u201call allegations of abuse, neglect, or exploitation\u201d but that records of those investigations are confidential under state law.</p>\n\n<p>Days after the referral in February 2015, police were again dispatched to the Florida home. This time, it wasn\u2019t one of Betty Strong\u2019s children who called; it was someone from adult protective services in need of police backup. According to the dispatch log, the worker said Clayton Strong \u201chas threatened before to pull a gun on her and is very anti-law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The couple left town a month later. Betty Strong\u2019s children never heard from her again.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Betty Strong early in her relationship with Clayton Strong. Within a few years of this trip, Clayton told authorities she\u2019d died of Parkinson\u2019s, but her children say she never had the disease.\n    \n            (Courtesy of Amy Belanger)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \nIdaho, December 2016\n<p>By the time Betty Strong died in Idaho County in December 2016, she hadn\u2019t been seen in Florida in 21 months.</p>\n\n<p>Idaho County\u2019s elected coroner, Cody Funke, had been in the job about as long.</p>\n\n<p>He knew the county well. Its vast forests, mountains and meadows stretch across more land than Massachusetts. Rugged and remote, it attracts people who want to be left alone and who distrust both government and conventional medicine. </p>\n\n<p>Funke, pronounced \u201cfunk,\u201d was in his late 20s in 2014 when he learned his part-time job at a funeral home was being eliminated. His boss asked: Had he considered running for coroner? The coroner at the time was retiring and urged Funke to do it. So did Funke\u2019s boss from his other part-time job, as an EMT. What sealed the deal for Funke: As coroner, he would get health insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Funke started the job with a feeling of \u201cgood luck, godspeed, you\u2019re gonna need it.\u201d There was no apprenticeship or ride-along to watch seasoned pros, like he\u2019d gotten when he trained to be an EMT. There was a training conference he attended in Las Vegas before taking office, and Funke received more than double the 24 hours of coroner education required by Idaho law. Even so, he isn\u2019t sure it was enough to prepare him. </p>\n\n<p>Funke learned on his first day that he wasn\u2019t getting a vehicle to move bodies from a death scene. If the local funeral home\u2019s vehicle was occupied, Funke had to use his family truck. A year after Betty Strong\u2019s death, the county commission got the coroner a vehicle: a pickup truck the sheriff\u2019s office didn\u2019t need anymore.</p>\n\n<p>The office he inherited also had no camera, and the county hadn\u2019t budgeted to give him one. He\u2019d have to use his phone to take pictures of bodies and death scenes.</p>\n\n<p>There was no morgue.</p>\n\n<p>The Idaho County coroner\u2019s office didn\u2019t even have an actual office.</p>\n\n<p>Funke\u2019s predecessors kept their files on paper, at home, he learned. The previous coroner\u2019s house had flooded, so when Funke took over, all that remained fit in two manila folders.</p>\n\n<p>The coroner\u2019s entire budget this year is $85,651. By comparison, coroner\u2019s offices serving small populations had an average budget of $280,000 in 2018, according to a national study.</p>\n\n<p>Paid $13,000 a year, Funke is on call 24 hours a day and, last year, investigated and ruled on 71 deaths, about one every five days. Papers on an additional 102 deaths of people under a doctor\u2019s care came through needing his signature for cremation.</p>\n\n<p>Funke does the coroner work on top of a full-time job. When a call comes in during business hours, he dips out to go to a death scene. If someone dies at dinnertime, he might not see his family until morning.</p>\n\n<p>He must decide with each death what the circumstances require: a simple phone call; an all-out investigation with autopsy, witness interviews, tissue samples and more; or something in the middle.</p>\n\n<p>To examine a death scene, Funke might have to drive three hours or longer each way. Whenever he orders an autopsy, Funke or his deputies have to take the body to the nearest autopsy center, a trip that takes a full day and usually demands an overnight stay. His current budget can cover 10 autopsies a year.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Cody Funke, the Idaho County coroner, also worked full time as a city wastewater treatment operator. He now works for the state prison system while remaining the coroner.\n    \n            (Liesbeth Powers for ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In those first years as coroner, Funke often leaned on police.</p>\n\n<p>Funke found it strange that Clayton Strong had loaded his wife\u2019s body into their SUV and driven to the hospital. Most people call 911 to report a death and wait for help to arrive, Funke said. But Strong offered an explanation that seemed to satisfy the sheriff\u2019s deputy: He didn\u2019t know many people in town and wasn\u2019t sure what to do.</p>\n\n<p>Strong had said his wife hadn\u2019t seen a doctor because she stuck to homeopathic remedies. That\u2019s not unusual for Funke to hear. </p>\n\n<p>The widower gave Funke the impression a coroner and sheriff\u2019s deputy wouldn\u2019t be welcome inside the trailer where she died. That\u2019s not so outside the norm for Idaho County either, Funke said.</p>\n\n<p>Betty Strong\u2019s death looked like an easy call. So Funke helped move her body to a cot to be taken from the hospital to a local funeral home.</p>\n\n<p>According to a later report from the sheriff\u2019s office, Clayton Strong showed up at the funeral home that day, said he wanted her cremated and paid $2,310 in cash. The way Funke heard it from a funeral home employee a few days later, Strong paid in $100 bills out of a lunch box.</p>\n\n<p>The detail struck Funke as peculiar. But he let it go.</p>\n\nFlorida, 2017\n<p>The couple\u2019s Airstream trailer showed up one day in January 2017, parked outside their house in Florida. A neighbor called Amy Belanger with the news, and she dispatched her brother, Daniel, who lived nearby. They\u2019d spent almost two years fearing the worst.</p>\n\n<p>The only person at the house was Clayton Strong.</p>\n\n<p>The family\u2019s matriarch had died a few weeks ago in Harpster, Idaho, Strong said. Then he told his son-in-law to get off the property.</p>\n\n<p>Amy Belanger started making calls the next day. One of the first people she reached was Funke, the county coroner. She was perplexed, she said. Why hadn\u2019t anyone called her or her siblings? Why didn\u2019t he question whether Betty Strong had actually succumbed to a disease or if something else had killed her? Belanger told Funke about the history of police calls in Florida and concerns about their mother\u2019s safety.</p>\n\n<p>Funke thought back to what he\u2019d heard from the funeral home. A lunch box of cash for a cremation? That image never sat quite right. Now he had solid ground for suspicion. Funke told Belanger he\u2019d talk to the county prosecutor and see what could be done. </p>\n\n<p>The prosecutor and the sheriff\u2019s office initially told Belanger they had opened a homicide investigation, according to a detailed timeline she created at the time. But the death scene \u2014 the Strongs\u2019 trailer \u2014 was long gone, the body cremated. The sheriff\u2019s investigator and prosecutor ultimately didn\u2019t seem to think there was enough evidence for a homicide investigation, Funke told ProPublica. </p>\n\n<p>(The prosecutor and sheriff\u2019s investigator did not return phone calls, emails or certified letters from ProPublica requesting comment on their decisions following Betty Strong\u2019s death.)</p>\n\n<p>Notes from Belanger\u2019s timeline quote a Florida detective saying he was sorry the death had occurred outside his jurisdiction. He explained to her that \u201cin Florida, deputies would have had the medical examiner\u2019s office verify medical records and take a blood sample.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The year Betty Strong died, 20% of natural deaths investigated by a medical examiner in the part of Florida where she had lived underwent autopsies before the examiner decided the cause of death was natural. About 65% of all deaths taken in by Florida\u2019s medical examiner that year were autopsied. Both numbers dwarf Idaho\u2019s coroner autopsy rates.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just Florida. Many states have more sophisticated systems for investigating deaths than Idaho\u2019s. In much of the country, centralized state medical examiner offices oversee all death investigations or provide a backstop to elected coroners in each county. </p>\n\n<p>Idaho\u2019s rural neighbor Montana has a hybrid system of medical examiners and coroners, supported by a <a href=\"https://nij.ojp.gov/program/national-center-forensics/creating-coroner-liaison-position\">coroner liaison</a> who works with death investigators to make the process more consistent statewide. And next door in Wyoming, a state board sets <a href=\"https://post.wyo.gov/board-of-coroners/post-coroner-rules\">rules for coroners to follow</a>. The rules spell out what each death investigation should include: scene investigation, toxicology sample, DNA sample, photographs, external examination of the body and an inventory of property, evidence and medications.</p>\n\n<p>Jennifer Snippen, the death investigator in Oregon, was one of the experts who drafted the National Institute of Justice\u2019s 2024 death-scene investigation guidebook.</p>\n\n<p>She said death investigations are more likely to be thorough when states and counties give their investigators enough funding and education, \u201cso that they have the motivation and the ability to get to as many scenes, and get as much information about every single death, as possible.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Those who study the work of coroners and medical examiners in the U.S. have learned that the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/gone-without-a-case-suspicious-elder-deaths-rarely-investigated\">deaths of elderly people are especially likely to be written off as age-related</a>, without considering whether the person may have also been a victim of abuse or neglect.</p>\n\n<p>Snippen\u2019s <a href=\"https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/m900p302v\">research in 2023</a> is one of the most recent studies to confirm that. She reviewed data from thousands of cases. The person least likely to get a scene investigation or autopsy? An elderly woman who dies at home.</p>\n\n<p>Lauri McGivern, a nationally recognized expert in death investigations, said national standards would have Funke verify Betty Strong\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis and ask more questions of Clayton Strong as the sole caregiver of a vulnerable adult. McGivern, who coordinates medicolegal death investigations in Vermont, reviewed the facts that Funke was given at the time of Betty Strong\u2019s death and his subsequent report at ProPublica\u2019s request.</p>\n\n<p>To follow national standards, McGivern said, Funke also would have gone to the Airstream trailer or asked law enforcement to examine the death scene and report back to him.</p>\n\n<p>But McGivern and other experts said they understand why Funke didn\u2019t follow those national guidelines \u2014 because they\u2019ve seen it happen so many times in places like rural Idaho.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing what he was shown how to do,\u201d McGivern said. \u201cAnd probably doing the best he can, with no budget and no support and no education.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            When Funke took over from Idaho County\u2019s previous coroner in 2015, there was no equipment. Over the years, Funke had to get county commissioners to approve purchases like a radio to take coroner calls.\n    \n            (Liesbeth Powers for ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Frustrated by how little Idaho officials knew and why they hadn\u2019t dug further into her mother\u2019s death, Amy Belanger channeled her grief into trying to find answers on her own.</p>\n\n<p>She followed a trail of public records left by Clayton Strong. Had he harmed other women? Had he been in a relationship with anybody who went missing? \u201cI was looking into his past to see if there was a pattern like that,\u201d Belanger said. Something she could share with officials in Idaho.</p>\n\n<p>Then she stumbled across a document: a recent marriage license.</p>\n\n<p>Three months after depositing Betty Strong\u2019s body at a hospital in Idaho, Clayton Strong wed a woman from Texas.</p>\n\n<p>Belanger needed to warn her.</p>\n\nTexas, 2017-2021\n<p>Shirley Weatherley had a lot in common with Betty Strong. She was a mother and grandmother. She\u2019d been married before. She lived in a small, modest home on a large piece of land in a rural locale, where she\u2019d been caring for a terminally ill former spouse when Strong contacted her on Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>They\u2019d known each other as teenagers in Lubbock. Their reconnection after he arrived at her house in Weatherford, a suburb of Fort Worth, eventually began to worry her children.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe isolated her,\u201d said\u00a0Jamie Barrington, Weatherley\u2019s son with a previous husband. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let grandkids, my brother \u2014 anybody\u2019d come over, he just kept them at arm\u2019s length.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Shirley Weatherley\n    \n            (Courtesy of Jamie Barrington)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Barrington said he and other members of Weatherley\u2019s family had suspicions about Strong. Then they connected with Belanger and heard what happened in Florida and Idaho.</p>\n\n<p>Belanger urged the family to tell their mother everything they\u2019d heard. She \u201cactually was pleading with us to watch out,\u201d Barrington recalled. </p>\n\n<p>Knowing another family was worried helped fuel Amy Belanger\u2019s quest for the truth about her mother\u2019s death. Her siblings chipped in to help Belanger rent a van and drive across the country in search of clues \u2014 anything that could shed light on her mother\u2019s death.</p>\n\n<p>Once she got to Idaho, Belanger spent more than a week investigating. She met with the coroner and sheriff. She went to the mining claims the Strongs had purchased. She stayed at the RV park where Betty Strong died and interviewed the people who\u2019d owned it in 2016; they remembered talking to each other about how \u201chinky\u201d the death and Clayton Strong\u2019s reaction to it seemed.</p>\n\n<p>Back in Texas, Weatherley\u2019s family tried to warn her. </p>\n\n<p>When they relayed the story about Betty Strong to her, Weatherley chalked it up to a grieving family trying to cope with loss by grasping for an explanation, Barrington said. After all, Strong had a death certificate that listed natural causes. </p>\n\n<p>The details Barrington later learned from family members and police about his mother\u2019s life with Strong were \u201cpretty horrific,\u201d he said. Weatherley had reported that Strong threatened to kill her, but no charges were filed. Then at one point, in the midst of an argument with Strong, Weatherley lobbed the accusations about Betty Strong\u2019s death at him, Barrington said. Strong flew into a rage.</p>\n\n<p>Weatherley called police in July 2021. She and Strong were splitting up, and he shoved her while moving his stuff out of the house, Weatherley told the officer. Strong had \u201churt her\u201d in the past, so she called police to make sure it didn\u2019t happen again, the officer\u2019s report says. The officer got Strong\u2019s side of the story \u2014 she was \u201crunning him off,\u201d but he didn\u2019t push her \u2014 and stuck around until Strong agreed to leave.</p>\n\n<p>Police would later document finding two items in the house. The first was a copy of Weatherley\u2019s will that left everything to Strong, on which she\u2019d written \u201cVOID,\u201d the second was a digital camera hidden in their bedroom. The camera contained selfies of injuries to her face and chest and a video of Strong putting his arm around her neck as she screamed for help.</p>\n\n<p>Strong persuaded Weatherley to let him back into their home once more on Aug. 4, 2021, according to police records.</p>\n\n<p>Four days later, Weatherley\u2019s son and grandson found her body wrapped in a gray tarp near the front steps to her home. She\u2019d been shot in the chest. Authorities matched shell casings at the scene to an AK-47-style rifle, which security footage showed Strong ditching in a shopping cart outside a Walmart.</p>\n\n<p>Picked up later by police in Mexico, Strong died of cardiac arrest while awaiting extradition in Weatherley\u2019s killing.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Mexican police booked Clayton Strong on gun charges in 2021. After the arrest, they discovered he was a suspect in the murder of his wife in Texas.\n    \n            (Parker County Sheriff\u2019s Office via Facebook)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \nToday\n<p>Jamie Barrington, Shirley Weatherley\u2019s son, was reluctant at first to speak publicly about his mother\u2019s death in Texas, even years later. He agreed to talk with ProPublica, he said, because he wants Idaho\u2019s coroner system to improve. He said he never imagined that a death like Betty Strong\u2019s could be ruled \u201cnatural\u201d based on what a spouse told authorities.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI truly believe that if there had been a proper investigation and not taking his word for it,\u201d Barrington said, \u201cthat it probably would have made a big difference\u201d in what happened to Shirley Weatherley.</p>\n\n<p>Word of Weatherley\u2019s murder eventually reached Funke, the coroner in Idaho. He said in hindsight, Strong\u2019s actions in Idaho County seem more suspicious than they did at the time to his inexperienced eyes and ears.</p>\n\n<p>Now, after 10 years as coroner, \u201cI would have pushed a little bit harder\u201d to have an officer or deputy follow up or go to the RV park with him. He would have asked police to use a national database \u2014 one he didn\u2019t know about at the time \u2014 to find Betty Strong\u2019s family members and learn more about her background. \u201cI have trust issues after cases like this,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Funke said the story of Betty Strong\u2019s death needs to be told, even if it shows that he and Idaho County made mistakes, because it can help lawmakers understand what is wrong with the state\u2019s system.</p>\n\n<p>Idaho\u2019s coroners need more funding, he said, because right now they\u2019re an afterthought in county budgets. Most counties set a coroner salary at what amounts to less than minimum wage, so it\u2019s impossible for someone like Funke to be coroner without a second, full-time job.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese offices should be fully staffed,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we have one or two people that are here full time to answer questions and respond to these calls, versus, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve got to take time off work, boss.\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And he believes new coroners who lack experience should be required to learn how to work a case from start to finish before they\u2019re called out to a death like Betty Strong\u2019s.</p>\n\n<p>Daniel Belanger, one of Betty Strong\u2019s children, came away from his interactions with Idaho County officials convinced that the only way deaths like his mother\u2019s will be properly investigated is through legislation forcing coroners and law enforcement agencies to change their approaches.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey completely dropped the ball,\u201d he told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>Amy Belanger said her family has reclaimed very few of her mother\u2019s possessions from the Airstream trailer. Strong emptied the Florida house of family heirlooms after their mother\u2019s death, Belanger said. Most of the family photo albums her mother toiled over are gone.</p>\n\n<p>The brown house on the winding road in Florida is still there. Belanger\u2019s memories of family cookouts and holiday gatherings linger in the house; they weren\u2019t wiped away by the police visits and padlocked doors. But the family home isn\u2019t the family\u2019s anymore. Years later, it is stuck in legal limbo \u2014 the deed still in the name of Clayton Strong and Shirley Weatherley, the woman he married after the death of Betty Strong.</p>",

(TCN) --</strong> A 26-year-old woman stands accused of fatally stabbing her 39-year-old manager, a mother of six who worked at a McDonald's restaurant for 15 years.</p>\n        <p><a href=\"https://www.macombgov.org/departments/prosecutors-office/news/worker-arraigned-allegedly-killing-manager-mcdonalds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">According to the Macomb County Prosecutor's Office</a>, on the morning of July 10, Jennifer Harris, a manager at McDonald's, sent Afeni Muhammad home early from her shift. Muhammad allegedly came back to the restaurant through the employee entrance wearing a mask and armed with a knife before stabbing Harris multiple times.</p>\n        <p>A customer at the drive-thru window reportedly intervened and fired his legally concealed weapon. Prosecutors said Muhammad fled, and the armed customer followed her and held her at gunpoint until Eastpointe Police arrived.</p>\n        <p>Muhammad was arraigned on July 11 on charges of first-degree premeditated murder and carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent. A judge set her bond at $25 million.</p>\n        <p>In a statement, Macomb County Prosecutor Peter Lucido said, \"This is an absolutely senseless and heartbreaking tragedy. A life was taken in an act of unimaginable violence. The victim leaves behind six children, six young lives that will now grow up without a parent. This isn\u2019t just a statistic; this is a family shattered, a future forever altered.\"</p>\n        <p>The prosecutor continued, \"It is deeply troubling that we continue to see violence used as a response to conflict. How have we reached a point where, for some, the solution to a disagreement or problem is to pick up a weapon instead of finding a way to resolve differences peacefully? This should not be normal, and it must not be accepted as the status quo.\"</p>\n        <p>MORE:</p>\n        <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macombgov.org/departments/prosecutors-office/news/worker-arraigned-allegedly-killing-manager-mcdonalds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Worker arraigned for allegedly killing manager at McDonald's - Macomb County Prosecutor's Office</a></li></ul>",

Additionally, the Defense Department requires that people handling sensitive data be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. </p>\n\n<p>This presented an issue for Microsoft, which relies on a vast global workforce with significant operations in India, China and the European Union.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                        \n    \n        Microsoft established its low-profile \u201cdigital escort\u201d program to get around this prohibition.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Microsoft\u2019s foreign workforce is not permitted to access sensitive cloud systems directly, so the tech giant hired U.S.-based \u201cdigital escorts,\u201d who had security clearances that authorized them to access sensitive information, to take direction from the overseas experts. The engineers might briefly describe the job to be completed \u2014 for instance, updating a firewall, installing an update to fix a bug or reviewing logs to troubleshoot a problem. Then the escort copies and pastes the engineer\u2019s commands into the federal cloud.</p>\n\n<p>The problem, ProPublica found, is that digital escorts don\u2019t necessarily have the advanced technical expertise needed to spot problems.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trusting that what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t malicious, but we really can\u2019t tell,\u201d said one current escort.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        The escorts handle data that, if leaked, would have \u201ccatastrophic\u201d effects.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Microsoft uses the escort system to handle the government\u2019s most sensitive information that falls below \u201cclassified.\u201d According to the government, this includes \u201cdata that involves the protection of life and financial ruin.\u201d The \u201closs of confidentiality, integrity, or availability\u201d of this information \u201ccould be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect\u201d on operations, assets and individuals, the government has said.</p>\n\n<p>Defense Department data in this category includes materials that directly support military operations.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                        \n    \n        The program could expose Pentagon data to cyberattacks.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Because the U.S.-based escorts are taking direction from foreign engineers, including those based in China, the nation\u2019s greatest cyber adversary, it is possible that an escort could unwittingly insert malicious code into the Defense Department\u2019s computer systems.</p>\n\n<p>A former Microsoft engineer who worked on the system acknowledged this possibility. \u201cIf someone ran a script called \u2018fix_servers.sh\u2019 but it actually did something malicious, then [escorts] would have no idea,\u201d the engineer, Matthew Erickson, told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>Pradeep Nair, a former Microsoft vice president who said he helped develop the concept from the start, said a variety of safeguards including audit logs, the digital trail of system activity, could alert Microsoft or the government to potential problems. \u201cBecause these controls are stringent, residual risk is minimal,\u201d Nair said.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        Digital escorts present a natural opportunity for spies, experts say.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cIf I were an operative, I would look at that as an avenue for extremely valuable access. We need to be very concerned about that,\u201d said Harry Coker, who was a senior executive at the CIA and the National Security Agency. Coker, who also was national cyber director during the Biden administration, added that he and his former intelligence colleagues \u201cwould love to have had access like that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Chinese laws allow government officials there to collect data \u201cas long as they\u2019re doing something that they\u2019ve deemed legitimate,\u201d said Jeremy Daum, senior research fellow at the Paul Tsai China Center at Yale Law School. Microsoft\u2019s China-based tech support for the U.S. government presents an opening for Chinese espionage, \u201cwhether it be putting someone who\u2019s already an intelligence professional into one of those jobs, or going to the people who are in the jobs and pumping them for information,\u201d Daum said. \u201cIt would be difficult for any Chinese citizen or company to meaningfully resist a direct request from security forces or law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                        \n    \n        Microsoft says the program is government-approved.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In a statement, Microsoft said that its personnel and contractors operate in a manner \u201cconsistent with US Government requirements and processes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The company\u2019s global workers \u201chave no direct access to customer data or customer systems,\u201d the statement said. Escorts \u201cwith the appropriate clearances and training provide direct support. These personnel are provided specific training on protecting sensitive data, preventing harm, and use of the specific commands/controls within the environment.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Insight Global \u2014 a contractor that provides digital escorts to Microsoft \u2014 said it \u201cevaluates the technical capabilities of each resource throughout the interview process to ensure they possess the technical skills required\u201d for the job and provides training.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        Microsoft says it disclosed details of the escort program to the government. Former Pentagon officials said they\u2019d never heard of it.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Microsoft told ProPublica that it described the escort model in documents submitted to the government as part of cloud vendor authorization processes. Former defense and intelligence officials said in interviews that they had never heard of digital escorts. Even the Defense Department\u2019s IT agency didn\u2019t know about it until reached for comment by ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI probably should have known about this,\u201d said John Sherman, who was chief information officer for the Defense Department during the Biden administration. He said the system is a major security risk for the department and called for a \u201cthorough review by [the Defense Information Systems Agency], Cyber Command and other stakeholders that are involved in this.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>DISA said, \u201cExperts under escort supervision have no direct, hands-on access to government systems; but rather offer guidance and recommendations to authorized administrators who perform tasks.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                        \n    \n        There were warnings early on about the risks.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Multiple people raised concerns about the escort strategy over the years, including while it was still in development. A former Microsoft employee, who was involved in the company\u2019s cybersecurity strategy, told an executive they opposed the concept, viewing it as too risky from a security perspective. </p>\n\n<p>Around 2016, Microsoft engaged contacts from Lockheed Martin to hire escorts. The project manager says they told their counterpart at Microsoft they were concerned the escorts would not have the \u201cright eyes\u201d for the job given the relatively low pay.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft did not respond to questions about these points.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        Other cloud providers wouldn\u2019t say if they also use escorts.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>It\u2019s unclear whether other major cloud service providers to the federal government also use digital escorts in tech support. Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud declined to comment on the record for this article. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with his Chinese counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, at the ASEAN Summit. Rubio described the exchange as \u201cconstructive\u201d and hinted at a possible upcoming meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. China described the exchange as \u201cconstructive and pragmatic.\u201d</p><p>This exchange followed the comments of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, at the Shangri-La Dialogues in Singapore on May 31, 2025: \u201cAny attempt by China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world.\u201d Despite these words of caution, in mid-June 2025 and in preceding months, China deployed fighter jets, naval vessels and drones around Taiwan in air-sea joint training exercises meant to intimidate Taipei.</p><p>China\u2019s recent actions in the Yellow Sea, to include incursions into South Korean territorial waters and airspace, are also of concern. This comes at a time when China continues to claim all of the South China Sea as their own, despite a United Nations Tribunal\u2019s 2016 ruling that China\u2019s claims to the South China Sea, based on its \u201cnine dash line\u201d map, were not legally valid.</p><p>There is considerable concern that China will use its military to invade or blockade Taiwan by 2027, when China supposedly would have the military might to attempt unification by force. That would be a grave mistake.</p><p>The U.S. \u2013 China relationship is tense, with some predicting an eventual war, despite $582.4 billion in total trade with China in 2024, $126.9 billion of U.S. foreign direct investment in China and over 277,000 Chinese students studying in the U.S. China\u2019s actions in the South China, East China and Yellow Seas and their attempted military intimidation of Taiwan all contribute to this tense relationship.</p><p><strong>The U.S. was there for China</strong></p><p>The U.S. was there for China when Deng Xiaoping reached out to the U.S. in 1979, after normalization of relations, and established a strategic relationship with the U.S. that contributed to the defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, the end of the Cold War in 1991 and joint U.S. \u2013 China cooperation on counter terrorism, counter nuclear proliferation, counter narcotics and joint efforts to counter international organized crime. And there were over 300,000 Chinese students studying in the U.S. with significant U.S. investment in China, which contributed to providing China with Most Favored Nation status in 2000, a move that exponentially expanded bilateral trade.</p><p>And it was the U.S. that got China into the World Trade Organization in December 2001. Indeed, China\u2019s membership in WTO favorably impacted China\u2019s economic development; it was a catalyst for China\u2019s economic growth and modernization.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

The willingness of these two superpowers to work jointly on these global problems, as we did in the 1980s and 1990s, would be welcomed by all countries, except for the Russian Federation and Iran.</p><p>The recent meeting of Marco Rubio and Wang Yi and hopefully the eventual meeting of Presidents Xi and Trump could be the beginning of a relationship that not only deals with the tension in the bilateral relationship but also deals with the common good both nations could do if we worked together on a myriad of socio-economic and geopolitical challenges confronting the global community. Moving in this would require bold and sustained leadership, reminiscent of the 1980s and 1990s. </p><p><strong><em>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in </em></strong><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/14/china-improve-relations-us/\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Times</a></em></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</em></strong></p>",

In an email obtained by ProPublica, De Mello said he had identified multiple legal \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the agency\u2019s request.</p>\n\n<p>Two days later, on June 27, De Mello was forced out of his job, people familiar with the dispute said. The addresses have not yet been released to ICE. De Mello did not respond to requests for comment, and the administration did not address questions sent by ProPublica about his departure.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Government Efficiency began pushing the IRS to provide taxpayer data to immigration agents soon after President Donald Trump took office. The tax agency\u2019s acting general counsel refused and was replaced by De Mello, who Trump administration officials viewed as more willing to carry out the president\u2019s agenda. Soon after, the Department of Homeland Security, ICE\u2019s parent agency, and the IRS negotiated a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d that included specific legal guardrails to safeguard taxpayers\u2019 private information.</p>\n\n<p>In his email, De Mello said ICE\u2019s request for millions of records did not meet those requirements, which include having a written assurance that each taxpayer whose address is being sought was under active criminal investigation.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s just no way ICE has 7 million real criminal investigations, that\u2019s a fantasy,\u201d said a former senior IRS official who had been advising the agency on this issue. The demands from the DHS were \u201cunprecedented,\u201d the official added, saying the agency was pressing the IRS to do what amounted to \u201ca big data dump.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In the past, when law enforcement sought IRS data to support its investigations, agencies would give the IRS the full legal name of the target, an address on file and an explanation of why the information was relevant to a criminal inquiry. Such requests rarely involved more than a dozen people at a time, former IRS officials said.</p>\n\n<p>Danny Werfel, IRS commissioner during the Biden administration, said the privacy laws allowing federal investigators to obtain taxpayer data have never \u201cbeen read to open the door to the sharing of thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of tax records for a broad-based enforcement initiative.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for the White House said the planned use of IRS data was legal and a means of fulfilling Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to carry out mass deportations of \u201cillegal criminal aliens.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Taxpayer data is among the most confidential in the federal government and is protected by strict privacy laws, which have historically limited its transfer to law enforcement and other government agencies. Unauthorized disclosure of taxpayer return information is a felony that can carry a penalty of up to five years in prison.</p>\n\n<p>The system that the IRS is now creating would give ICE automated access to home addresses en masse, limiting the ability of IRS officials to consider the legality of transfers. IRS insiders who reviewed a copy of the blueprint said it could result in immigration agents raiding wrong or outdated addresses.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf this program is implemented in its current form, it\u2019s extremely likely that incorrect addresses will be given to DHS and individuals will be wrongly targeted,\u201d said an IRS engineer who examined the blueprints and who, like other officials, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute that ended in De Mello\u2019s ouster was the culmination of months of pressure on the IRS to turn over massive amounts of data in ways that would redefine the relationship between the agency and law enforcement and reduce taxpayers\u2019 privacy, records and interviews show.</p>\n\n<p>In one meeting in late March between senior IRS and DHS officials, a top ICE official made a suggestion: Why doesn\u2019t Homeland Security simply provide the name and state of its targets and have the IRS return the addresses of everyone who matches that criteria?</p>\n\n<p>The IRS lawyers were stunned. They feared they could face criminal liability if they handed over the addresses of individuals who were not under a criminal investigation. The conversation and news of deeper collaboration with ICE so disturbed career staff that it led to a series of departures in late March and early April across the IRS\u2019 legal, IT and privacy offices.</p>\n\n<p>They were \u201cpushing the boundaries of the law,\u201d one official said. \u201cEveryone at IRS felt the same way.\u201d</p>\n\nThe Blueprint\n<p>The technical blueprint obtained by ProPublica shows that engineers at the agency are preparing to give DHS what it wants: a system that enables massive automated data sharing. The goal is to launch the new system before the end of July, two people familiar with the matter said.</p>\n\n<p>The DHS effort to obtain IRS data comes as top immigration enforcement leaders face escalating White House pressure to deport some 3,000 people per day, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ices-tactics-draw-criticism-it-triples-daily-arrest-targets-2025-06-10/\">according to reports</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One federal agent tasked with assisting ICE on deportations said recent operations have been hamstrung by outdated addresses. Better information could dramatically speed up arrests. \u201cSome of the leads that they were giving us were old,\u201d said the agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the press. \u201cThey\u2019re like from two administrations ago.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In early March, immigrants rights groups <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278147/gov.uscourts.dcd.278147.1.0.pdf\">sued the IRS</a> hoping to block the plan, arguing that the memorandum of understanding between DHS and the IRS is illegal. But a judge in early May <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278147/gov.uscourts.dcd.278147.67.0.pdf\">ruled against them</a>, saying the broader agreement complied with Section 6103, the existing law regulating IRS data sharing. That opened the door for engineers to begin building the system.</p>\n\n<p>The judge did not address the technical blueprint, which didn\u2019t exist at the time of the ruling. But the case is pending, which means the new system could still come under legal review.</p>\n\n<p>Until now, little was known about the push and pull between the two agencies or the exact technical mechanics behind the arrangement.</p>\n\n<p>The plan has been shrouded in secrecy even within the IRS, with details of its development withheld from regular communications. Several IRS engineers and lawyers have avoided working on the project out of concerns about personal legal risk.</p>\n\n<p>Asked about the new system, a spokesperson for IRS parent agency the Treasury Department said the memorandum of understanding, often called an MOU, \u201chas been litigated and determined to be a lawful application of Section 6103, which provides for information sharing by the IRS in precise circumstances associated with law enforcement requests.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>At a time when Trump is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366178/trump-deport-jail-u-s-citizens-homegrowns-el-salvador\">making threats</a> to deport not only undocumented immigrants but also U.S. citizens, the scope of information-sharing with the IRS could continue to grow, according to documents reviewed by ProPublica and sources familiar with the matter: DHS has been looking for ways to expand the agreement that could allow Homeland Security officials to seek IRS data on Americans being investigated for various crimes.</p>\n\n<p>Last month, an ICE attorney proposed updating the MOU to authorize new data requests on people \u201cassociated with criminal activities which may include United States citizens or lawful permanent residents,\u201d according to a document seen by ProPublica. The status of this proposal is unclear. De Mello, at the time, rejected it and called for senior Treasury Department leadership to personally sign off on such a significant change.</p>\n\n<p>The White House described DHS\u2019 work with the IRS as a good-faith effort to identify and deport those who are living in the country illegally.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cProPublica continues to degrade their already terrible reputation by suggesting we should turn a blind eye to criminal illegal aliens present in the United States for the sake of trying to collect tax payments from them,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement after receiving questions about the blueprint from ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>She pointed to the April MOU as giving the government the authority to create the new system and added, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a surveillance system. \u2026 It\u2019s part of President Trump\u2019s promise to carry out the mass deportation of criminal illegal aliens \u2014 the promise that the American people elected him on and he is committed to fulfilling.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In a separate statement, a senior DHS official also cited the court\u2019s approval of the MOU, saying that it \u201coutlines a process to ensure that sensitive taxpayer information is protected while allowing law enforcement to effectively pursue criminal violations.\u201d</p>\n\nHow the System Works\n<p>The new system would represent a sea change, allowing law enforcement to request enormous swaths of confidential data in bulk through an automated, computerized process.</p>\n\n<p>The system, according to the blueprint and interviews with IRS engineers, would work like this:</p>\n\n<p>First, DHS would send the IRS a spreadsheet containing the names and previous addresses of the people it\u2019s targeting. The request would include the date of a final removal order, a relevant criminal statute ICE is using to investigate the individual, and the tax period for which information is sought. If DHS fails to include any of this information, the system would reject the request.</p>\n\n<p>The system then attempts to match the information provided by the DHS to a specific taxpayer identification number, which is the primary method by which the IRS identifies an individual in its databases.</p>\n\n<p>If the system makes a match, it accesses the individual\u2019s associated tax file and pulls the address listed during the most recent tax period. Then the system would produce a new spreadsheet enriched with taxpayer data that contains DHS\u2019 targets\u2019 last known addresses. The spreadsheet would include a record of names rejected for lack of required information and names for which it could not make a match.</p>\n\n<p>Tax and privacy experts say they worry about how such a powerful yet crude platform could make dangerous mistakes. Because the search starts with a name instead of a taxpayer identification number, it risks returning the address of an innocent person with the same name as or a similar address to that of one of ICE\u2019s targets. The proposed system assumes the data provided by DHS is accurate and that each targeted individual is the subject of a valid criminal investigation. In effect, the IRS has no way to independently check the bases of these requests, experts told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the blueprint does not limit the amount of data that can be transferred or how often DHS can request it. The system could easily be expanded to acquire all the information the IRS holds on taxpayers, said technical experts and IRS engineers who reviewed the documents. By shifting a single parameter, the program could return more information than just a target\u2019s address, said an engineer familiar with the plan, including employer and familial relationships.</p>\n\n<p>Engineers based at IRS offices in Lanham, Maryland, and Dallas are developing the blueprint.</p>\n\n\u201cGone Back on Its Word\u201d\n<p>For decades, the American government has encouraged everyone who makes an income in the U.S. to pay taxes \u2014 regardless of immigration status \u2014 with an implicit promise that their information would be protected. Now that same data may be used to locate and deport noncitizens.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor years, the IRS has told immigrants that it only cares that they pay their taxes,\u201d said Nandan Joshi, an attorney with the Public Citizen Litigation Group, which is seeking to block the data-sharing agreement in federal court. \u201cBy agreeing to share taxpayer data with ICE on a mass basis, the IRS has gone back on its word.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The push to share IRS data with DHS emerged while Elon Musk\u2019s <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/elon-musk-doge-tracker/\">DOGE</a> reshaped the engineering staff of the IRS. Sam Corcos, a Silicon Valley startup founder with no government experience, pushed out more than 50 IRS engineers and restructured the agency\u2019s engineering priorities while he was the senior DOGE official at the agency. He later became chief information officer at Treasury. He has also led a separate IRS effort to create a master database using products from Silicon Valley giant Palantir Technologies, enabling the government to link and search large swaths of data.</p>\n\n<p>Corcos didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The White House said DOGE is not part of the DHS-IRS pact.</p>\n\n<p>Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance, which oversees the IRS, told ProPublica the system being built was ripe for abuse. It \u201cwould allow an outside agency unprecedented access to IRS records for reasons that have nothing to do with tax administration, opening the door to endless fishing expeditions,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the department\u2019s internal watchdog, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-doge-irs-treasury-tigta-inspector-general-probe\">is already probing efforts by Trump and DOGE</a><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-doge-irs-treasury-tigta-inspector-general-probe\"> </a>to obtain private taxpayer data and other sensitive information, ProPublica reported in April.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration continues to add government agencies to its deportation drive.</p>\n\n<p>DOGE and DHS are also working to build a national citizenship database, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/29/nx-s1-5409608/citizenship-trump-privacy-voting-database\">NPR reported last month</a>. The database links information from the Social Security Administration and the DHS, ostensibly for the purpose of allowing state and local election officials to verify U.S. citizenship.</p>\n\n<p>And in May, a senior Treasury Department official directed 250 IRS criminal investigative agents to help deportation operations, a significant shift for two agencies that historically have had separate missions.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/mac-funk\">McKenzie Funk</a> contributed reporting, and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/kirsten-berg\">Kirsten Berg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/alex-mierjeski\">Alex Mierjeski</a> contributed research.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>\u201cThe most important part right now is that Europe would be able to buy military equipment here in the U.S. so we can donate these military systems directly to Ukraine. That is also discussion going on right now. I think [President] Trump is on the right path here. I think he has promised that would be a possibility. We are talking in these hours about 10 Patriot [missile defense] systems and I think the outcome of that discussion will be that European countries will be able to buy the Patriot systems and then donate them directly to Ukraine and that's important because the discussions two months ago were, in fact, that there were no more to buy here in the U.S. So the outcome of the discussion right now is moving in a better direction.\u201d</p><p>That was Denmark\u2019s Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen, speaking one week ago at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), where he appeared along with Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, Denmark\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs. They discussed not just Ukraine and NATO, but also their relations with the U.S., Greenland, the critical minerals issue and Denmark\u2019s goals in taking over the Presidency of the European Union (EU) for the next six months.</p><p>The two had been in Washington for several days of meeting with senior Trump officials, and Members of Congress, in part because Denmark has assumed the Presidency of the European Union and plans to make military preparedness a hallmark of the country\u2019s six month leadership term.</p><p>Last Tuesday, Poulsen explained the reasoning for European nations to buy weapons from the U.S. for Ukraine, which Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte announced at the White House yesterday. He and Rasmussen also explained the background of the European nations\u2019 decision-making as well as their views of activities here in Washington and the rest of the world.</p><p>Foreign Minister Rasmussen gave his own assessment of the situation in Moscow, saying, \u201cYou shouldn't overestimate the power of Russia. I mean we have weakened the [Russian] economy. They are now on a war footing so to speak. They spend more on military than in health and education and everything civilized combined. They have huge casualties, high inflation. I mean if it was a more open transparent society with some kind of internal discussions, things would have been very, very, different. If you compare the casualties with what they lost in Afghanistan and decided to withdraw, it's much worse.\u201d</p><p>A former two-time Danish Prime Minister, Rasmussen continued, \u201cBut of course it's a closed society and it is a one-man-takes-all-decisions-kind-of-society. It's not a democracy, but it is within our hands, so to speak, to actually crash Putin and his war machine.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen then added, \u201cThe big question is whether we [Denmark and the other NATO and EU countries] have, you know, the readiness, the willingness to do so, and here of course we need the U.S. I mean it goes without saying that Europe has to pay a bigger part of the bill. We do. We [Europe] now account for like 70% of the total support to Ukraine. That number will go up, but we need the U.S. on board as well, not least when we are talking sanctions and pressure on Putin.\u201d</p><p>As Rasmussen pointed out, tiny Denmark supplies quite a bit by itself. \u201cWe are the fourth biggest contributor to Ukraine,\u201d he said, \u201cso it's like U.S., U.K. [United Kingdom], Germany, and then Denmark. Per capita, we are so far the biggest. We spend like plus 1,500 Euros [$1,754] per capita in Denmark. It's more than the double compared to the second biggest spender in Europe.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

So that's my main objective to be here [in Washington].\u201d</p><p>Poulsen added, \u201cTrump is quite much aware of that. And also [Defense Secretary] Pete Hegseth and [Secretary of State] Mario Rubio [both of whom they had met with]. They are aware that they have to speed up all these processes \u2014 too much red tape in delivering to Europe. And when we are coming to U.S. saying we would like to buy even more military equipment, then I don't think the answer should be you have to wait seven or eight years to get it.\u201d</p><p>Poulsen also said, \u201cEurope will do more and I think the outcome of the situation in Ukraine is also the demanding question for Europe to be able to invest more and also build up more [military] capacity,\u201d which he described as among the \u201clessons learned from Ukraine.\u201d</p><p>At one point Rasmussen said he had met briefly with Trump during the June NATO meeting at The Hague. \u201cI told him when we met last time when I was prime minister, we only spent like 1.5 percent [of the nation\u2019s GDP] in Denmark [for our defense spending]\u2026Then the whole thing happened in Ukraine. Now there's totally new sense of urgency. This year Denmark spends 3.2 percent, exactly the same as U.S. It is a clear commitment from our government that we will meet the 3.5 percent [NATO goal by 2035].\u201d</p><p>Ukraine has shown itself to be very strong in creating new and innovative defense companies, they both said, but investment in arms manufacturing outside Ukraine is what they talked about. Rasmussen said, \u201cBasically it's about buying from Ukraine to Ukraine.\u201d </p><p><span></span>He described that when the war started Ukraine had a weapons industry of some $3 billion, but it is now up to $40 billion, although Ukrainians \u201conly have finance for half of it.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen said an answer has been that \u201cwe [the Danes] have spent our own money and we also have the honor to be the facilitator of some of these [Russian] frozen assets or the interest linked to the frozen asset. So that is the basis of the Danish model and now we are working on making, you know, real investments\u2026with our Ukrainian friends to set up Ukrainian investments in Denmark to give them some kind of safe haven.\u201d</p><p>Other European countries have followed, and together with the Ukrainians they are producing arms not just for Ukraine, but for their own militaries. \u201cWe should be inspired of what the Ukrainians lesson learned from their battlefield,\u201d Rasmussen said, \u201cand that's why it makes sense also to invest not only to assist them [Ukrainians], but also to make some kind of technology transferring from Ukraine to our own military.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><em>Sign up today</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Poulsen said the first pilot project was last July, when Denmark paid for 18 Bohdana self-propelled 155 mm howitzers that Ukraine had created on its own. \u201cThey were produced in two months,\u201d Poulsen said. \u201cShould we have been able to buy them in Europe, it will have taken two years. So in two months they were able to produce the Bohdana systems. It was very cheap and the spare parts, the maintenance, all that kind of thing are, of course, being done directly near the front line. So it has been a huge success and right now we're looking into also developing new capabilities or finance new capabilities for the defense companies in Ukraine. That would be missiles, that would be drones. It's under Ukrainian defense demands that they ask for this and we reimburse [pay for] the contracts.\u201d</p><p>With some $20 billion from Europeans and others available, Poulsen explained, \u201cthe best way we can do for our friends in Ukraine to keep up fighting is in fact to give money directly into the [Ukraine] defense companies.\u201d</p><p>Poulsen called it Danish model 2.0. and said, \u201cThat's to invite some of the [Ukraine] defense companies to have a safe haven in Denmark to produce what they will need in Ukraine, hopefully all also in Germany and other European countries.\u201d</p><p>Poulsen also described a new approach involving Denmark, Germany and Nordic countries \u2014 jointly buying weapons systems.</p><p>As an example, Poulsen said that Denmark, Norway and Sweden are looking into buying the P-8A Poseidon U.S. Navy multi-mission maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft. He said it was a capability they already have in Norway and Germany, but \u201cnot buying it ourselves [individually]\u2026we'll also have some capabilities that we could use together with Sweden and Norway\u2026So that will be the way forward.\u201d</p><p>As for Greenland, Rasmussen said he did not really discuss the matter in any depth when he met with Rubio because \u201cwe [the Danes] have the slogan \u2018nothing about Greenland without Greenland [being present].\u2019 Even though the foreign security policy [of Greenland] is, you know, the Danish government's responsibility, we have developed a good tradition or custom that if we are, you know, really negotiating with the third countries about these issues we will have our Greenlandic colleague [with us].\u201d</p><p>Greenland, he said, was discussed \u201cin a more generally way.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen said the Danes were \u201ctaken by surprise\u201d by Trump\u2019s announcement that for both U.S. national security and international security it was necessary that Washington annex Greenland.</p><p>Rasmussen, who was Danish Prime Minister from 2016-to-2019 during Trump\u2019s first term, said, \u201cI have experienced with Trump so many times that whatever he says\u2026and whatever he proposes there's always some kind of rational substance behind it. I mean, and we share the view, that we have to be present in the Arctic in a different way. But it shouldn't be in a fight between the kingdom of Denmark and U.S. It should be by combining forces and we have the framework for that.\u201d</p><p>He explained that the Danes \u201chave been pushing for including [the] Arctic in the capability targets in NATO. And, to some extent, we were successful. There's now a kind of principal agreement among the NATO Arctic countries, including U.S., that this is something we should do under the framework of the NATO.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen added, \u201cSo it's not that the Greenlandic issue is solved. I think because apart from these rational arguments, I can't get rid of the idea that there's also just this [Trump] vision of creating a bigger U.S. and we can, of course, not accommodate that.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen added, \u201cI must say I leave Washington a bit more optimistic compared to when I arrived. I think the statement made by the president [Trump] after his [most recent] telephone conversations with [Russian President] Putin and [Ukraine President] Zelensky prove that he now to a larger extent share our analysis of the situation. I mean it was a bit confusing earlier this year when he had Zelensky in the Oval Office who is the bad guy, who is the good guy. That has shifted. I think the [Hague] NATO summit was also important. I mean I really feel and think he [Trump] has perhaps the most positive view on Europe he has had for a while, at least.\u201d</p><p>All that has turned out to have been realistic. Let\u2019s hope Trump stays on his current trajectory.</p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

Some are former military personnel with little coding experience who are paid barely more than minimum wage for the work.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trusting that what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t malicious, but we really can\u2019t tell,\u201d said one current escort who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, fearing professional repercussions. </p>\n\n<p>The system has been in place for nearly a decade, though its existence is being reported publicly here for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft told ProPublica that it has disclosed details about the escort model to the federal government. But former government officials said in interviews that they had never heard of digital escorts. The program appears to be so low-profile that even the Defense Department\u2019s IT agency had difficulty finding someone familiar with it. \u201cLiterally no one seems to know anything about this, so I don\u2019t know where to go from here,\u201d said Deven King, spokesperson for the Defense Information Systems Agency. </p>\n\n<p>National security and cybersecurity experts contacted by ProPublica were also surprised to learn that such an arrangement was in place, especially at a time when the U.S. intelligence community and leading members of Congress and the Trump administration view China\u2019s digital prowess as a top threat to the country.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2024-Unclassified-Report.pdf\">Office of the Director of National Intelligence has called China</a> the \u201cmost active and persistent cyber threat to U.S. Government, private-sector, and critical infrastructure networks.\u201d One of the most prominent examples of that threat came in 2023, when Chinese hackers infiltrated the cloud-based mailboxes of senior U.S. government officials, stealing data and emails from the commerce secretary, the U.S. ambassador to China and others working on national security matters. The intruders <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-03/CSRBReviewOfTheSummer2023MEOIntrusion508.pdf\">downloaded about 60,000 emails</a> from the State Department alone.</p>\n\n<p>With President Donald Trump and his allies concerned about spying, the State Department announced plans in May to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/05/new-visa-policies-put-america-first-not-china/\">aggressively revoke visas</a> for Chinese students\u201d \u2014 a pledge that <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114664632971715644\">the president seems to have walked back</a>. The administration is also trying to arrange the sale of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/30/tech/trump-tiktok-who-could-buy\">the popular social media platform TikTok</a>, which is owned by a Chinese company that some lawmakers believe could hand over sensitive U.S. user data to Beijing and fuel misinformation with its content recommendations. But experts told ProPublica that digital escorting poses a far greater threat to national security than either of those issues and is a natural opportunity for spies.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf I were an operative, I would look at that as an avenue for extremely valuable access. We need to be very concerned about that,\u201d said <a href=\"https://commerce.maryland.gov/commerce/harry-coker-jr\">Harry Coker</a>, who was a senior executive at the CIA and the National Security Agency. Coker, who also was national cyber director during the Biden administration, added that he and his former intelligence community colleagues \u201cwould love to have had access like that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It is difficult to know whether engineers overseen by digital escorts have ever carried out a cyberattack against the U.S. government. But Coker wondered whether it \u201ccould be part of an explanation for a lot of the challenges we have faced over the years.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft uses the escort system to handle the government\u2019s most sensitive information that falls below \u201cclassified.\u201d According to the government, this <a href=\"https://www.fedramp.gov/understanding-baselines-and-impact-levels/#:~:text=High%20Impact%20data%20is%20usually,services%20across%20the%20federal%20government.\">\u201chigh impact level\u201d category includes \u201cdata that involves</a> the protection of life and financial ruin.\u201d The \u201closs of confidentiality, integrity, or availability\u201d of this information \u201ccould be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect\u201d on operations, assets and individuals, the government has said. In the Defense Department, the data is categorized as \u201cImpact Level\u201d 4 and 5 and includes materials that directly support military operations. </p>\n\n<p>John Sherman, who was <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/2881098/john-sherman/\">chief information officer</a> for the Department of Defense during the Biden administration, said he was surprised and concerned to learn of ProPublica\u2019s findings. \u201cI probably should have known about this,\u201d he said. He told the news organization that the situation warrants a \u201cthorough review by DISA, Cyber Command and other stakeholders that are involved in this.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In an emailed statement, the Defense Information Systems Agency said that cloud service providers \u201care required to establish and maintain controls for vetting and using qualified specialists,\u201d but the agency did not respond to ProPublica\u2019s questions regarding the digital escorts\u2019 qualifications.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s unclear whether other cloud providers to the federal government use digital escorts as part of their tech support. Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud declined to comment on the record for this article. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft declined to make executives available for interviews for this article. In response to emailed questions, the company provided a statement saying its personnel and contractors operate in a manner \u201cconsistent with US Government requirements and processes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Global workers \u201chave no direct access to customer data or customer systems,\u201d the statement said. Escorts \u201cwith the appropriate clearances and training provide direct support. These personnel are provided specific training on protecting sensitive data, preventing harm, and use of the specific commands/controls within the environment.\u201d In addition, Microsoft said it has an internal review process known as \u201cLockbox\u201d to \u201cmake sure the request is deemed safe or has any cause for concern.\u201d A company spokesperson declined to provide specifics about how it works but said it\u2019s built into the system and involves review by a Microsoft employee in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>Over the years, various people involved in the work, including a Microsoft cybersecurity leader, warned the company that the arrangement is inherently risky, those people told ProPublica. Despite the presence of an escort, foreign engineers are privy to granular details about the federal cloud \u2014 the kind of information hackers could exploit. Moreover, the U.S. escorts overseeing these workers are ill equipped to spot suspicious activity, two of the people said.</p>\n\n<p>Even those who helped develop the escort system acknowledge the people doing the work may not be able to detect problems.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf someone ran a script called \u2018fix_servers.sh\u2019 but it actually did something malicious then [escorts] would have no idea,\u201d Matthew Erickson, a former Microsoft engineer who worked on the escort system, told ProPublica in an email. That said, he maintained that the \u201cscope of systems they could disrupt\u201d is limited.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    <p>The Defense Department requires anyone working with its most sensitive data to be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national or permanent resident. \u201cNo Foreign persons may have such access,\u201d according to the department\u2019s cloud security requirements. Microsoft, however, has a global workforce, so it created the digital escort system as a work-around. Here\u2019s an example of how it works and the risk it poses:</p>\n<p>Tech support is needed on a Microsoft cloud product.\n  </p>\n<p>A Microsoft engineer in China files an online \u201cticket\u201d to take on the work.\n  </p>\n<p>A U.S.-based escort picks up the ticket.\n</p>\n<p>The engineer and the escort meet on the Microsoft Teams conferencing platform.\n</p>\n<p>The engineer sends computer commands to the U.S. escort, presenting an opportunity to insert malicious code.\n</p>\n<p>The escort, who may not have advanced technical expertise, inputs the commands into the federal cloud system.\n</p>\n<p><em>Illustrations for ProPublica</em></p>\n\n\n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>A Microsoft contractor called Insight Global <a href=\"https://jobs.insightglobal.com/find_a_job/washington/job-331977/\">posted an ad in January</a> seeking an escort to bring engineers without security clearances \u201cinto the secured environment\u201d of the federal government and to \u201cprotect confidential and secure information from spillage,\u201d an industry term for a data leak. The pay started at $18 an hour.</p>\n\n<p>While the ad said that specific technical skills were \u201chighly preferred\u201d and \u201cnice to have,\u201d the main prerequisite was possessing a valid \u201csecret\u201d level clearance issued by the Defense Department.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPeople are getting these jobs because they are cleared, not because they\u2019re software engineers,\u201d said the escort who agreed to speak anonymously and who works for Insight Global.</p>\n\n<p>Each month, the company\u2019s roughly 50-person escort team fields hundreds of interactions with Microsoft\u2019s China-based engineers and developers, inputting those workers\u2019 commands into federal networks, the employee said. </p>\n\n<p>In a statement to ProPublica, Insight Global said it \u201cevaluates the technical capabilities of each resource throughout the interview process to ensure they possess the technical skills required\u201d for the job, and provides training. The company noted that escorts also receive additional cyber and \u201cinsider threat awareness\u201d training as part of the government security clearance process.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhile a security clearance may be required for the role, it is but one piece of the puzzle,\u201d the company said. </p>\n\n<p>Microsoft did not respond to questions about Insight Global.</p>\n\n\u201cThe Path of Least Resistance\u201d\n<p>When modern cloud technology emerged in the 2000s, offering on-demand computing power and data storage via the internet, it ushered in fundamental changes to federal government operations. </p>\n\n<p>For decades, federal departments used computer servers owned and operated by the government itself to house data and power networks. Shifting to the cloud meant moving that work to massive off-site data centers managed by tech companies. </p>\n\n<p>Federal officials believed that the cloud would provide greater power, efficiency and cost savings. But the transition also meant that the government would cede some control over who maintained and accessed its information to companies like Microsoft, whose employees would take over tasks previously handled by federal IT workers. </p>\n\n<p>To address the risks of this revolution, the government <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220210115924/https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/assets/egov_docs/fedrampmemo.pdf\">started the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program</a>, known as FedRAMP, in 2011. Under the program, companies that wanted to sell their cloud services to the government had to establish how they would ensure that personnel working with sensitive federal data would have the requisite \u201caccess authorizations\u201d and background screenings. On top of that, the Defense Department had its own cloud guidelines, requiring that people handling sensitive data be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. </p>\n\n<p>This presented an issue for Microsoft, given its reliance on a vast global workforce, with significant operations in India, China and the European Union. So the company tapped a senior program manager named Indy Crowley to put federal officials at ease. Known for his familiarity with the rules and his ability to converse in the government\u2019s acronym-heavy lingo, colleagues dubbed him the \u201cFedRAMP whisperer.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In an interview, Crowley told ProPublica that he appealed directly to FedRAMP leadership, arguing that the relative risk from Microsoft\u2019s global workforce was minimal. To make his point, he said he once grilled a FedRAMP official on the provenance of code in products supplied by other government vendors such as IBM. The official couldn\u2019t say with certainty that only U.S. citizens had worked on the product in question, he said. The cloud, Crowley argued, should not be treated any differently.</p>\n\n<p>Crowley said he also met with prospective customers across the government and told ProPublica that the Defense Department was the \u201cone making the most demands.\u201d Concerned about the company\u2019s global workforce, officials there asked him who from Microsoft would be \u201cbehind the curtain\u201d working on the cloud. Given the department\u2019s citizenship requirements, the officials raised the possibility of Microsoft \u201chiring a bunch of U.S. citizens to maintain the federal cloud\u201d directly, Crowley told ProPublica. For Microsoft, the suggestion was a nonstarter, Crowley said, because the increased labor costs of implementing it broadly would make a cloud transition prohibitively expensive for the government.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always a balance between cost and level of effort and expertise,\u201d he told ProPublica. \u201cSo you find what\u2019s good enough.\u201d Hiring virtual escorts to supervise Microsoft\u2019s foreign workforce emerged as \u201cthe path of least resistance,\u201d Crowley said.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft did not respond to ProPublica\u2019s questions about Crowley\u2019s account.</p>\n\n<p>When he brought the concept back to Microsoft, colleagues had mixed reactions. Tom Keane, then the corporate vice president for Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform, Azure, embraced the idea, according to a former employee involved in the discussions, as it would allow the company to scale up. But that former employee, who was involved in cybersecurity strategy, told ProPublica they opposed the concept, viewing it as too risky from a security perspective. Both Keane and Crowley dismissed the concerns, said the former employee, who left the company before the escort concept was deployed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPeople who got in the way of scaling up did not stay,\u201d the former employee told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>Crowley said he did not recall the discussion. Keane did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>On its march to becoming one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, Microsoft has repeatedly prioritized corporate profit over customer security, ProPublica has found. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/microsoft-solarwinds-golden-saml-data-breach-russian-hackers\">the news organization reported</a> that the tech giant ignored one of its own engineers when he repeatedly warned that a product flaw left the U.S. government exposed; state-sponsored Russian hackers later exploited that weakness in one of the largest cyberattacks in history. Microsoft has defended its decision not to address the flaw, saying that it received \u201cmultiple reviews\u201d and that the company weighs a variety of factors when making security decisions.</p>\n\nA Skills Gap From the Start\n<p>The idea of an escort wasn\u2019t novel. The <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final\">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>, which serves as the federal government\u2019s standards-setting body, had established recommendations on how IT maintenance should be performed on-site, such as in a restricted government office. \u201cMaintenance personnel that lack appropriate security clearances or are not U.S. citizens\u201d must be escorted and supervised by \u201capproved organizational personnel who are fully cleared, have appropriate access authorizations, and are technically qualified,\u201d the guidelines state.</p>\n\n<p>The government <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r4/upd3/final\">at the time</a> specified the intent of the recommendation: to deny \u201cindividuals who lack appropriate security clearances ... or who are not U.S. citizens, visual and electronic access to\u201d sensitive government information.</p>\n\n<p>But escorts in the cloud wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to meet that goal, given the gap in technical expertise between them and the Microsoft counterparts they would be taking direction from.</p>\n\n<p>That imbalance, though, was baked into the escorting model.</p>\n\n<p>Erickson, the former Microsoft engineer who worked on the model, told ProPublica that escorts are \u201csomewhat technically proficient,\u201d but mainly are \u201cjust there to make sure the employees don\u2019t accidentally or intentionally view\u201d passwords, customer data or personally identifiable information. \u201cIf there are problems with the underlying\u201d cloud services, \u201cthen only the people who work on those services at Microsoft would have the requisite knowledge to fix it,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Advanced threats from foreign adversaries weren\u2019t on the radar for Erickson, who said he didn\u2019t \u201chave any reason to suspect someone more just based on their country of origin.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any extra threat from Microsoft employees based in other countries,\u201d he said.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n    \n            (Illustration by Andrea Wise/ProPublica. Source images: Bevan Goldswain/Getty Images, kontekbrothers/Getty Images, amgun/Getty Images.)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Pradeep Nair, a former Microsoft vice president who said he helped develop the concept from the start, said that the digital escort strategy allowed the company to \u201cgo to market faster,\u201d positioning it to win major federal cloud contracts. He said that escorts \u201ccomplete role-specific training before touching any production system\u201d and that a variety of safeguards including audit logs, the digital trail of system activity, could alert Microsoft or the government to potential problems. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cBecause these controls are stringent, residual risk is minimal,\u201d Nair said.</p>\n\n<p>But legal and cybersecurity experts say such assumptions ignored the massive cyber threat from China in particular. Around the time that Microsoft was developing its escort strategy, an attack attributed to Chinese state-sponsored hackers resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/us/office-of-personnel-management-hackers-got-data-of-millions.html\">largest breach</a> of U.S. government data up to that point. The theft initially targeted a government contractor and eventually compromised the personal information of <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/exclusive-25-million-affected-opm-hack-sources/story?id=32332731\">more than 22 million people</a>, most of them applicants for federal security clearances.</p>\n\n<p>Chinese laws allow government officials there to collect data \u201cas long as they\u2019re doing something that they\u2019ve deemed legitimate,\u201d said <a href=\"https://law.yale.edu/jeremy-l-daum\">Jeremy Daum, senior research fellow</a> at the Paul Tsai China Center at Yale Law School. Microsoft\u2019s China-based tech support for the U.S. government presents an opening for espionage, \u201cwhether it be putting someone who\u2019s already an intelligence professional into one of those jobs, or going to the people who are in the jobs and pumping them for information,\u201d Daum said. \u201cIt would be difficult for any Chinese citizen or company to meaningfully resist a direct request from security forces or law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Erickson acknowledged that having an escort doesn\u2019t prevent foreign developers \u201cfrom doing \u2018bad\u2019 things. It just allows for there to be a recording and a witness.\u201d He said if an escort suspects malicious activity, they will end the session and file an incident report to investigate further.</p>\n\n<p>How much of this information federal officials understood is unclear.</p>\n\n<p>A Microsoft spokesperson said the company described the digital escort model in the documents submitted to the government as part of cloud vendor authorization processes. However, it declined to provide those records or to tell ProPublica the exact language it used in them to describe the escort arrangement, citing the potential security risk of publicly disclosing it.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to a third-party auditor, Microsoft\u2019s documentation theoretically would have been reviewed by multiple parties in the government, including FedRAMP and DISA. DISA said the materials are \u201cnot releasable to the public.\u201d The General Services Administration, which houses FedRAMP, did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\nThe \u201cRight Eyes\u201d for the Job?\n<p>In June 2016, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/blog/government/2016/06/23/fedramp-confirms-high-compliance-status-microsoft-cloud-government/\">Microsoft announced that it had received FedRAMP authorization</a> to work with some of the government\u2019s most sensitive data. Matt Goodrich, then FedRAMP director, said at the time that the accreditation was \u201ca testament to Microsoft\u2019s ability to meet the government\u2019s rigorous security requirements.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Around the same time, Microsoft put the escort concept into practice, engaging contacts from defense giant Lockheed Martin to hire cloud escorts, two people involved in the contract told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>A project manager, who asked for anonymity to describe confidential discussions, told ProPublica that they were skeptical of the escort arrangement from the start and voiced those feelings to their Microsoft counterpart. The manager was especially concerned that the new hires would not have the \u201cright eyes\u201d for the job given the relatively low pay set by Microsoft, but the system went ahead anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Lockheed Martin referred questions to Leidos, a company that took over Lockheed\u2019s IT business following a merger in 2016. Leidos declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p>As Microsoft captured more of the government\u2019s business, the company turned to additional subcontractors, typically staffing companies, to hire more digital escorts. </p>\n\n<p>Analyzing profiles on LinkedIn, ProPublica identified at least two such firms: Insight Global and ASM Research, whose parent company is consulting giant Accenture. While the scope of each firm\u2019s business with Microsoft is unclear, ProPublica found more workers identifying themselves as digital escorts at Insight Global, many of them former military personnel, than at ASM. ASM and Accenture did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\nConcerns About China\n<p>Some Insight Global workers recognized the same problem as the former Lockheed manager: a mismatch in skills between the U.S.-based escorts and the Microsoft engineers they are supervising. The engineers might briefly describe the job to be completed \u2014 for instance, updating a firewall, installing an update to fix a bug or reviewing logs to troubleshoot a problem. Then, with limited inspection, the escort copies and pastes the engineer\u2019s commands into the federal cloud.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re telling nontechnical people very technical directions,\u201d the current Insight Global escort said, adding that the arrangement presents untold opportunities for hacking. As an example, they said the engineer could install an update allowing an outsider to access the network.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWill that get caught? Absolutely,\u201d the escort told ProPublica. \u201cWill that get caught before damage is done? No idea.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The escort was particularly concerned about the dozens of tickets a week filed by workers based in China. The attack targeting federal officials in 2023 \u2014 in which Chinese hackers stole 60,000 emails \u2014 underscored that fear.</p>\n\n<p>The federal Cyber Safety Review Board, which investigated the attack, blamed Microsoft for security lapses that gave hackers their opening. Its <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/CSRB-Review-Summer-2023-MEO-Intrusion\">published report</a> did not mention digital escorts, either as playing a role in the attack or as a risk to be mitigated. Sherman, the former chief information officer for the Defense Department, and Coker, the former intelligence official, who both also served as members of the CSRB, told ProPublica that they did not recall the board ever discussing digital escorting, which they said they now consider a major threat. The Trump administration has since disbanded the CSRB.</p>\n\n<p>In its statement, Microsoft said it expects escorts \u201cto perform a variety of technical tasks,\u201d which are outlined in its contracts with vendors. Insight Global said it evaluates prospective hires to ensure they have those skills and trains new employees on \u201call applicable security and compliance policies provided by Microsoft.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But the Insight Global employee told ProPublica the training regimen doesn\u2019t come close to bridging the knowledge gap. In addition, it is challenging for escorts to gain expertise on the job because the type of work they oversee varies widely. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to get as trained up as you need to be on the wide array of things you need to look at,\u201d they said. </p>\n\n<p>The escort said they repeatedly raised concerns about the knowledge gap to Microsoft, over several years and as recently as April, and to Insight Global\u2019s own attorneys. They said the digital escorts\u2019 relative inexperience \u2014 combined with Chinese laws that grant the country\u2019s officials broad authority to collect data \u2014 left U.S. government networks overly exposed. Microsoft repeatedly thanked the escort for raising the issues while Insight Global said it would take them under advisement, the escort said. It is unclear whether Microsoft or Insight Global took any steps to address them; neither company answered questions about the escort\u2019s account.</p>\n\n<p>In its statement, Microsoft said it meets regularly with its contractors \u201cto discuss operations and surface questions or concerns.\u201d The company also noted that it has additional layers of \u201csecurity and monitoring controls\u201d including \u201cautomated code reviews to quickly detect and prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMicrosoft assumes anyone that has access to production systems, regardless of location or role, can pose a risk to the system, whether intentionally or unintentionally,\u201d the company said in its statement.</p>\n\nAnother Warning, a Growing Risk\n<p>Last year, about three months after government investigators released <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/CSRB-Review-Summer-2023-MEO-Intrusion\">their report</a> on the 2023 hack into U.S. officials\u2019 emails, a former Insight Global contractor named Tom Schiller contacted a Defense Department hotline and wrote to several federal lawmakers to warn them about digital escorting. He had become familiar with the system while briefly working for the company as a software developer. By last July, Schiller\u2019s complaints wound their way to the Defense Information Systems Agency Office of the Inspector General. Schiller told ProPublica that the office conducted a sworn interview with him, and separately with three others connected to Insight Global. In August, the inspector general wrote to Schiller to say it had closed the case.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe conducted a preliminary analysis into the complaint and determined this matter is not within the avenue of redress by DISA IG and is best addressed by the appropriate DISA management,\u201d the assistant inspector general for investigations said in the letter. \u201cWe have referred the information you provided to management.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for the inspector general \u2014 whose office is supposed to operate independently in order to investigate potential waste, fraud and abuse \u2014 told ProPublica they were not authorized to speak about the issue and directed questions to DISA public affairs.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf the public information office contacts me and wants to collaborate to formulate a response through their office, I\u2019ll be more than happy to do that,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cBut I will not be responding to any kind of media request concerning OIG business without speaking with the public information office.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>DISA public affairs did not answer questions about the matter. After a spokesperson initially said that he couldn\u2019t find anyone who had heard of the escort concept, the agency later acknowledged in a statement to ProPublica that escorts are used \u201cin select unclassified environments\u201d at the Defense Department for \u201cadvanced problem diagnosis and resolution from industry subject matter experts.\u201d Echoing Microsoft\u2019s statement, it continued, \u201cExperts under escort supervision have no direct, hands-on access to government systems; but rather offer guidance and recommendations to authorized administrators who perform tasks.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It is unclear what, if any, discussions have taken place among Microsoft, Insight Global and DISA, or any other government agency, regarding digital escorts.</p>\n\n<p>But David Mihelcic, DISA\u2019s former chief technology officer, said any visibility into the Defense Department\u2019s network poses a \u201chuge risk.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHere you have one person you really don\u2019t trust because they\u2019re probably in the Chinese intelligence service, and the other person is not really capable,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>The risk may be getting more serious by the day, as U.S.-China relations worsen amid a simmering trade war \u2014 the type of conflict that <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/10/trade_war_reaches_cyberspace/\">experts say</a> could result in Chinese cyber retaliation.</p>\n\n<p>In testimony to a Senate committee in May, Microsoft President Brad Smith said the company is continually \u201cpushing Chinese out of agencies.\u201d He did not elaborate on how they got in, and Microsoft did not respond to follow-up questions on the remark.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>Today, after a post-9/11 era defined by global counterterrorism and asymmetric warfare, the U.S. is preparing for potential near-peer conflicts amid an era of great power competition that is complicated by disruptive technologies. In response, a new wave of defense contractors is emerging from the epicenter of American technological innovation: Silicon Valley. These companies are addressing critical technology gaps in areas such as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, space services, cyber operations, and small drones. They're deploying cutting-edge solutions to fill capability shortfalls that the U.S. government has acknowledged exist\u2014and they\u2019re scaling fast. Winning high-profile contracts, these companies are reshaping how the Pentagon engages with the private sector.</p><p>Among those in the defense tech industry, there\u2019s been growing chatter about the rise of these defense disruptors\u2014what you might call the <em><em>neoprimes</em></em>. We\u2014one of us a technology investor, the other a former portfolio manager at the Department of Defense\u2019s Defense Innovation Unit\u2014are often asked:<em><em> Is the rise of neoprimes real? What exactly is a neoprime? What defines one? </em></em>We set out to answer those questions, using data to support our observations. We believe neoprimes are changing the culture of defense acquisitions and developing technologies that will reshape how wars are fought. Shifts in defense spending and policy are empowering neoprimes to grow and move faster.</p><p>To understand how we got here, we can revisit a pivotal 1993 meeting now known as the \u201cLast Supper.\u201d Following the end of the Cold War, U.S. defense spending plummeted, prompting a major drawdown. The Department of Defense faced intense pressure to cut costs, with budgets falling by about 30%\u2014from, adjusted for inflation, $772 billion in 1989 to roughly $531 billion by 1998. Against this backdrop, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense William Perry convened a critical meeting, the \u201cLast Supper,\u201d with executives from the top defense contractors. His message was clear: the Pentagon could no longer sustain a sprawling ecosystem of dozens of major firms, and consolidation was inevitable. The industry responded accordingly\u2014over 50 companies merged into the five dominant primes we know today. These survivors\u2014Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics\u2014became massive, vertically integrated organizations that controlled roughly 60% of Department of Defense contracts by 2000. For decades, these primes dominated government contract spending to build and sustain the nation's security apparatus, supported by a vast web of partners and subcontractors. But with predictable, annual funding streams and limited competitive pressure, innovation within these primes arguably stagnated.</p><p><span></span>While many of these traditional primes trace their roots back over a century, a new tribe of Silicon Valley players has entered the arena. They are accelerating deployment timelines and pioneering a different model\u2014defined by rapid iteration, software-first architectures, and a greater appetite for risk. They're deploying operational systems in months rather than years or decades. They\u2019re not just building prototypes for demos and exercises\u2014they\u2019re scaling production and securing billion-dollar contracts. While they may not yet match the traditional primes in total contract volume, they are closing the gap year over year. A handful of key firms are leading the charge, with an expanding set of startups gaining traction. Backed by venture capital and supported by a growing network of influential advocates shaping policy and public opinion, neoprimes are starting to redefine how the government approaches the acquisition, fielding, and sustainment of new technologies. They are becoming mission-critical to the defense industrial base of America.</p><p>As this new generation of defense contractors gains momentum, what exactly is a neoprime? To answer that, we analyzed data from USAspending.gov (the federal government\u2019s official platform for tracking public expenditures), reviewed SEC filings from public defense companies, and compiled press releases from private firms. We also interviewed founders and venture capitalists focused on national security innovation.</p><p>Through this research, we identified several defining characteristics of neoprimes and emerging market trends. Our analysis focuses on a set of current neoprimes\u2014SpaceX, Palantir, and Anduril Industries\u2014alongside a cohort of rising companies like Shield AI, Skydio, Saildrone, Saronic, Hidden Level, Epirus, Relativity Space, Axiom Space, HawkEye 360, Vannevar Labs, and others. These companies are beginning to lead major defense programs with advanced technologies and a fundamentally different approach to speed, software integration, and delivery.</p><p>Below, we outline our findings and define the characteristics that distinguish neoprimes. We believe these companies represent the future of national security\u2014and to preserve America\u2019s strategic edge, we must rapidly adopt and scale their solutions across the defense industrial base.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Join us in Sea Island, Georgia for The Cipher Brief's </em><a href=\"https://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em>2025 Threat Conference</em></u></a><em> from October 19-22.

In recent years, the Department of Defense has formally emphasized the importance of these technologies, identifying fourteen Critical Technology Areas that reflect a growing urgency to catch up with and surpass global competitors. </p><p>To better understand this trend, we evaluated the top five most commonly used Product Service Codes (PSCs) for a set of government contractors from 2018 to 2023. PSCs are used by the U.S. federal government to describe the products, services, and research being purchased through contracts, and we gathered this data from USAspending.gov\u2019s contract award summaries by vendor. For Palantir, SpaceX, and Anduril, we then identified the most popular PSCs across all three. We performed the same analysis to determine the top PSCs among the traditional defense primes\u2014Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics. </p><p>Palantir's top PSCs were predominantly in the information technology category, consistent with their core strength in data platforms and software integration. Most of the PSCs associated with Anduril were concentrated in engineering services. </p><p>In contrast, for traditional primes such as General Dynamics, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon, the most common PSCs were heavily concentrated in hardware categories\u2014covering items like airframe structural components, helicopter rotor blades, and shock absorbers. Compared to newer entrants, their portfolios featured far fewer PSCs related to software or IT services.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fa6d7\" src=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.png?id=61219053&amp;width=980\" /> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Neoprimes are also focused on interoperability. Traditional contractors are notorious for proprietary systems that require their own unique control systems and limited third-party integrations\u2014like drones that can only be operated with specific controllers, computers, or field kits. But proprietary everything doesn't scale on a battlefield increasingly filled with robots, sensors, and drones, especially as soldiers are limited by the number of control systems they can carry into the field. In contrast, neoprimes are designing software with interoperability in mind from the start\u2014built to integrate seamlessly with legacy systems and ingest any data the government allows.</p><p>Overall, the solutions neoprimes are developing are especially relevant today, as many Cold War-era tools are failing to scale to the demands of the modern battlefield. For example, Ukrainian soldiers are now using low-cost drones to disable expensive Russian platforms\u2014in the recent Spider's Web operation, 117 drones struck four Russian military airbases and targeted at least 40 warplanes. The operation dealt a significant asymmetric blow to the Russian military and broader economy, with estimated losses reaching up to $7 billion. The inevitable shift toward more affordable, more attritable platforms is forcing governments to rethink how they develop and fund major defense systems. Neoprimes and the Department of Defense are racing to develop low cost-to-kill technologies\u2014while also developing defenses against them\u2014as these small lethal platforms become increasingly common on modern battlefields around the world.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Sign up for the </strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>Cyber Initiatives Group</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

We have observed that these companies don't necessarily wait for the Department of Defense to fund their R&amp;D instead, they develop solutions they believe are obvious answers to current pressing problems and find ways to get them into the hands of warfighters\u2014often well before any large procurement orders have even been placed. </p><p>These companies will send prototypes \"downrange\" with willing servicemembers, sometimes years before more formal procurement contracts materialize. Shield AI, for example, deployed working prototypes of their AI-enabled drones to Special Operations Forces in combat in the Middle East, gaining critical feedback while also delivering real-world results for those early adopters. Other companies have taken similar approaches: deliver cutting-edge technology to warfighters first\u2014even before any formal requirement exists\u2014refine it in the field, and let the bureaucracy catch up later.</p><p>While we are encouraged by these bold efforts, we also recognize that rapidly deploying cutting-edge technology is not enough. What matters most is enabling and rewarding companies that deliver measurable impact on mission outcomes and operational effectiveness. We urge the Department of Defense to prioritize this focus across both traditional primes and neoprimes.</p><p><strong>Delivering On Time and Within Budget</strong></p><p>Neoprimes often prioritize outcomes over processes. For instance, Palantir was recently awarded a $178 million contract by the U.S. Army to develop the TITAN system, beating RTX Corporation in a competitive selection process. Remarkably, Palantir delivered the project on time and within budget\u2014traditionally a rare feat in defense contracting.</p><p>As one example of neoprimes' outcome-first approach, we have observed a growing preference for fixed-price contracts over the traditional cost-plus model. Under a fixed-price structure, companies are incentivized to innovate efficiently, as they are paid a set amount regardless of overruns. This stands in stark contrast to cost-plus contracts, where incumbents are reimbursed for all expenses and earn a profit margin on top\u2014removing much of the pressure to operate leanly.</p><p>When analyzing government spending data, we observed that nearly 100% of Palantir and SpaceX's contracts are fixed-price, while 65-80% of Anduril's contracts follow the same model. Among the traditional primes, General Dynamics has steadily secured an increasing number of fixed-price contracts, and the trend is less clear for others.</p><p>That said, both neoprimes and traditional contractors continue to rely on cost-plus contracts, as they remain the prevailing norm across much of the defense industry. We also recognize that ongoing debate surrounds the use of firm fixed-price versus cost-plus models in defense procurement. While advocates of fixed-price contracts view them as the most effective way for the government to ensure value and accountability, critics argue that fixed-price models can be too risky for complex scopes of work. A common argument in favor of cost-plus is that it provides the necessary flexibility when project requirements are uncertain or evolving.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"><br /></div> <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-90\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"10d7c\" src=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.png?id=61219438&amp;width=980\" /> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong><strong>Maximizing Revenue and Contract Value per Employee</strong></strong></p><p>Neoprimes operate with small, agile teams\u2014often with just a fraction of the headcount of traditional defense contractors. But what they lack in size, they make up for in velocity and output. Many of these companies are producing higher revenue or contract value per employee.</p><p>SpaceX and Anduril have outperformed several major traditional defense contractors in terms of obligations per employee, exceeding the ratios of Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics. And while Lockheed Martin has outperformed all in absolute terms, that may be attributed to its significantly larger revenue\u2014approximately $51 billion compared to SpaceX's $3.8 billion. </p><p>Note that because Anduril and SpaceX are still private companies, we based their employee counts on estimates from public reports. Palantir and all traditional primes report employee numbers in their SEC filings.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e1a8d\" src=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.png?id=61219057&amp;width=980\" /> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>Rising Use of OTAs in Defense Contracting</strong></p><p>While Palantir, SpaceX, and Anduril are leading neoprimes, several other companies are rapidly emerging in this category. Shield AI, which began with AI-powered quadcopters for U.S. Navy SEALs and other special operations forces, is now fielding its V-BAT unmanned aerial vehicle in Ukraine, Japan, and Brazil. Companies like Saildrone and Saronic are deploying a range of autonomous drones above and below the water. Cybersecurity leaders such as Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, and Crowdstrike are becoming key players in areas like trusted networks and digital defense. Commercial space companies like Varda, HawkEye 360, and Astranis are building capabilities for on-demand space access, persistent satellite coverage, and high-speed space-based data transfer.</p><p>With the rise of neoprimes, the Department of Defense has significantly increased its use of Other Transaction Agreements (OTAs) in recent years, reflecting a strategic shift toward more agile and flexible procurement methods. OTAs, which are not bound by the traditional Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), allow the Department of Defense to collaborate more easily with nontraditional contractors, including startups and research institutions. When properly executed, we believe that OTAs can lead to better, faster, cheaper outcomes for everyone involved\u2014saving time, money, and effort.</p><p>Further analysis shows that OTA usage is clearly trending upward within the Department of Defense. Even though OTA awards have increased significantly since 2017, however, they still account for only about 0.116% of the total contracts awarded by the Department of Defense\u2014it's still far from mainstream in the broad acquisition community. Given what OTAs have already delivered, we can only imagine the impact if more contracts were accelerated this way.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ff678\" src=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.png?id=61219059&amp;width=980\" /> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>The Road Ahead: Partnering with Neoprimes to Meet Emerging National Security Needs</strong></p><p>Today, we believe the U.S. government is beginning to recognize the strategic value of neoprimes in addressing critical capability gaps. The Department of Defense has acknowledged its lag in several key technology areas and has taken deliberate steps to close the gap. In addition to encouraging the services to expand their use of OTAs, the Department of Defense introduced the Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) framework to attract non-traditional vendors. It also launched the Office of Strategic Capital to provide more flexible financing options and created the National Security Innovation Capital initiative to support dual-use hardware development. Over the past two decades, the Department of Defense has invested more than $20 billion in small business initiatives\u2014all promising signs of progress, but more work remains. </p><p>Across the country, dozens of emerging technology companies are winning contracts that would have defaulted to traditional primes just a few years ago. These startups are not simply disrupting the defense industrial base; they are actively shaping the future of warfare. Their technologies are beginning to influence military doctrine, operational planning, and frontline tactics. </p><p>This shift reflects a broader transformation in national security priorities\u2014one we strongly support and believe must be accelerated. As these threats become increasingly software- and technology-driven, we\u2019re encouraged to see Silicon Valley and its neoprimes emerge as natural leaders in enabling the next generation of military readiness. Now is the time to double down.</p><p><em><em><strong>Editor's Note: The authors of this article are affiliated with Brave Capital and MVA (MilVet Angels), which have invested in national security companies like Anduril Industries, Shield AI, Aetherflux, Hermeus, Ursa Major, and others.</strong></em></em></p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

Its military has suffered staggering losses \u2013 more than one million soldiers killed or wounded since its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Analysts say its economy is in its weakest state in three decades. And more than three years after Putin launched his \u201cspecial military operation\u201d against Ukraine, Russia appears no closer to achieving its initial war aims than it was when the first troops paratroopers dropped into Kyiv.  </p><p>All of this begs the question: Whatever Putin\u2019s ambitions, can Russia pose a credible threat to the rest of Europe?   </p><p>\u201cTo launch a large-scale conventional armed incursion into a NATO country is not something Russia would want to do today,\u201d Kurt Volker, a former U.S. Ambassador to NATO, told <em><em>The Cipher Brief.</em></em> \u201cThey are bogged down in Ukraine. Their forces are not trained and equipped and capable where they want them to be.\u201d   </p><p>General Philip Breedlove (Ret.), a Cipher Brief expert who served as Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, describes \u201ctwo realities\u201d about the Russian threat.   </p><p>\u201cThe first reality is that Russia's army is really badly mauled and beaten up right now,\u201d said Breedlove. \u201cIt certainly is not ten feet tall, like we used to think. I jokingly say it's about five-foot five these days. So, over the next several years, in a land warfare context, Europe could do just fine.\u201d </p><p>But Gen. Breedlove says the second \u201creality\u201d is that Russia will work hard to rebuild its military might, that it has allies who will help, and that it has less conventional ways to threaten Europe in the meantime.   </p><p>\u201cIn many ways, Mr. Putin's running amok out there,\u201d he said, \u201cin the hybrid war, the below-the-line fight, whatever you want to call that war.\u201d   </p><p><strong>One view: A battered, beaten-down Russia</strong> </p><p>By almost any military or economic metric, Russia is in no position today to threaten other nations in Europe. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-june-12-2025\" target=\"_blank\"><u>estimates that Russia</u></a> has suffered between 900,000 and 1.3 million casualties since the 2022 invasion \u2013 including 350,000 troops killed in action. (By comparison, in the decade-long war in Afghanistan, the Soviets suffered roughly 50,000 dead and wounded.) <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/graphic-detail/2025/07/09/russias-summer-ukraine-offensive-looks-like-its-deadliest-so-far\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><em>The Economist</em></em></u></a> estimates that in Russia\u2019s current offensive, launched on May 1<u>,</u><span></span>31,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, for only snail-like advances.   </p><p>As for the <a href=\"https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/russias-economy-could-be-headed-for-collapse/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Russian economy</u></a>, the strains are evident in a growing budget deficit, falling oil revenues, and soaring interest rates. Last week, the main lending rate stood at a record 21%.   </p><p>Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges (Ret.), who served from 2014 to 2017 as the top U.S. Army Commander in Europe, said that given these realities, he has been surprised by Russia\u2019s staying power in Ukraine.   </p><p>\u201cRussia, I was certain, would not have made it this long,\u201d Hodges told <em><em>The Cipher Brief</em></em>, \u201cgiven the casualties that they have suffered, and the effects of some of the sanctions on them.\u201d  </p><p>Volker believes Russia\u2019s weaknesses \u2013 economic and military \u2013 are as profound as they have been at any other time during Putin\u2019s quarter century in charge.   </p><p>\u201cThey have lost a third of their strategic bombers,\u201d Volker said. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost a million people off the battlefield. They\u2019re having to replenish with recently conscripted untrained forces. And they're digging into storage to get World War II era equipment.\u201d</p><p>Ambassador Doug Lute, who \u2013 like Volker \u2013 served as U.S. Ambassador to NATO, said that \u201cPutin's army, which invaded Ukraine in 2022, largely does not exist today.\u201d</p><p>Lute notes that while Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion force was the product of a decade-long modernization ordered by Putin, Ukraine has succeeded \u2013 with on-and-off help from the West \u2013 in severely degrading those forces. Lute is among those experts who believe Russia will need a long time and fresh resources to truly threaten the rest of Europe.  </p><p>\u201cWe should remember that the last time Putin undertook such a modernization, it resulted in the force that failed in 2022,\u201d he said.  </p><p>Others aren\u2019t so sure. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

With those numbers, they will be able to constitute the force size that they choose fairly quickly.\u201d  </p><p>\u201cI think General Cavoli put this very well,\u201d Liana Fix, a Senior Fellow for Europe, told <em><em>The Cipher Brief</em></em>. \u201cHe said Russia was in a very bad position, but it can reconstitute its military much faster than we might expect.\u201d That, Fix said, means that while Russia may not threaten NATO nations now, it won\u2019t be long before it does.  </p><p>\u201cIf [Russia] continues on this path of very quick reconstitution of its military with China's help, it will pose a serious threat to NATO allies,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that's what they are all concerned about.\u201d  </p><p><strong>The gray-zone threat </strong> </p><p>While it may take time for Russia\u2019s conventional military to rebuild, Moscow has been extremely effective launching operations in the gray zone, that area of operations that falls just under the threshold of war.

The Danish Defense Intelligence Service (DDIS) <a href=\"http://v/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>issued an analysis</u></a> of the Russian threat earlier this year, offering three scenarios \u2013 all of them starting with an end to the Ukraine war, and the assumption that Russia cannot currently wage war against multiple nations.   </p><p>Within six months of the guns going silent in Ukraine, the DDIS said, Russia would be able to wage a local war with a bordering country. In two years, it would have the capacity to launch a regional war in the Baltic Sea region. And within five years, it could launch a large-scale attack on Europe.  </p><p>\"Russia is likely to be more willing to use military force in a regional war against one or more European NATO countries if it perceives NATO as militarily weakened or politically divided,\" <a href=\"https://www.fe-ddis.dk/globalassets/fe/dokumenter/2025/trusselsvurderinger/-20250209_opdateret_vurdering_af_truslen_fra_rusland_mod--.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the report said</u></a>. \"This is particularly true if Russia assesses that the U.S. cannot or will not support the European NATO countries in a war with Russia.\"  </p><p>Germany\u2019s defense chief told the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62v63gl8rvo\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><em>BBC</em></em></u><u> last month</u></a> that Russia would be militarily ready to attack within four years \u2013 and perhaps sooner than that.  </p><p>\u201cIf you ask me now, is this a guarantee that's not earlier than 2029?\u201d General Carsten Breuer commented, \u201cI would say no, it's not. We must be able to fight tonight.\"   </p><p>In all these assessments, there are variables that would alter the calendar: the global price of oil \u2013 upon which Russia depends for revenue; the long-term loyalties of Russian allies, China in particular; and the mood of U.S. President Donald Trump, who is expressing frustration with Putin while offering more military aid to Ukraine.   </p><p>All those interviewed for this story made the point that robust and continued Western support for Ukraine \u2013 and sanctions against Russia \u2013 would prove critical in determining when Russia is truly able to menace other European nations.   </p><p>\u201cAll of this really turns on our credibility,\u201d Gen. Breedlove told us. \u201cI think Mr. Putin senses weakness and he knows what to do in the presence of weakness.\u201d   </p><p>Lt. Gen. Hodges said that the most important determinant of Russia\u2019s ability to threaten other nations in Europe will be how it ultimately fares in Ukraine.   </p><p>\u201cWhat I am sure of is that if Ukraine capitulates or fails, or if we turn our back on Ukraine and Russia is able then to take a couple of years to rebuild and fix what is broken, they will be knocking on the door of Moldova and on the door of Latvia or any other Baltic nation,\u201d Hodges said.   </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because their objective is to break the alliance, to show that NATO and its member nations are not really willing to fight against Russia over a piece of Estonia, for example, or a piece of Latvia. To make sure that the Russians never make that terrible miscalculation, we have to get back to where we were in the Cold War days, of spending what's necessary, of being prepared so that you can have another 40, 50 years of no war with Russia.\u201d  </p><p><em><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to </strong></em></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><em><strong>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</strong></em></em></u></a><em><em><strong> on YouTube?

    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/afghanistan-taliban-russia",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>In recent weeks, reports of Russia considering formal engagement and recognition of the Taliban have reignited debate around international approaches to the de facto rulers of Afghanistan.</p><p>But contrary to assumptions of ideological or strategic alignment, Moscow\u2019s overtures appear rooted more in fear than affinity.</p><p><strong>A Security-Driven Outreach</strong></p><p>Russia\u2019s posture toward the Taliban must be viewed through a regional security lens. In intelligence and counterterrorism circles, there is increasing alarm in Moscow over the surge in foreign extremist fighters now operating with impunity inside Afghanistan. Russia has long claimed that ISIS-K and affiliated groups enjoy covert support from Western intelligence services, a claim that is exaggerated but nonetheless fuels deep strategic paranoia within the Kremlin.</p><p>Recent intelligence reports indicate a notable uptick in foreign terrorist presence, particularly in northern and eastern provinces bordering Central Asia. Russia is concerned not just about Afghanistan\u2019s instability, but about its spillover potential into Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, all countries with fragile internal balances and historical ties to Moscow.</p><p>In this context, engagement with the Taliban is less about diplomatic recognition and more about gaining operational access, establishing surveillance footholds, and ensuring a minimal level of information-sharing. For Russia, the Taliban may be a tactical irritant, but foreign jihadist groups are a strategic threat.</p><p><strong>Taliban\u2019s Quest for Legitimacy</strong></p><p>From the Taliban\u2019s side, any engagement by major powers is quickly repackaged as de facto recognition\u2014a form of validation they desperately seek. Lacking internal legitimacy and having seized power through force, the Taliban views external recognition as a shortcut to international acceptance, regardless of the terms or the motives of the recognizing party.</p><p>Whether Russia\u2019s engagement is rooted in security fears or strategic containment is irrelevant to the Taliban; what matters is the optics. This dynamic creates a dangerous asymmetry, where tactical coordination by foreign states can be misrepresented as endorsement of Taliban governance.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It\u2019s never been more important to understand what\u2019s happening in the world. Upgrade your access to exclusive content by </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\"><em>becoming a subscriber</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>The China Factor: Quiet Watchfulness</strong></p><p>Speculation has mounted that China may follow suit. However, Beijing\u2019s interests in Afghanistan remain fundamentally different from Moscow\u2019s. For China, the overriding concern is the presence of Uyghur militants \u201cEast Turkistan Islamic Movement\u201d, many of whom have historically sought refuge in Afghanistan\u2019s east.</p><p>At the same time, China\u2019s strategic posture is fixated on its global rivalry with the United States, particularly in the domains of economic dominance and technological superiority\u2014most notably in artificial intelligence. Afghanistan, in this framework, is a peripheral concern. As long as Beijing can secure its western flank through covert financial leverage, trade access, and intelligence coordination, it has little incentive to formally recognize the Taliban. Such a move would carry diplomatic costs without any meaningful strategic return.</p><p><strong>A Word of Caution for the International Community</strong></p><p>While Russia and China may justify Taliban engagement based on narrow national security imperatives, these moves carry broader strategic and ethical risks. First, they undermine the international consensus that recognition must be contingent on inclusive governance, human rights, and counterterrorism compliance. Second, such recognition risks legitimizing radicalization and authoritarian consolidation through force, potentially emboldening similar movements elsewhere.</p><p>Finally, tactical engagement by states like Russia must be carefully managed to avoid the legitimization of Taliban rule, particularly in media narratives. Intelligence-sharing or backchannel coordination is a longstanding reality in conflict zones, but it must be explicitly framed as counterterrorism containment, not state-to-state diplomacy.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em><strong>Join us in Sea Island, Georgia for The Cipher Brief's </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>2025 Threat Conference</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> from October 19-22.

Afghanistan, under Taliban control, is rapidly becoming an ungoverned space\u2014one that external powers increasingly fear more than favor.</p><p>For the United States, these developments represent a critical inflection point. As global powers move from isolation to tactical engagement with the Taliban, Washington must lead in upholding the principle that recognition should never precede reform. Any diplomatic engagement\u2014whether multilateral or bilateral\u2014must be explicitly tied to measurable outcomes: meaningful counterterrorism cooperation, the protection of civil liberties, and inclusive political participation that reflects Afghanistan\u2019s ethnic and social diversity.</p><p>In the absence of such standards, the international community risks legitimizing a regime that has shown little intent to evolve\u2014and considerable capacity to destabilize.</p><p>At the same time, the United States should take a parallel step to support the formation of a legitimate political opposition to the Taliban\u2014one that represents the hopes of Afghans for a sovereign, democratic, and inclusive future. Working in coordination with international partners, Washington can help this coalition articulate a long-term political vision for the country. Though limited in scope, such a move would send a powerful message to Afghans inside and outside the country, to regional allies and adversaries alike, and even to the Taliban: that Afghanistan\u2019s future will not be defined by force alone. Most importantly, it would empower Afghans themselves particularly the new generation to lead the struggle for their nation's destiny.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

But each new life stage brings gains as well as losses</p><p>Sitting in a cafe recently, I saw a poster advertising a barista training course for young people interested in a career in hot beverages. Things in the NHS being what they are, I enjoyed losing myself in a fantasy future spent standing behind a sleek, shiny machine, having witty exchanges with customers and colleagues as I skilfully poured smooth, foaming milk into silky dark espresso, tipping and turning each cup to create my own unique artworks on the coffee surface.</p><p>That was until I read the small print, which included the rather brutal definition of \u201cyoung people\u201d as aged 18 to 24.

In addition to his lobbyists successfully advocating for several new laws, Abbott cited the <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/tags/tesla\">Tesla</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/tags/spacex\">SpaceX</a> CEO as the inspiration for the state creating its own efficiency office and has praised him for moving the headquarters for many of his businesses to the state in recent years. </p>\n\n<p>As part of an effort to <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-07-02/texas-elon-musk-spacex\">track the billionaire\u2019s influence</a> in the state Capitol, The Texas Newsroom in April requested Abbott and his staff\u2019s emails since last fall with Musk and other people who have an email address associated with some of his companies. </p>\n\n<p>Initially, the governor\u2019s office said it would take more than 13 hours to review the records. It provided a cost estimate of $244.64 for the work and required full payment up front. The Texas Newsroom agreed and cut a check. </p>\n\n<p>After the check was cashed, the governor\u2019s office told The Texas Newsroom it believed all of the records were confidential and asked Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose office referees disputes over public records, to allow the documents to be kept private.</p>\n\n<p>Matthew Taylor, Abbott\u2019s public information coordinator, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25975648-2025-06-03-abbott-musk-comms-appeal/\">gave several reasons</a> the records should not be released. He argued they include private exchanges with lawyers, details about policy-making decisions and information that would reveal how the state entices companies to invest here. Releasing them to the public, he wrote, \u201cwould have a chilling effect on the frank and open discussion necessary for the decision-making process.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Taylor also argued that the communications are confidential under an exception to public records laws known as \u201ccommon-law privacy\u201d because they consist of \u201cinformation that is intimate and embarrassing and not of legitimate concern to the public, including financial decisions that do not relate to transactions between an individual and a governmental body.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>He did not provide further details about the exact content of the records.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The language Abbott\u2019s office used appears to be fairly boilerplate. Paxton\u2019s office, in an explanation of the <a href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/open-government/governmental-bodies/open-records-memorandum-rulings\">common-law privacy exception</a> on its website, mentions that \u201cpersonal financial information\u201d that doesn\u2019t deal with government transactions \u201cis generally highly intimate or embarrassing and must be withheld.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But Bill Aleshire, a Texas-based attorney specializing in public records law, was appalled that the governor is claiming that months of emails between his office and one of the world\u2019s richest people are all private.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRight now, it appears they\u2019ve charged you $244 for records they have no intention of giving you,\u201d Aleshire said. \u201cThat is shocking.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Aleshire said it\u2019s not unusual for government agencies to tap the common-law privacy exception in an attempt to withhold records from the public. But he\u2019s used to it being cited in cases that involve children, medical data or other highly personal information \u2014 not for emails between an elected official and a businessman. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re boxing in the dark,\u201d Aleshire said. \u201cYou can\u2019t even see what the target is or what\u2019s behind their claim.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Aleshire added that due to a recent <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/06/27/texas-supreme-court-paxton-abbott-uvalde-jan-6-emails/\">Texas Supreme Court ruling</a>, there is effectively no way to enforce public records laws against Abbott and other top state officials. He called the decision an \u201cace card\u201d for these politicians. </p>\n\n<p>The case dealt with requests to release Abbott and Paxton\u2019s communications in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and the 2022 <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/uvalde-officer-student-trainings-mass-shootings\">school shooting in Uvalde</a>. The high court ruled that it is the only body that can review whether these officials are in compliance with public records laws.</p>\n\n<p>Kevin Bagnall, a lawyer representing Musk\u2019s rocket company <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25984819-spacex-objections-to-oog-pir-202-25-redacted/\">SpaceX, also wrote a letter</a> to Paxton\u2019s office arguing the emails should be kept secret. He cited one main reason: They contain \u201ccommercial information whose disclosure would cause SpaceX substantial competitive harm.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>Most of the rest of Bagnall\u2019s letter, which further explained SpaceX\u2019s argument, was redacted.</p>\n\n<p>Musk and representatives for his companies did not respond to requests for comment for this story.</p>\n\n<p>Abbott\u2019s spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the records, including whether The Texas Newsroom would be refunded if Paxton withholds them. </p>\n\n<p>In a statement, he said, \u201cThe Office of the Governor rigorously complies with the Texas Public Information Act and will release any responsive information that is determined to not be confidential or excepted from disclosure.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The office of the attorney general has 45 business days to determine whether to release Abbott\u2019s records.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Lauren McGaughy is a journalist with <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/texasnewsroom\">The Texas Newsroom</a>, a collaboration among NPR and the public radio stations in Texas.

You\u2019ll be grateful you made the right choices </p><p>Ah, sleep \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=henry4p2&amp;Act=3&amp;Scene=1&amp;Scope=scene\">nature\u2019s soft nurse</a>\u201d to Shakespeare, \u201cthe foundation of our mental and physical health\u201d to the less poetically minded neuroscientist and podcaster Andrew Huberman. By now, you hopefully know that getting a consistent seven to eight hours of shuteye is crucial for everything from your short-term decision-making to your long-term health, and you\u2019re familiar with all the usual advice on getting it (have a consistent bedtime, make your bedroom really dark, no double espressos at 9pm). But one question that\u2019s considered less is: what if you have <em>one</em> restless night? How do you best get through the day \u2013 and what can you do to avoid a single interrupted slumber snowballing into several? Let\u2019s take it one hour at a time.</p><p>When you first drag yourself out of bed, it\u2019s tempting to click the kettle straight on \u2013 but should you hold off your first hot drink of the day until you\u2019re a bit less bleary-eyed? Increasingly, influencers advise delaying your first hit of tea or coffee for anywhere between 30 and 90 minutes after you wake up \u2013 the rationale being that caffeine mostly works by blocking the brain\u2019s receptors for a molecule called adenosine, which ordinarily promotes relaxation by slowing down neural activity. Adenosine levels are at their lowest when you wake up, and so in theory, you might be \u201cwasting\u201d your first brew of the day by glugging it when there\u2019s nothing for the caffeine to block. This seems plausible, but it\u2019s also worth noting that caffeine\u2019s effects take about 10 minutes to kick in, and it\u2019s about 45 minutes before levels peak in the bloodstream. Caffeine\u2019s also not <em>just</em> good for getting you going: if you\u2019re planning a workout or a morning walk, it can help things along by <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31793465/\">producing feelgood endorphins</a> and increasing the amount of fat <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/ExerciseAndAthleticPerformance-HealthProfessional/#caffeine\">you\u2019re able to burn.</a> Some people suggest that waiting a while before your first cup helps to avoid afternoon drowsiness, but according to <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10930107/\">an evaluation of the scientific literature</a> published last year, \u201cThere is no evidence that caffeine ingestion upon waking is somehow responsible for an afternoon \u2018crash\u2019.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/14/terrible-nights-sleep-heres-how-to-make-it-through-the-day-and-maybe-even-enjoy-it-one-step-at-a-time\">Continue reading...</a>",

More than 100 people died, most by drowning in floodwaters or being crushed by water-fueled landslides.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe had no idea it was going to do what it did,\u201d said Jeff Howell, the now-retired emergency manager in Yancey County, North Carolina, a rural expanse that suffered the most deaths per capita. </p>\n\n<p>A week ago, the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry slipped up from the coast of Mexico, drawing moisture from the Gulf, then collided with another system and inundated rivers and creeks in hilly south central Texas. More than 100 people are confirmed dead, many of them children, with more missing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe had no reason to believe that this was going to be anything like what\u2019s happened here \u2014 none whatsoever,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdnTaQAJkQo\">County Judge Rob Kelly</a>, the top elected official in Kerr County, Texas, where most of the deaths occurred.</p>\n\n<p>The similarities between North Carolina and Texas extend beyond the words of these two officials. In both disasters, there was a disconnect between accurate weather alerts and on-the-ground action that could have saved lives. </p>\n\n<p>Officials in each of those places were warned. The National Weather Service sent urgent alerts about potentially life-threatening danger <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/texas-july-4-flood-timeline-ddf1090207b67c6ab716aedc8b239fc2\">hours in advance of the flash floods</a>, leaving time to notify and try to evacuate people in harm\u2019s way. </p>\n\n<p>In Texas, some local officials did just that. But others did not.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/hurricane-helene-evacuation-warnings-yancey-county-north-carolina\">a ProPublica investigation found</a> that when Helene hit on Sept. 27, some local officials in North Carolina issued evacuation orders. At least five counties in Helene\u2019s path, including Yancey, did not. Howell said the enormity of the storm was far worse than anyone alive had ever seen and that he notified residents as best he could.</p>\n\n<p>The National Weather Service described Helene\u2019s approach for days. It sent out increasingly dire alerts warning of dangerous flash flooding and landslides. Its staff spoke directly with local emergency managers and held webinar updates. A Facebook message <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NWSGSP/posts/pfbid0GkYCwtugC5ji2wS78dc91wV7o2BvA27TB3s8KcRbeiZpFvBni7ybB3WZ5VAtMWUql?rdid=0JXL2DwWfIovOSMI\">the regional office posted</a> around 1 p.m. the day before Helene hit warned of \u201csignificant to catastrophic, life-threatening flooding\u201d in the mountains. \u201cThis will be one of the most significant weather events to happen in the western portions of the area in the modern era.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, in Texas, the weather service warned of potential for flash flooding the day before. Also that day, the state emergency management agency\u2019s regional director had \u201cpersonally contacted\u201d county judges, mayors and others \u201cin that area and notified them all of potential flooding,\u201d Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick later said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGkqVruBc9Y\">at a press conference</a>. </p>\n\n<p>AccuWeather, a commercial weather forecasting service, issued the first flash flood warning in Kerr County at 12:44 a.m. on July 4, roughly three hours before the catastrophic flooding. A half-hour later, <a href=\"https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/wx/afos/p.php?pil=FFWEWX&amp;e=202507040614\">at 1:14 a.m.</a>, the National Weather Service sent a similar warning to two specific areas, including central Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River\u2019s banks and hills are dotted with vacation homes, summer camps and campgrounds \u2014 many filled with July 4 vacationers slumbering in cabins and RVs.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFlash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly,\u201d the weather service alert said. Impacts could include \u201clife threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A severity descriptor on that alert sent it to weather radios and the nation\u2019s Wireless Emergency Alerts system, which blasts weather warnings to cellphones to blare an alarm.</p>\n\n<p>AccuWeather\u2019s chief meteorologist, Jonathan Porter, was dismayed to hear news later that all the children attending youth camps in Kerr County had not been ushered to higher ground despite those warnings.</p>\n\n<p>At Camp Mystic, a beloved century-old Christian summer camp for girls, at least 27 campers and counselors were killed. Six still haven\u2019t been found. Its director also died, while trying to rescue children. (People at the camp said they received little to no help from the authorities, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/us/texas-flood-local-response.html\">The New York Times</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was very concerned to see that campers were awoken not by someone coming to tell them to evacuate based on timely warnings issued but rather by rapidly rising water that was going up to the second level of their bunkbeds,\u201d Porter said. </p>\n\n<p>In the area, known as Flash Flood Alley, Porter called this \u201ca tragedy of the worst sort\u201d because it appeared camps and local officials could have mobilized sooner in response to the alerts.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere was plenty of time to evacuate people to higher ground,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThe question is, Why did that not happen?\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>But Dalton Rice, city manager of Kerrville, the county seat, said at a press conference the next day that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/05/texas-flooding-updates-guadalupe-river-camp-mystic/84477734007/\">there wasn\u2019t a lot of time</a>\u201d to communicate the risk to camps because the floodwaters rose so rapidly.</p>\n\n<p>Rice said that at 3:30 a.m. \u2014 more than two hours after the flash flood warnings began \u2014 he went jogging near the Guadalupe River to check it out but didn\u2019t see anything concerning. </p>\n\n<p>But 13 miles upriver from the park where he was jogging, the river began \u2014 <a href=\"https://water.noaa.gov/gauges/08165500\">at 3:10 a.m</a>. \u2014 to rise 25 feet in just two hours.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/vtec/?year=2025&amp;wfo=KEWX&amp;phenomena=FF&amp;significance=W&amp;eventid=38&amp;tab=textdata&amp;radar=USCOMP&amp;radar_product=N0Q&amp;radar_time=202507040815\">At 4:03 a.m.</a>, the weather service upgraded the warning to an \u201cemergency\u201d\u2014 its most severe flash flood alert \u2014 with a tag of \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d It singled out the Guadalupe River at Hunt in Kerr County: \u201cThis is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The local sheriff said he wasn\u2019t made aware of the flooding until 4 to 5 a.m. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/texas-officials-give-answers-growing-questions-response-kerr-county-de-rcna217515\">He has declined to say</a> whether the local emergency manager, who is responsible for alerting the public to approaching storms, was awake when the flash flood warnings went out starting at 1 a.m. <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/07/08/texas-weather-service-warning-kerr-county/\">The Texas Tribune reported</a> that Kerrville\u2019s mayor said he wasn\u2019t aware of the flooding until around 5:30 a.m., when the city manager called and woke him up. </p>\n\n<p>Local officials <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/10/us/kerr-country-officials-response-texas-flooding\">have refused to provide more details</a>, saying they are focused on finding the more than 100 people still missing and notifying loved ones of deaths.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            First image: Hurricane Helene\u2019s aftermath in Asheville, North Carolina, last September. Second image: A search-and-rescue worker looks through debris on July 6 after flash flooding in Hunt, Texas.\n    \n            (First image: Sean Rayford/Getty Images. Second image: Jim Vondruska/Getty Images)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>One challenge as disasters approach is that weather alerts often don\u2019t reach the people in harm\u2019s way.</p>\n\n<p>In rural areas across Texas and North Carolina alike, cellphone service can be spotty on the best of days, and some people turn off alert notifications. In North Carolina\u2019s remote mountains, many people live at least somewhat off the grid. The cell service isn\u2019t great everywhere, and many aren\u2019t glued to phones or social media. In Texas, Kerr County residents posted on Facebook complaints that they didn\u2019t receive the weather service\u2019s alerts while others said their phones blared all night with warnings. </p>\n\n<p>Many counties also use apps to send their own alerts, often tailored to their specific rivers and roads. But residents must opt in to receive them. Kerr County uses CodeRed, but it isn\u2019t clear what alerts it sent out overnight. </p>\n\n<p>Pete Jensen has spent a long career in emergency management, including responding to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack. He served as an official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency during Hurricane Katrina and often ponders why more people don\u2019t receive \u2014 and heed \u2014 weather alerts.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of denial,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cDisasters happen to someone else. They don\u2019t happen to me.\u201d That can include local officials who \u201cdon\u2019t always understand what their responsibilities are. They very often react like most humans do \u2014 in denial.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>There is one big difference between the disasters in Texas and North Carolina. In Texas, residents, journalists and others have demanded accountability from local officials. Gov. Greg Abbott has called the Legislature into special session starting July 21 to discuss flood warning systems, flood emergency communications and natural disaster preparation. </p>\n\n<p>But that hasn\u2019t happened in North Carolina. The state legislature has yet to discuss possible changes, such as expanding its Know Your Zone evacuation plan beyond the coast, or <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/fema-grants-trump-emergencies\">boost funding</a> for local emergency managers. (Instead, lawmakers went home in late June without passing <a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article309506565.html\">a full budget</a>.) Many emergency managers, including in Yancey County, operate in rural areas with small tax bases and skeleton staffs. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere still has not been an outcry here for, How do we do things differently?\u201d said state Sen. Julie Mayfield, a Democrat from Asheville. \u201cIt still feels like we\u2019re very much in recovery mode.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>North Carolina\u2019s emergency management agency <a href=\"https://www.ncdps.gov/division/emergency-management/ts-helene-after-action-review/open\">commissioned a review</a> of its handling of the disaster. The report found the state agency severely understaffed, but it didn\u2019t examine issues such as evacuations or local emergency managers\u2019 actions before Helene hit.</p>\n\n<p>Erika Andresen also lives in Asheville, a mountain city in the heart of Helene\u2019s destruction, where she helps businesses prepare for disasters. A lawyer and former Army judge advocate, she also teaches emergency management. After Helene, she was among the few voices in North Carolina <a href=\"https://www.eaasc.com/post/they-didn-t-tell-me-why-you-need-an-expert-to-survive-helene\">criticizing the lack of evacuations</a> and other inactions ahead of the storm. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI knew right away, both from my instinct and from my experience, that a lot of things went terribly wrong,\u201d Andresen said. When she got pushback against criticizing local authorities in a time of crisis, she countered, \u201cWe need accountability.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><strong>Clarification, July 11, 2025:</strong> This story has been clarified to specify where AccuWeather issued the first flash flood warning.</p>",

    "description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\u201cTo each there comes in their lifetime a special moment when they are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing\u2026\u201d</em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> \u2014 Winston S. Churchill</p><p><strong>OPINION</strong> -- Winston Churchill would have recognized the current situation in the U.S. relationship with Russia as a unique opportunity to make a mark on history. </p><p>Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin reaffirmed Moscow\u2019s war intentions in Ukraine, saying he considered Russians and Ukrainians to be one people and, \u201cin that sense the whole of Ukraine is ours.\u201d In the past two weeks, Putin has intensified Russia\u2019s drone and missile attacks across Ukraine putting heavy strain on Ukrainian air defenses. The Russian president is evidently of the view that Ukraine\u2019s defenses may be on the verge of collapse and that he can achieve his war ambitions through force.</p><p>Putin has cleverly played his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, whispering intentions of ending the war through negotiation and counting on Trump\u2019s desire for peace to push Ukraine into a deal that would essentially amount to surrender. But Putin has never once deviated from his maximalist goals in the war, in fact, he has only reaffirmed them at every opportunity. Russian participation in negotiations with Ukraine were quickly proven to be a form of \u2018maskirovka\u2019 (successful operations that mislead the enemy).</p><p>Now, Putin has intensified a bombing campaign clearly designed to target civilian infrastructure with the intent of both killing and demoralizing the Ukrainian people, and undermining support for the war and for the government in Kyiv.</p><p>Trump and his team seem to have finally arrived at the realization that they have been taken for a ride by Putin. The U.S. president recently characterized discussions with the Russian leader as \u201cmeaningless,\u201d saying, \u201cWe get a lot of bullsh*t thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth.\u201d (President Trump is not known for understatement. This may be the exception.)</p><p>Following his most recent call with Putin and a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump decided to resume sending some air defense interceptors and precision-guided bombs and missiles to Ukraine after last month\u2019s halt. This is a positive development but it is not enough. </p><p>Now is the critical moment to show strength, unity, and resolve to support the people of Ukraine. The U.S. President should not let himself be distracted by any suggestion relayed by Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov to Secretary of State Rubio after the two exchanged views on new ideas for Ukraine peace talks. (Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.)</p><p>The people of Ukraine understand better than anyone, the existential nature of Putin\u2019s aggression. They see what Russia is doing by kidnapping Ukrainian children and sending them to the territory of the Russian Federation. They see the elimination of Ukrainian language instruction in schools in areas Russia occupies. They see the dreadful, starved and tortured condition of Ukrainian soldiers who are returned in prisoner exchanges. For Ukraine, surrender or conquest means extermination. To end this, more military, economic and political assistance is required.</p><p>The decision by the U.S. to participate in the recent \u201cCoalition of the Willing\u201d meeting is another step in the right direction. U.S. participation sends an important message to our allies and to Putin. Trump should immediately take other actions to send Putin and the world a clear message of support for the victim in this conflict, Ukraine. </p><p>A good first step would be to support legislation sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal that targets Russia and countries that purchase Russian hydrocarbon products with stiff sanctions. The full range of available weapons systems should also be fast-tracked for delivery to Ukraine. Restrictions on their use in targeting military installations in the territory of the Russian Federation should be immediately removed. And high priority in that target set should be the factories that produce the Shahed drones that are now being used as weapons of terror against Ukrainian civilians.</p><p>President Trump should take a big picture view of the world Putin has created and the actual state of play of the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d that Putin has built. </p><p>In December of 2024, one of the key players in the Axis, former Syrian President Basher al Assad, saw his government collapse and he fled to exile in Moscow. Since October 2023, Israel has ruthlessly dismantled favored surrogates of the Axis, including Hamas and Hezbollah. The U.S. used military force to attack another favorite surrogate of Iran, the Houthis in Yemen. And in June, Israel conducted a number of stunningly effective attacks against Iran\u2019s nuclear program, military leadership, scientists, air defenses and other important targets. </p><p>Significantly, the U.S. joined Israel in conducting attacks against nuclear targets in Iran thereby demonstrating a commitment to use powerful elements of the U.S. military against a critical member of Putin\u2019s alliance. Note that all of these actions against Putin\u2019s axis received barely a peep from the great dictator in the Kremlin, much less a military response. Putin\u2019s axis is in serious trouble.</p><p>Russia\u2019s military is fully engaged in the fight against Ukraine, leaving Moscow with very little response. Estimates suggest that Russia has suffered a million casualties (killed, wounded, captured, missing) in the conflict thus far. All for the gain of a few hundred kilometers of Ukrainian territory. </p><p>The cost to Russia\u2019s economy has been similarly catastrophic. Inside his government, the mysterious deaths and suicides of regime officials and oligarchs\u2014even some considered to be Putin supporters - has got to be sending a message to those remaining - that no one is safe. The key piece in the puzzle that could bring Putin the fate he deserves is resolve from the U.S. President. </p><p>Ukraine was given just enough support not to lose against Russia under President Joe Biden, but never enough support to actually win and end this war. President Trump, you have the opportunity to show the world that you are the winning president.</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

His administration had taken extensive steps to improve relations with the Jewish community, had enacted strict rules on protests and had communicated all of that to the OCR during a previous antisemitism investigation that remained open. </p>\n\n<p>By the next day, though, there were signs that the new investigation was part of a coordinated campaign to oust him. </p>\n\n<p>One piece of evidence: the speed with which conservative news outlets reported on the OCR\u2019s action, which hadn\u2019t been publicly announced. The OCR letter was embedded in a July 2 article published by a right-wing news outlet, <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/campus/trump-administration-launches-civil-rights-probe-into-anti-semitism-at-george-mason-university/\">The Washington Free Beacon</a>. The next day, the City Journal<em>,</em> published by the influential and conservative Manhattan Institute, ran an <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/george-mason-university-president-gregory-washington-dei-anti-semitism\">opinion essay</a> headlined \u201cGeorge Mason University\u2019s Disastrous President.\u201d The article accused Washington, the university\u2019s first Black president and a first-generation college graduate, of backing \u201cracially discriminatory DEI programs\u201d \u2014 referring to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts \u2014 and failing to address campus antisemitism. It concluded that \u201cWashington\u2019s track record warrants his resignation or dismissal.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The similarities to recent events at another public university in Virginia were hard to ignore. The OCR\u2019s George Mason investigation was opened just four days after the University of Virginia\u2019s president, James E. Ryan, <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/university-of-virginia-president-reportedly-resigns-under-pressure-from-trump-administration\">announced that he was resigning</a> to help settle a federal probe into the university\u2019s DEI commitments.</p>\n\n<p>That happened after a group of conservative University of Virginia alumni, the <a href=\"https://jeffersoncouncil.org/\">Jefferson Council</a>, published blog entries and newspaper ads decrying the president \u2014 in part for focusing too heavily on diversity efforts \u2014 and demanding that he resign. The council\u2019s connections to board members and Justice Department lawyers led many observers in higher education to conclude that Ryan\u2019s forced resignation was the result of a coordinated assault.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Washington is feeling the same heat coming from similar sources.</p>\n\n<p>The temperature cranked up several degrees Thursday morning, when the Education Department notified George Mason that it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-opens-title-vi-investigation-george-mason-university\">opening a second investigation</a> \u2014 this one alleging the university illegally considers race in hiring and promoting employees. The department said it was acting on complaints from \u201cmultiple professors\u201d at GMU.</p>\n\n<p>In a press statement Thursday, Craig Trainor, the Education Department\u2019s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, suggested that the agency has already reached sweeping conclusions about the university\u2019s hiring practices. \u201cDespite the leadership of George Mason University claiming that it does not discriminate on the basis of race, it appears that its hiring and promotion policies and practices from 2020 to the present, implemented under the guise of so-called \u2018Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion,\u2019 not only allow but champion illegal racial preferencing in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This kind of pernicious and wide-spread discrimination \u2014 packaged as \u2018anti-racism\u2019 \u2014 was allowed to flourish under the Biden Administration, but it will not be tolerated by this one,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n\n<p>The university <a href=\"https://www.gmu.edu/news/2025-07/statement-regarding-new-title-vi-investigation\">rebutted those accusations in a statement</a> saying it is complying with all federal and state mandates and does not discriminate. The university \u201creceived a new Department of Education letter of investigation this morning as it was simultaneously released to news outlets, which is unprecedented in our experience,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAs always, we will work in good faith to give a full and prompt response.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, dozens of Jewish faculty members at GMU have signed on to a statement condemning \u201can attack on our university community and our GMU President that is quickly intensifying under a false, racially divisive, and deeply cynical claim of combating antisemitism.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Even before Thursday\u2019s announcement, Washington said he had detected a pattern that\u2019s been playing out at other universities targeted by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration: Multiple investigations are filed in quick succession and word leaks to news organizations.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt seems like this is orchestrated,\u201d Washington said during an interview Wednesday. \u201cThe same people who are kind of aligned that got rid of Jim Ryan are aligned against me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He finds the timing of the attacks against him and his university troubling.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGiven that the Office for Civil Rights doesn\u2019t publicly announce who is under investigation, we were wondering how these conservative outlets even got the information in the first place,\u201d Washington said. The \u201calmost hateful discussions of me\u201d in the City Journal article looked like \u201ca concerted effort to try to paint the institution in a negative light.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Washington said the piece seemed to be urging the Trump administration to take the investigation to the next level, the Department of Justice, which could levy punishments against the university.</p>\n\n<p>Many faculty members at George Mason agree. They worry that despite the OCR\u2019s insistence in its letter to the university that its investigation will be unbiased, the Trump administration has already reached a verdict on the institution\u2019s president and wants him out. As evidence, they point to a <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/could-george-mason-u-be-republicans-test-case-for-project-2025\">web of ties</a> between right-wing news organizations and politicians \u2014 including Virginia\u2019s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin \u2014 as well as some George Mason board members. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe same unfounded and coordinated attacks that pushed Ryan out of UVa are now being leveled at GMU President Greg Washington,\u201d the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors <a href=\"https://aaupmason.org/\">wrote in an online post</a>. \u201cWe think the DOJ, Governor Youngkin, and Youngkin\u2019s appointees\u201d to GMU\u2019s governing board \u201care trying to force President Washington out so they can hire an ideological ally who will impose the Governor\u2019s political ideologies on Mason\u2019s governance and curriculum.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Late Wednesday, Virginia\u2019s two Democratic U.S. senators, Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine, doubled down on those warnings, publishing an <a href=\"https://article.wn.com/view/2025/07/10/Kaine_Warner_Virginia_must_resist_Trumps_attacks_on_higher_e/\">opinion piece</a> in the Richmond Times-Dispatch saying that the Trump administration \u201cappears to be eyeing its next target\u201d with George Mason\u2019s president.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe accusations \u2014 which are pushed by bloggers with ties to ultra-conservative groups with histories of false claims about Mason and advocacy for the removal of university presidents \u2014 are eerily similar to those lodged against Ryan,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThey include vague and politically charged accusations centered around \u2018DEI\u2019 and suggestions that the university\u2019s administration has been insufficiently responsive to concerns raised by Jewish students about their safety on campus. That\u2019s despite the fact that the university\u2019s leaders have repeatedly and publicly condemned antisemitism and actually been praised by the local <a href=\"https://jcouncil.org/statements/joint-jcrc-statement-mason-hillel-recent-events-involving-george-mason-university\">Jewish Relations Council and campus Hillel</a> for their leadership and commitment to Jewish members of Mason\u2019s community.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The education department\u2019s July 1 letter <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/correct-letter-gmu.pdf\">notified</a> George Mason that it was investigating a complaint, filed in June, that Jewish students and faculty members faced a hostile environment at the Virginia university between October 2023 and the end of the 2024-2025 academic year. It gave the university until July 21 to turn over voluminous information about its response to antisemitism complaints. </p>\n\n<p>It also assured the university it would take a neutral stance in evaluating the information.</p>\n\n<p>Warner and Kaine are skeptical that the investigation will be fair and impartial: In their opinion piece, they said it\u2019s more likely \u201cto serve as yet another smokescreen to punish universities and leaders who don\u2019t align with their ideological goals.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Some George Mason faculty members share these concerns. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen you start seeing these hit pieces come out one after another in a matter of days, you know it\u2019s coordinated,\u201d Bethany L. Letiecq, a professor in the College of Education and Human Development, said in an interview. </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, higher education leaders have <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/its-punishment-for-the-sake-of-punishment\">accused</a> the Department of Justice\u2019s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, which officially oversees investigations by several federal agencies, of ignoring procedures intended to provide due process, <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/newsletter/academe-today/2025-04-29\">racing</a> toward predetermined results, and then punishing universities by stripping them of billions of research dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Washington\u2019s critics have ties to right-wing advocates of eliminating diversity efforts and other examples of what they see as higher education\u2019s \u201cwoke\u201d policies. The author of the essay calling Washington a \u201cdisastrous\u201d president, Ian Kingsbury, has <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/education/report/the-woke-capture-charter-schools\">co-published articles</a> promoting <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/gender-affirming-care-type-2-diabetes-crisis\">conservative causes</a> with Jay P. Greene, a senior research fellow with The Heritage Foundation. Christopher F. Rufo, one of the nation\u2019s most aggressive and influential opponents of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, is among the contributing editors at City Journal<em>.</em></p>\n\n<p>Such critics are well represented in George Mason\u2019s leadership as well. </p>\n\n<p>Youngkin, the governor, appointed most of GMU\u2019s governing board, known as the board of visitors. The university\u2019s general counsel, <a href=\"https://www.highereddive.com/news/virginia-ag-elevates-wife-of-gop-donor-to-george-masons-interim-top-legal/617977/\">Anne Gentry</a>, is married to a longtime conservative activist and executive with the Koch Foundation, Letiecq pointed out. \u201cAt Mason, the foxes are in the henhouse,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an inside job.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Letiecq worries that Youngkin might exert the same kind of influence that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a fellow Republican, has in trying to reshape higher education to fit a conservative playbook. Neither Youngkin nor the board of visitors immediately responded to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI have suspected that Youngkin, in his quest for political capital, has been following the DeSantis playbook and sees Mason as a potential New College that they can take over and take down,\u201d she said. New College of Florida, once a progressive institution, <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-college-that-conservatives-took-over\">underwent substantial changes to its curriculum and staff</a> beginning in 2023 when DeSantis stacked its board with conservative members. </p>\n\n<p>Neither Kingsbury, the author of the City Journal piece, nor the Department of Education responded to inquiries about the patterns Washington saw. Eliana Johnson, editor of the Washington Free Beacon, said in a statement that \u201cour reporting speaks for itself.\u201d City Journal did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Washington defended his record in a public <a href=\"https://president.gmu.edu/news/2025-07/george-mason-affirms-its-measures-ensure-safe-and-welcoming-campus-response-new\">statement</a> on July 3. \u201cAs we prepare a response to the complaint, it is important that we all have an accurate understanding of how safe and welcoming the George Mason community is, particularly as we prepare to welcome tens of thousands of students to campus in just a few short weeks,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGeorge Mason has not been marred by the sort of violence that has rocked so many other campuses elsewhere in Virginia and around the nation following the Hamas attacks of 2023. It is a distinction we are proud of, and work hard each day to maintain.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In 11 messages that were sent to the campus community detailing the university\u2019s responses to the Hamas attacks and that were shared with The Chronicle of Higher Education<em>,</em> his office denounced \u201ccraven acts of terrorism as we have seen in Israel,\u201d urged \u201ccivil discourse, understanding, and peaceable assembly\u201d on campus and denounced the \u201cdisgusting behavior\u201d of those who were attempting to distribute antisemitic leaflets. University leaders coordinated with law enforcement to respond to two violent antisemitic actions. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s been more than a year since the last campus demonstration related to Gaza, Washington said. That protest remained safe and legal and did not disrupt university business. \u201cNo encampments have ever formed at George Mason, and we will not permit them in the future,\u201d Washington said. The university was one of the first to introduce a comprehensive safety and well-being plan, which remains in effect.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur data continues to show that our environment has dramatically improved since the horrific Hamas attacks of 2023, so we are perplexed to be receiving this investigation at this time. Nevertheless, we will respond in a forthright, direct, and timely manner to this and any inquiry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In the 2023-2024 academic year, the university received 31 bias-incident reports based on antisemitism, according to Rose Pascarell, vice president for university life. Last year, that number dropped to 12.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, she said, the university \u201cresponded fully\u201d to a previous OCR complaint related to antisemitism \u2014 but never heard back from the government.</p>\n\n<p>Letiecq said that, in her view, Washington has overreacted, not underreacted, to complaints of antisemitism, instituting restrictions on protests and punishments for protesters that she considers \u201coppressive.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is an insatiable campaign on the right and it seems there\u2019s nothing you can do to satisfy them,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>George Mason, with more than 40,000 students, is the most <a href=\"https://news.gmu.edu/news/2021-07/secrets-out-mason-virginias-most-diverse-public-university\">racially diverse public research university</a> in the state, university officials say. To comply with Trump\u2019s executive orders, the university has repurposed its DEI office to focus on compliance and community. It has cut six positions, eliminated diversity training and expanded a program in constructive dialogue. All of those changes are outlined in a lengthy report to the board. Washington insists, though, that the university won\u2019t abandon its commitments to the underlying principles its diversity efforts support.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen you are a diverse institution, you have to operate from that diverse framework,\u201d Washington said. \u201cI don\u2019t run away from that. I run toward it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>DEI expenditures represent 0.1% of the university\u2019s budget, GMU officials say.</p>\n\n<p>Asked why he agreed to speak out publicly when so many presidents have stayed silent to avoid angering the administration, Washington said the attacks were too personal to avoid.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMy philosophy is: Sunlight is disinfectant. We\u2019re going to be transparent with the community throughout the process,\u201d including the back-and-forth with OCR, he said. </p>\n\n<p>Washington says if the university is asked to make significant changes without a standard investigation and discussion of the facts, it will deal with that as necessary. \u201cWe will work in good faith to move through this,\u201d Washington said. \u201cWe will know if we\u2019re given due process by how they manage our particular case.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Katherine Mangan is a senior writer at The Chronicle of Higher Education.</p>",

The announcement comes nine months after the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/criminal-case-dismissals-anchorage-alaska\">Anchorage Daily News and ProPublica reported</a> the mass dismissals.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPublic safety begins with accountability \u2014 and we cannot hold people accountable if we don\u2019t have prosecutors in court,\u201d LaFrance said in a news release, announcing that Alaska\u2019s largest city has filled all \u201cfrontline\u201d prosecutor jobs for the first time since 2020. \u201cThis was about more than filling positions. It was about rebuilding the systems that keep Anchorage safe.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>An investigation by the newsrooms, published in October, found that city prosecutors dropped hundreds of misdemeanor cases because there weren\u2019t enough attorneys on the payroll. Between May 1 and Oct. 2 of last year, the city dropped more than 250 domestic violence assault cases and more than 270 drunken driving cases due to an inability to meet the 120-day deadline Alaska sets for upholding a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial. </p>\n\n<p>Days after the investigation came out, the state of Alaska announced it would help prosecute city cases to avoid speedy-trial dismissals. </p>\n\n<p>But those state prosecutors are no longer needed. According to the city, the municipal prosecutor\u2019s office now has a full staff of 12 \u201cfrontline\u201d prosecutors who take cases to trial, plus a supervisor and an attorney who files motions and appeals. The only vacancy, they said, is a supervisory role: deputy municipal prosecutor. </p>\n\n<p>That amounts to a vacancy rate of about 7% in the prosecutor\u2019s office. In contrast, more than 40% of city prosecutor positions were vacant as of mid-2024, according to a city spokesperson.</p>\n\n<p>At a Wednesday \u201ctrial call\u201d hearing at downtown Anchorage\u2019s Boney Courthouse, Assistant Municipal Prosecutor Andy Garbe announced the city was ready to go to trial in case after case, including a drunken driving arrest, weapons charges and domestic violence assaults. It was a far different scene from September, when prosecutors were routinely forced to drop charges in cases nearing the speedy-trial deadline.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not in the position we were last fall,\u201d Garbe said, referring to the forced dismissals. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening anymore.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>City prosecutors said they are still dismissing cases for reasons other than speedy-trial deadlines. For example, on Wednesday, Garbe moved to dismiss two cases, including a domestic violence assault, citing factors such as the weakness of the case and unavailable witnesses. A defense attorney had warned the cases were nearing the 120-day speedy-trial deadline, but Garbe said the timing was not the reason for the dismissals.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>In Anchorage, city prosecutors handle misdemeanor cases while state attorneys generally prosecute felonies. </p>\n\n<p>With the most serious felonies, the state has long dealt with problems apart from Anchorage\u2019s mass dismissals. The newsrooms reported in January that <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/anchorage-alaska-pretrial-delays-sexual-assault\">some of those cases</a> are delayed <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/alaska-sex-assault-case-delays-timeline/\">as long as a decade</a> before reaching trial. In March, the Alaska Supreme Court issued a <a href=\"https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/crime-courts/2025/03/25/alaska-supreme-court-places-new-limits-on-pretrial-delays/\">series of orders</a> aimed at reducing delays. </p>\n\n<p>District Court Judge Brian Clark cited the Supreme Court orders on Wednesday when asking attorneys if they were ready to go to trial, noting the pending deadline.</p>",

U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/4202494/remarks-by-secretary-of-defense-pete-hegseth-at-the-2025-shangri-la-dialogue-in/\" target=\"_blank\">warned recently</a> that an invasion \"could be imminent\", saying at a summit in Singapore at the end of May, that \"There's no reason to sugarcoat it: the threat China poses is real.\" The Defense Secretary also said that Beijing is \"credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific,\" adding, \"to be clear: any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world.\" Hegseth is not alone in believing that a Chinese invasion is inevitable as part of President Xi Jinping\u2019s plan to \u201cre-unify\u201d the island with mainland China. But it is also just part of a much broader strategy that long-term, poses significantly higher stakes.</p><p>As a result of the threat posed to U.S. national security, the CIA established the China Mission Center in 2021, with the aim of better coordinating the collection and analysis components of intelligence to better inform U.S. policymakers \u2013 and most importantly, the Agency\u2019s number one customer \u2013 the president of the United States \u2013 with the most accurate information possible about Xi Jingping\u2019s intent and timeline. Cipher Brief Expert Susan Miller, who retired from the CIA just a few months ago - where she served as the Assistant Director at the Center - told <em>The Cipher Brief</em> that Xi\u2019s intent is not only to forcefully reunify Taiwan. In fact, that\u2019s just the beginning.</p><p><strong>THE INTERVIEW</strong></p><p><em>Cipher Brief CEO & Publisher Suzanne Kelly talked with Miller about how U.S. intelligence is working to better understand what Xi is thinking. Our Subscriber+ interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><div class=\"expert-block-container expert-list\">\n<div class=\"expert-item\">\n<div class=\"expert-image\">\n<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/susan-miller\">\n<img alt=\"Susan Miller, Former Assistant Director of China Mission Center, CIA\" src=\"https://assets.rbl.ms/60329984/origin.jpg\" />\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"expert-description\">\n<h4 class=\"expert-name\">\n<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/susan-miller\">Susan Miller, Former Assistant Director of China Mission Center, CIA</a>\n</h4>\n<p class=\"expert-about\">\n        Miller spent 39 years at CIA as an operations officer, serving nine tours abroad, two as a Case Officer, one as Deputy Chief of Station and six tours as Chief of Station. She also served as assistant director of several mission centers at the Agency. \n      </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong></em><em><strong>What do you think it is that the American people need to understand about why China is posing a threat to U.S. national security and how they\u2019re doing it?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>He wants to absolutely replace the U.S. as the world leader, but he doesn't want to replace us as the world leader of democracy. He wants to replace us as the world influencer. He knows that we're going to go to war someday because he absolutely plans in the coming decade, if not in the shorter term, to invade Taiwan. And he absolutely knows that we would come to the defense of democracies around the world. So, in order to give him the edge, he has - not only in America but all around the globe - been able to get into national power grids. Just think, what could you do with that capability in a time of war? You turn off the power. We know he's in power grids in America and Europe and Africa and Asia.</p><p>Why? Because companies from the People\u2019s Republic of China underbid other companies. Now that ability is gone. That's something that the previous administration and the current administration both said, \u2018<em>we're not going to let anybody get at our current infrastructure\u2019</em>. But can you imagine if we decide to go to war to support Taiwan or we have to do it because something else has happened, can you imagine having no power in California or along the Eastern seaboard? And that's why we need to really care. And Xi Jinping\u2019s plan is to take us over bit by bit. There are some things that we have kind of let go, although we shouldn't have. One of them is that he has taken over U.S. influence in Africa and other developing countries.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> </strong><strong>China has certainly used its Belt and Road Initiative to moving into these areas and they're bringing money and they're bringing infrastructure and they're making day-to-day life better for the locals \u2013 at least in the short-term.</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Yes. They're doing what we used to do with USAID and with getting U.S. companies to kind of sign up and go do this, so that we could make sure we still get important minerals and so that we can make the widgets that we need to make from all of these countries. And then we also provide a platform where a democracy can at least start and maybe not ever be as robust as ours, but at least be better than what they have now. So, that's a real concern. China is stepping into a lot of these roles all over the world. And that bothers me because that should be us doing that.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> You\u2019ve also spent a lot of your professional career focused on the threat posed by Russia. Today, when you're comparing the China threat to the Russia threat, how are these threats different?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Can you name one thing you have ever bought that says Made in China? We all can, right? Have you ever even thought about buying a toaster oven made in Russia? The answer is no. And so I'm oversimplifying this a little bit because the bottom line is that with China, we have an integrated economic goal that might help them not want to go to war with us in a way that with Russia, we have nothing.</p><p>I lived in Moscow back in the Soviet days, and my American toaster broke so I went down to a department store and bought a Russian made toaster. I plugged it in and it caught fire the first time. And it is still like that. That's why they don't manufacture stuff. There are other things that they have there. They do have some minerals and some other things. They have a pretty good agriculture system that works not only for their own people, but for that area as well. But the bottom line is that Putin does not have the same kind of leverage over us as Xi Jinping has.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> He has nuclear deterrence, but he doesn't have economic deterrence. Everyone is watching to see what happens in the negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, the war that Russia clearly did start, clearly unprovoked. And as everyone follows the slow-moving headlines on this, I'm wondering if you think Vladimir Putin, who was a former spy himself, sees the world differently than a former businessman, which Donald Trump certainly has skills in the business world. But where do you see these two things potentially colliding in terms of how the U.S. needs to be approaching negotiating with someone like Putin?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Putin is not only a former intelligence guy from Russia. He also served as second chief directorate. And just to explain, first chief directorate spies, like CIA does, like MI6 does. You go overseas, you spot, assess, develop operations and things like that. The second chief directorate, they were the ones that put anybody who dared to say that the Soviet Union wasn't the best thing in the world into gulags. They also tortured people, dissidents, et cetera. And so he came from the nasty side of the KGB. And he's always been a believer in Russia having lost something under Yeltsin. And a guy like him - and there are a lot of them like him, just think of our version of white supremacists or white Nazi or American Nazis, things like that - that's their version. These are the people that support and work in the second chief directorate. So, that's the concern.</p><p>He doesn't care about human life. He doesn't care if his own people die in a war with Ukraine. He knows they're dying. And he knows that they're not making much progress and he's mad at his generals, but I can guarantee, in typical Russian \u2013 and I don't have absolute evidence of this because I don't have any exquisite intelligence on this - but he's probably underfunding them. They're probably not dressed well. There is still conscription going on there. And they're not that happy either. Whereas in Ukraine, they are fighting for their lives. And that, to me, is what is astounding Putin.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> The Cipher Brief has been briefed on reports from Ukrainians that captured Russian soldiers have relayed some of what they have been dealing with as are deployed to the front. A lot of them are reportedly untrained and in some cases, they reportedly didn't know who their commander was. So we know there's chaos within the ranks for sure. But we've seen something since the invasion of Ukraine that we hadn't seen on the world stage quite like this before, and that is this new friendship without any limits between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Does that concern you in a different way than these threats do on an individual basis?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>It does concern me, yes. It is concerning and it is different now that they claim they have this friendship without limits. But does any dictator really have a friend? Somebody they totally trust that they'll tell everything and vice versa? And if Xi Jinping says, \u2018<em>yes, of course I'll give you some some terrific bombs</em>,\u2019 and things like that, Xi also has to think about what kind of economic downturn is going to happen inside China if every country that sides with Ukraine - which is a lot of democracies around the world - says, \u2018<em>you know, we're going to start boycotting China\u2019</em>. That's one of the things he has to be extremely careful about.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> You stood up the China mission center for the CIA, which is something that didn\u2019t exist in this form prior. What do you think that should tell the American people about the importance of China and the importance of getting good intelligence on China?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>I was on my second tour in Israel when then-director [William] Burns came for a visit and during the long windy roads from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv, he mentioned that he had been talking with a China specialist at the agency and some others and said, \u2018<em>You know, I'm thinking we're not paying enough attention to China as the real strategic threat and even maybe a tactical one</em>\u2019, if you look at tactical being 10 years or less. And he said, \u2018<em>What do you think about that</em>?\u2019 I had been chief of East Asia division and chief in counter intelligence, and we had put Chinese spies behind bars. And I told him that we've been saying inside the agency for years, we are not paying enough attention to China. We were still dealing with remnants from 9/11 and Iraq and things like that, so I said, \u2018<em>I'm in\u2019</em>.</p><p>It took a while for us to figure it out and what we decided is that the China Mission Center owns property, that's going to be its own department. And so that's the China department basically, and Taiwan department at the agency. So that was one. Number two was we needed to look at the worldwide program. That's where we did the basically the external ops. And the goal was not only to work with stations - everything that we always do when we send out requirements - but we also needed to think about how we were going to do it a little bit differently so we had more success.</p><p>And so we started what we call STED, which is the Strategic Training and Education Department, which is kind of like TED talks, and they actually do a STED talk. And they're the ones that went out to every single mission center chief and built modules that really helped. So, that was the other thing that we did that was very different.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> A fascinating breakdown of how the intelligence community is prioritizing China as an intelligence target.</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em><em> </em></strong><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</strong></em></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>More countries aspire to be nuclear-weapons states, and we should prepare for this eventuality. That\u2019s why the Golden Dome missile defense initiative is timely and needed.</p><p>The war in Ukraine is a stark reminder that Ukraine giving up their nuclear weapons, pursuant to the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, in exchange for so-called security assurances, was a grave mistake. Indeed, If Ukraine retained any portion of its 1,900 nuclear warheads, would Russia have invaded Ukraine in 2014 and 2022 and risked a nuclear confrontation? Even a revanchist Vladimir Putin would have thought twice about the consequences of a nuclear war with Ukraine.</p><p>The 1968 Treaty on the non-proliferations of nuclear weapons (NPT) has been relatively effective in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology as the then-five nuclear-weapons states \u2013 the U.S. Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom \u2013 pursued nuclear disarmament. Over the years, however, Pakistan, India and North Korea have conducted nuclear tests and are now nuclear-weapons states, with Israel not acknowledging that they have nuclear weapons. North Korea was the only country to pull out of the NPT; the others never joined.</p><p>China refuses to enter any nuclear disarmament negotiations with the U.S. and Russia, while exponentially enhancing its nuclear-weapons arsenal. Since the failed Hanoi Summit in 2019, North Korea has raced to build more nuclear weapons and ballistic missile to deliver these weapons, to include a solid fuel Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) capable of targeting the whole of the U.S.</p><p>The U.S. and Israel just bombed Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow, given that Iran was enriching uranium at 60% purity, weeks away from the 90% purity for nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) May 31 report that stated Iran was in breach of its non-proliferation obligations and was denying monitors access to suspect nuclear sites reportedly contributed to the decision to bomb these sites.</p><p>Iran just announced that they were suspending cooperation with the IAEA until the safety of its nuclear facilities could be guaranteed.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It\u2019s never been more important to understand what\u2019s happening in the world. Upgrade your access to exclusive content by </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\"><em>becoming a subscriber</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p>Over 70% of South Koreans believe they need their own nuclear weapons, despite U.S. extended deterrent commitments. There\u2019s also a sense in Japan that eventually they also will need their own nuclear weapons, as a deterrent to North Korea and possibly China. The tension in the South and East China Seas and China\u2019s attempted intimidation of Taiwan are issues that will affect both Japan and South Korea. And indeed, an emboldened North Korea, now aligned with a revanchist Russian Federation, with a mutual defense treaty and North Korean troops in Russia participating in the war of aggression in Ukraine and receiving missile, satellite and nuclear support from Russia, may strike out at South Korea, in a conflict that could escalate quickly, to include the use of tactical nuclear weapons. Other countries in East Asia may feel compelled to also seek nuclear weapons, as a deterrent to any aggressor.</p><p>The same applies to the Middle East. Iran has been clear: They will continue to enrich uranium, despite the recent bombing of their nuclear facilities. But as a threshold nuclear weapons state, weeks away from fabricating nuclear weapons, calling for the annihilation of Israel, will there be a repeat of the U.S. and Israeli bombings? Will Iran now race to acquire nuclear weapons, especially now, given the removal of IAEA monitors?</p><p>Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey are very concerned about Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. Indeed, they may also feel a need to have their own nuclear weapons arsenal, for deterrent purposes. Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan publicly spoke about the unfairness of Turkey not having nuclear weapons as a deterrent given the precarious geopolitical situation in the region.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><em>Sign up today</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p>Our missile defense capabilities have lagged behind the advances in nuclear-weapons technology, especially the lethality of today\u2019s nuclear weapons that are eighty times more powerful than the atomic bombs used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p><p>There are currently over 13,000 nuclear weapons in the global stockpile of nuclear weapons, down from over 60,000 nuclear weapons during the Cold War. The New START arms control treaty between the U.S. and the Russian Federation, responsible for this reduction in nuclear weapons, expires on February 5, 2026, and Russia has refused to engage substantively on a successor to New START. So, what follows is uncertainty.</p><p>What is certain is that China will continue to build more nuclear weapons, with Beijing estimated to have over 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030; and North Korea, currently estimated to have over 50 nuclear warheads, is determined to build more nuclear weapons; and Iran is determined to remain a threshold nuclear-weapons state, weeks away from having nuclear weapons.</p><p>If South Korea and Japan and others in East Asia and if Saudi Arabia and Turkey and others in the Middle East decide to go nuclear, the global stockpile of nuclear weapons will increase exponentially. We also know that terrorist organizations, like Al-Qaeda, previously attempted to buy a nuclear weapon or radiological materials for a dirty bomb. And there may be countries willing to sell these weapons and radiological materials, or unable to securely store these weapons and materials that, then, are acquired by a rogue state or terrorist organization.</p><p>These are just some of the reasons why a Golden Dome <sub></sub>missile defense system is needed. Deploying space-based sensors and interceptors is no longer the Star Wars (Strategic Defense Initiative) that President Reagan pursued in 1983. We now have the technology and a budget of $175 billion to establish a viable missile defense capability hopefully within three years. We owe the American people security from the threat of a bad actor using nuclear weapons to attack the U.S.</p><p><em><strong>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/9/golden-dome-missile-defense-essential-americas-survival/\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Times</a></strong></em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business</strong></em><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>",

Most of the groups operate as crisis pregnancy centers, or pregnancy resource centers, which often resemble medical clinics but are frequently criticized for offering little or no actual health care and misleading women about their options.</p>\n\n<p>In its 20 years of existence, the program\u2019s funding has grown fortyfold \u2014 reaching $100 million a year starting Sept. 1 \u2014 making it the most heavily funded effort of its kind in the country.</p>\n\n<p>Under new rules set to take effect then, the organizations in the program must now document all of their expenses, and they will be reimbursed only for costs tied to services approved by the state. And they cannot seek reimbursement when they redistribute donated items, an effort to prevent taxpayer money from going to organizations for goods they got for free.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Texas is opening administration of the program to a <a href=\"https://resources.hhs.texas.gov/rfa/hhs0015167\">competitive selection process</a> instead of automatically renewing agreements with contractors, including one contractor that has overseen most of the program for nearly two decades.</p>\n\n<p>The changes address failures uncovered a year ago by the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-funding-anti-abortion-crisis-pregnancy-centers\">ProPublica/CBS News investigation</a>. As Thriving Texas Families currently operates, most providers are paid a flat rate for each service they claim to provide, regardless of the actual cost of that service. As a result, a single client visit can generate multiple stacked charges, significantly increasing the amount of public money being spent. In some cases, providers billed separately for each item or service given to a client \u2014 such as diapers, baby clothes, blankets, wipes, snacks and even educational pamphlets \u2014 according to records reviewed by ProPublica and CBS News.</p>\n\n<p>That arrangement allowed organizations to bill the state for more than the services actually cost to provide \u2014 and keep the difference. One group, Sealy Pregnancy Resource Center, more than quintupled its assets in three years by banking some reimbursements. Its executive director, Patricia Penner, acknowledged the practice, saying her goal was \u201cto make sure we have enough for this center to continue and to continue for the years to come.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee the funds we receive is going to be sufficient to keep the center going,\u201d Penner added, \u201cand it\u2019s my duty as a director to ensure we are taking whatever service funds we are receiving to ensure we can take care of these young ladies when they come in the door.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Two others, McAllen Pregnancy Center and Pregnancy Center of the Coastal Bend in Corpus Christi, used reimbursements to finance real estate deals. The McAllen center, which receives nearly all its revenue from the state, <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2022/11/04/texas-abortion-clinic-pregnancy-crisis-center/\">bought a building</a> that had previously housed an abortion clinic. The Coastal Bend center <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/31/pregnancy-center-of-the-coastal-bend-expansion/\">openly acknowledged using state funds</a> to buy land for a new facility. The centers did not respond to questions.</p>\n\n<p>In San Antonio, Thriving Texas Families cut off funding to a pregnancy center known as A New Life for a New Generation after a local news outlet reported it had <a href=\"https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2022/03/14/after-defenders-investigation-san-antonio-nonprofit-shuts-down-east-side-location/\">spent taxpayer money on vacations</a>, on a motorcycle and to fund a smoke shop business owned by its president and CEO. The center did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>ProPublica and CBS News also found that state health officials had no visibility into what services were being delivered or whether they were reaching the people most in need. In many cases, the state reimbursed providers $14 each time they handed out donated goods or materials, regardless of their cost or how they got them.</p>\n\n<p>That included distributing pamphlets on parenting, fetal development and adoption, which could trigger the same reimbursement as providing tangible aid like diapers or formula. The state could not say exactly how much it had spent on these materials because it did not track what was being distributed.</p>\n\n<p>State-approved pamphlets and lessons reviewed by a reporter stated inaccuracies \u2014 such as that a fetal heartbeat starts 21 days after conception \u2014 and painted single motherhood as risky and lonely, with marriage or adoption as better options.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>While flat-rate reimbursement is sometimes used in government contracting, nonprofit and accounting experts said applying it to the distribution of donated goods \u2014 without clear standards for quantity or value \u2014 was highly irregular.</p>\n\n<p>Officials with the state Health and Human Services Commission, which oversees Thriving Texas Families, did not say what prompted the policy shift, only that it was following guidance from the state comptroller. That guidance recommends awarding state grants as reimbursements for actual expenses.</p>\n\n<p>The state has long allowed its main contractor, Texas Pregnancy Care Network, to handle most of the program\u2019s oversight. The network told the news organizations last year that once state funds were passed to subcontractors, \u201cit is no longer taxpayer money\u201d and those groups were free to spend it as they saw fit. HHSC pushed back against the network, saying it still considered the money to be taxpayer dollars and expected it to be used in line with state guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>The shift to a cost-reimbursement model appears to bring the program more in line with how public money is typically distributed across state agencies in Texas.</p>\n\n<p>Texas Pregnancy Care Network, which in recent years has received nearly 75% of the Thriving Texas Families funding and distributed it to dozens of crisis pregnancy centers, faith-based groups and other charities that serve as subcontractors, did not respond to questions about how it plans to approach the new contract or adapt to the stricter reimbursement rules.</p>\n\n<p>State Rep. Donna Howard, a Democrat from Austin and a vocal critic of the state\u2019s support for anti-abortion programs, said in an interview that while she opposes taxpayer support for anti-abortion programs, she sees the new rules as a step in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p>But with the new reimbursement requirements in place, Howard questioned whether many of the centers would even be able to make use of the funding. Unlike the previous flat-fee system, providers must now track costs, document services and submit receipts to justify their spending. \u201cWho knows if they can actually use the funds now that they have to show receipts,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>By requiring pregnancy centers to track clients\u2019 income, education level and employment \u2014 and to provide clients with information about public benefits available to them \u2014 the state is moving away from a system that allowed nonprofits to collect funds without regard for who was receiving help.</p>\n\n<p>Pregnancy resource centers and anti-abortion activists lobbied Republican lawmakers to block the policy change during the most recent legislative session, and some publicly denounced it.</p>\n\n<p>On the social media platform X, Rep. Jeff Leach, a Republican from the northern Dallas suburbs, urged the agency to \u201cnot give veto power\u201d over the program \u201cto biased media reporters.\u201d Leach did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>In an interview, Texas Right to Life President John Seago warned that the new reimbursement model would discourage participation. He said it was \u201cnot worth small providers getting into the program because of all the red tape.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And in written testimony, Penner, from Sealy, implored legislators to <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/publiccomments/billhistory/SB01388H.pdf\">preserve the current model</a>, saying it allowed her team \u201cto focus on serving our clients rather than staffing up in order to handle the paperwork\u201d required for reimbursement.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the pushback, lawmakers did not take action to block the new rules.</p>\n\n<p>Ge Bai, a professor of accounting and health policy at Johns Hopkins University, said switching to a cost-reimbursement system could help prevent waste by making sure organizations only get paid for what they actually spend.</p>\n\n<p>But she warned that this model has its own risks. Since providers know they will be reimbursed, they might not be as careful about keeping costs down \u2014 or could even inflate their expenses to get more money. She pointed to Medicare, which used a similar system in the past but abandoned it after costs spiraled out of control.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid the same problem, she said, the program will need strong public oversight to make sure organizations aren\u2019t overspending just because they know the state will cover the bill.</p>\n\n<p>One reproductive health policy specialist who has closely tracked Texas\u2019 spending on crisis pregnancy centers cautioned that the reforms do little to address the broader gaps in the state\u2019s social safety net.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really make up for a lack of Medicaid health insurance for the very poor in Texas by giving people educational services, pamphlets and diapers,\u201d said Laura Dixon, a researcher with Resound Research for Reproductive Health, based in Austin.</p>\n\n<p>But at the very least, she said, \u201cunderstanding where money is going is a really good first step for this program.\u201d</p>",

Then, colliding with another soggy system sliding north off the Pacific, the storm wobbled and its clouds tipped, waterboarding south central Texas with an extraordinary 20 inches of rain. In the predawn blackness, the Guadalupe River, which drains from the Hill Country, rose by more than 26 vertical feet in just 45 minutes, jumping its banks and hurtling downstream, killing 109 people, including at least 27 children at a summer camp located inside a federally designated floodway.</p>\n\n<p>Over the days and weeks to come there will be tireless \u2014 and warranted \u2014 analysis of who is to blame for this heart-wrenching loss. Should Kerr County, where most of the deaths occurred, have installed warning sirens along that stretch of the waterway, and why were children allowed to sleep in an area prone to high-velocity flash flooding? Why were urgent updates apparently only conveyed by cellphone and online in a rural area with limited connectivity? Did the National Weather Service, enduring steep budget cuts under the current administration, adequately forecast this storm?</p>\n\n<p>Those questions are critical. But so is a far larger concern: The rapid onset of disruptive climate change \u2014 driven by the burning of oil, gasoline and coal \u2014 is making disasters like this one more common, more deadly and far more costly to Americans, even as the federal government is running away from the policies and research that might begin to address it.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>President <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/3227654/PSAC-1965-Restoring-the-Quality-of-Our-Environment.pdf\">Lyndon B. Johnson was briefed</a> in 1965 that a climate crisis was being caused by burning fossil fuels and was warned that it would create the conditions for intensifying storms and extreme events, and this country \u2014 including 10 more presidents \u2014 has debated how to respond to that warning ever since. Still, it took decades for the slow-motion change to grow large enough to affect people\u2019s everyday lives and safety and for the world to reach the stage it is in now: an age of climate-driven chaos, where the past is no longer prologue and the specific challenges of the future might be foreseeable but are less predictable. </p>\n\n<p>Climate change doesn\u2019t chart a linear path where each day is warmer than the last. Rather, science suggests that we\u2019re now in an age of discontinuity, with heat one day and hail the next and with more dramatic extremes. Across the planet, dry places are getting drier while wet places are getting wetter. The jet stream \u2014 the band of air that circulates through the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 is slowing to a near stall at times, weaving off its tracks, causing unprecedented events like polar vortexes drawing arctic air far south. Meanwhile the heat is sucking moisture from the drought-plagued plains of Kansas only to dump it over Spain, contributing to last year\u2019s cataclysmic floods.</p>\n\n<p>We saw something similar when Hurricane Harvey dumped as much as 60 inches of rain on parts of Texas in 2017 and when Hurricane Helene devastated North Carolina last year \u2014 and countless times in between. We witnessed it again in Texas this past weekend. Warmer oceans evaporate faster, and warmer air holds more water, transporting it in the form of humidity across the atmosphere, until it can\u2019t hold it any longer and it falls. Meteorologists estimate that the atmosphere had reached its capacity for moisture before the storm struck.</p>\n\n<p>The disaster comes during a week in which extreme heat and extreme weather have battered the planet. Parts of northern Spain and southern France are burning out of control, as are parts of California. In the past 72 hours, storms have torn the roofs off of five-story apartment buildings in Slovakia, while intense rainfall has turned streets into rivers in southern Italy. Same story in Lombok, Indonesia, where cars floated like buoys, and in eastern China, where an inland typhoon-like storm sent furniture blowing down the streets like so many sheafs of paper. L\u00e9on, Mexico, was battered by hail so thick on Monday it covered the city in white. And North Carolina is, again, enduring 10 inches of rainfall.</p>\n\n<p>There is no longer much debate that climate change is making many of these events demonstrably worse. Scientists conducting a rapid analysis of last week\u2019s extreme heat wave that spread across Europe have concluded that human-caused warming killed roughly 1,500 more people than might have otherwise perished. Early reports suggest that the flooding in Texas, too, was substantially influenced by climate change. According to <a href=\"https://www.climameter.org/20250704-texas-floods?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-84B4b5mdW3DXc8sB902N4jq-09-zJ9MvQW8nFsRUtJduhbaznp2w8RKVqS6AfdZDSSs5BtWMnzIHk7pQGWl-YMY5AvAmT5Nd0UsdcQ4Wl7nDvcDQ4&amp;_hsmi=112926468&amp;utm_content=112926468&amp;utm_source=hs_email\">a preliminary analysis</a> by ClimaMeter, a joint project of the European Union and the French National Centre for Scientific Research, the weather in Texas was 7% wetter on July 4 than it was before climate change warmed that part of the state, and natural variability alone cannot explain \u201cthis very exceptional meteorological condition.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That the United States once again is reeling from familiar but alarming headlines and body counts should not be a surprise by now. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the number of extreme weather disasters has jumped fivefold worldwide over the past 50 years, and the number of deaths has nearly tripled. In the United States, which prefers to measure its losses in dollars, the damage from major storms was more than $180 billion last year, nearly 10 times the average annual toll during the 1980s, after accounting for inflation. These storms have now cost Americans nearly $3 trillion. Meanwhile, the number of annual major disasters has grown sevenfold. Fatalities in billion-dollar storms last year alone were nearly equal to the number of such deaths counted by the federal government in the 20 years between 1980 and 2000.</p>\n\n<p>The most worrisome fact, though, may be that the warming of the planet has scarcely begun. Just as each step up on the Richter scale represents a massive increase in the force of an earthquake, the damage caused by the next 1 or 2 degrees Celsius of warming stands to be far greater than that caused by the 1.5 degrees we have so far endured. The world\u2019s leading scientists, the United Nations panel on climate change and even many global energy experts warn that we face something akin to our last chance before it is too late to curtail a runaway crisis. It\u2019s one reason our predictions and modeling capabilities are becoming an essential, lifesaving mechanism of national defense.</p>\n\n<p>What is extraordinary is that at such a volatile moment, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration would choose not just to minimize the climate danger \u2014 and thus the suffering of the people affected by it \u2014 but to revoke funding for the very data collection and research that would help the country better understand and prepare for this moment.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past couple of months, the administration has <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-noaa-budget-cuts-climate-change-modeling-princeton-gfdl\">defunded much of the operations of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, the nation\u2019s chief climate and scientific agency responsible for weather forecasting, as well as the cutting-edge earth systems research at places like Princeton University, which is essential to modeling an aberrant future. It has canceled the nation\u2019s seminal scientific assessment of climate change and risk. The administration has defunded the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s core program paying for infrastructure projects meant to prevent major disasters from causing harm, and it has threatened to eliminate FEMA itself, the main federal agency charged with helping Americans after a climate emergency like the Texas floods. It has \u2014 as of last week \u2014 signed legislation that unravels the federal programs meant to slow warming by helping the country\u2019s industries transition to cleaner energy. And it has even stopped the reporting of the cost of disasters, stating that doing so is \u201cin alignment with evolving priorities\u201d of the administration. It is as if the administration hopes that making the price tag for the Kerr County flooding invisible would make the events unfolding there seem less devastating.</p>\n\n<p>Given the abandonment of policy that might forestall more severe events like the Texas floods by reducing the emissions that cause them, Americans are left to the daunting task of adapting. In Texas, it is critical to ask whether the protocols in place at the time of the storm were good enough. This week is not the first time that children have died in a flash flood along the Guadalupe River, and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/officials-pushed-for-better-warning-system-years-before-devastating-texas-floods-0143b5f1?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAg8PDihhju1lXQFVwJ73c4mJ5pL-YE_DmjCsUN5l-VW-vekKsrhZQswe00fUyE%3D&amp;gaa_ts=686d3ab1&amp;gaa_sig=prM9v_8AJkqqP4diI96LSicw4bJ5xX8tS8MkM0Jk8HKRh383rMddafuvlj68c62bueT4VkLOjBpNC_KoVRqPrg%3D%3D\">reports suggest</a> county officials struggled to raise money and then declined to install a warning system in 2018 in order to save approximately $1 million. But the country faces a larger and more daunting challenge, because this disaster \u2014 like the firestorms in Los Angeles and the hurricanes repeatedly pummeling Florida and the southeast \u2014 once again raises the question of where people can continue to safely live. It might be that in an era of what researchers are calling \u201cmega rain\u201d events, a flood plain should now be off-limits.</p>",

For her troubles, she received a one-time payment of $770 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which she used to replace clothes, food and a crate for her dog. While it was only a fraction of what she needed, the money was at least available while she waited for other funding.</p>\n\n<p>As an organizer with the Altadena Tenants Union who has been helping renters with their FEMA applications, Clark knows just how common her experience has been for fire survivors. She believes federal and local agencies <a href=\"https://chu.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/chu.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/final-letter-to-fema-regarding-federal-housing-programs-for-los-angeles-fire-survivors.pdf\">severely underestimated</a> the need and cost of housing for the 150,000 people displaced by the fires, leaving many still struggling to recover. A FEMA spokesperson denied the accusation, saying the agency\u2019s \u201congoing assessments indicate that the current Rental Assistance program is effectively meeting the housing needs of survivors eligible for FEMA assistance.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The disaster response \u201chas been so shockingly bad,\u201d Clark said, but she recognizes that without FEMA\u2019s help in responding to fires that killed at least <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/death-toll-from-the-wildfires-that-tore-through-the-los-angeles-area-reaches-30/\">30 people</a> and destroyed more than <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/la-wildfires-aftermath-insurance-housing-rebuild-update/story?id=119209482\">16,000 structures</a>, \u201cit could have been so, so, so much worse.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe would have seen a whole lot more people left to their own devices. And what that would mean is homelessness. It would mean people just abandoned,\u201d Clark said.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Even before President Donald Trump and Gov. Gavin Newsom squared off over Trump\u2019s decision to send National Guard troops to quell immigration protests, before Newsom likened Trump to a dictator and Trump endorsed the idea of arresting the governor, the question of how much California could continue to rely on FEMA was front and center.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s a critical question in a state \u2014 with its earthquakes, wildfires, floods, drought and extreme heat \u2014 that frequently suffers <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/mapping\">some of the costliest disasters</a> in the country.</p>\n\n<p>Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, his administration has floated sweeping proposals that would slash FEMA dollars and make disasters harder to declare. This has left both blue and red states wrestling with scenarios in which they must pay for what FEMA will not. States have long counted on FEMA to cover at least 75% of declared major disaster response and recovery costs.</p>\n\n<p>In just the past few months, FEMA has denied federal assistance for devastating <a href=\"https://westvirginiawatch.com/2025/04/29/femas-refusal-to-help-some-west-virginia-counties-just-a-taste-of-whats-to-come/\">floods in West Virginia</a> and a destructive <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/04/14/trump-s-fema-denies-washington-disaster-relief-for-bomb-cyclone-windstorm/\">windstorm in Washington</a>. The agency approved such funding for deadly tornadoes in Arkansas after Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appealed an initial denial and <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/sarah-sanders-begs-her-old-150513581.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANHkWGyIK7o9Y3LWrcxxb6F2T-vnrsTIgYBEbrPQ_V3HFmbM4_7LCx4KhiFlLWI1Jq_W1nZ_Wna8RiCw6VPiyV_Khsb2FzJCCSphNAilh4BVev2ewwIlzPakKwNVMF8_zilLuXw1fn7cDf5viYCCG2ZertlViMekUGyJOS75GLNF\">personally begged</a> the president for help.</p>\n\n<p>Last month, ProPublica reported that <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/fema-grants-trump-emergencies\">FEMA missed a May deadline</a> to open the application process for many grants, including funding that states rely on to pay for basic emergency management operations. The delay, which the agency has not explained, appears to have little precedent.</p>\n\n<p>In California, Trump has cast doubt on whether he will approve the $40 billion Newsom <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-wildfires-newsom-federal-aid-71ec591a60c05d45432382095dbfd147\">has requested</a> to help pay for recovery costs associated with the fires, including $16.8 billion from FEMA to rebuild property, infrastructure and remove debris. That\u2019s on top of the almost $140 million the agency has already provided to individual survivors.</p>\n\n<p>The president told reporters last month that states need to be weaned off FEMA and that the federal government will start distributing less federal aid after hurricane season ends in November.</p>\n\n<p>The questions now are: How much will be approved? Will it be enough? And, if not, what then?</p>\n\n<p>A FEMA spokesperson did not directly respond to questions from Capital &amp; Main about anticipated funding cuts and potential impacts on state and local communities, but said the agency \u201casserts that disasters are best managed when they\u2019re federally supported, state managed and locally executed.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The uncertainty makes it \u201cvery hard\u201d to plan, said Heather Gonzalez, principal fiscal and policy analyst for emergency services at California\u2019s Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. \u201cThe little bean-counters in the back are stressing out right now trying to figure out \u2018what are we going to have to work with?\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The recent \u201cdust-ups\u201d between Newsom and Trump, she said, have only underscored the unpredictability. For his part, Newsom said he prefers the \u201copen hand\u201d of cooperation over the \u201cclosed fist\u201d of fighting when it comes to disaster response.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEmergency preparedness and emergency planning, recovery and renewal \u2014 period, full stop \u2014 that should be nonpolitical,\u201d he said on Monday, which marked six months since the fires.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            A firefighter battles a blaze in Altadena during the Eaton Fire.\n    \n            (Jeremy Lindenfeld/Capital &amp;amp; Main)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \nThe Rising Cost of Disasters\n<p>Since at least the 1980s, California has endured a rapidly growing number of billion-dollar disasters, with <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/state-summary/CA#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20California%20has%20experienced,billion%20%2D%20a%20new%20U.S.%20record\">18 occurring</a> between 2015 and 2024 alone.</p>\n\n<p>As the frequency and severity of California\u2019s disasters increase, so too does its reliance on federal assistance to respond. In the aftermath of January\u2019s Eaton and Palisades fires \u2014 <a href=\"https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top20_destruction_061925.pdf?rev=44aa48ce19614b759d44cf02380f34a5&amp;hash=59939EF7BE88548E2E8B4D718F060531\">the second and third most destructive wildfires</a> in California history, respectively \u2014 FEMA has already provided $139 million for everything from home repair costs to medical expenses, and the agency \u201chas allocated billions of dollars for debris removal,\u201d according to a FEMA spokesperson. <a href=\"https://news.caloes.ca.gov/more-than-5000-properties-complete-in-wildfire-debris-removal-effort/\">Over 5,000 properties</a> have already been cleared of ash and fire debris.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            The ruins of a bank that was destroyed in the Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades. The wildfire was the third most destructive in California history.\n    \n            (Sarahbeth Maney/ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management Communications Director Emily Montanez said recovery efforts for the fires likely won\u2019t be complete for many years and are heavily dependent on FEMA.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAfter the Northridge earthquake in 1994, FEMA had field offices here for 28 years,\u201d Montanez said. \u201cWe see this as being no different. This was way more devastation, way more impact. So this could be years, definitely decades.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>While Montanez acknowledged that potential \u201cgaps\u201d in disaster response efforts leave some survivors without sufficient resources, she said that the recent operations coordinated between FEMA and local agencies in Los Angeles have mostly been efficient and successful.</p>\n\n<p>FEMA\u2019s federal assistance supplements California\u2019s own disaster response and mitigation resources like those allocated to the <a href=\"https://www.caloes.ca.gov/\">Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services</a>, which was allotted $4.4 billion in the May revision of the <a href=\"https://ebudget.ca.gov/FullBudgetSummary.pdf\">state\u2019s 2025-26 budget</a>. When the office\u2019s funding does not cover all disaster costs, California can also pull from a number of its reserves, including the Budget Stabilization Account and Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties.</p>\n\n<p>Newsom told Capital &amp; Main on Monday that the state has increased its discretionary reserves as a direct consequence of Trump\u2019s ongoing threats to FEMA, though he admitted that even that increased investment wouldn\u2019t make up for the potential loss in federal funding. </p>\n\n<p>California \u201ccan\u2019t backfill the elimination of FEMA,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThere\u2019s no state in America [that can], even the most endowed state \u2014 $4.1 trillion a year economy \u2014 largest in the nation, fourth largest in the world.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>And California\u2019s <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/05/california-budget-revision-may-2025/\">$12 billion budget deficit</a> will make backfilling the office\u2019s shortfall especially difficult the next time a major disaster strikes, according to Laurie Schoeman, senior adviser on climate resilience to former President Joe Biden.</p>\n\n<p>That will be made even harder if the still-unfinalized proposals outlined in <a href=\"https://lisamillerassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FEMA-OMB_Memo_FEMA_Rebalance_250423.pdf\">an internal FEMA memo</a> are implemented, according to Schoeman. One of the reforms floated in the memo caps the proportion of recovery costs covered by the federal government at the current baseline of 75%. Under current rules, the president can increase FEMA\u2019s cost share up to 100%, as <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/01/09/californias-partnership-with-federal-government-boosts-states-rapid-response-to-los-angeles-fires/\">Biden did</a> for the Los Angeles fires less than two weeks before he left office.</p>\n\n<p>Another proposal quadruples the amount of damage that needs to be suffered in a disaster before FEMA awards any public assistance grants for infrastructure repair and debris removal. That would hike California\u2019s damage threshold from roughly $75 million to nearly $300 million per disaster.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>Had just that second reform been in place between 2008 and 2024, California would have received 26% less in public assistance funding from FEMA, a loss of nearly $2 billion, according to <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/proposed-cuts-federal-disaster-assistance-will-hit-states-just-hurricane-season-ramps#:~:text=Last%20week%2C%20CNN%20reported%20that,the%20same%2016%2Dyear%20period.\">a May analysis</a> by the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.</p>\n\n<p>Such reduced funding during future events would cause an \u201capocalyptic scenario\u201d where California communities would struggle to afford the cost of running shelters and paying for emergency responders to rescue disaster victims, according to Sarah Labowitz, a senior fellow in the Sustainability, Climate, and Geopolitics Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p>\n\n<p>Yet already, significant damage has been done, Schoeman said.</p>\n\n<p>In April, the Trump administration canceled the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, a FEMA initiative dedicated to funding disaster-preparedness projects. Over $880 million in federal funding was rescinded, including a $35 million grant in California\u2019s Napa County largely dedicated to wildfire prevention work. The administration declined to respond to Capital &amp; Main\u2019s request for comment, referring questions to FEMA. An agency spokesperson said that its approach to disaster preparedness mirrors that of disaster response: FEMA will play a supporting role.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAll types of preparedness start with families, individuals and local and state officials ahead of any emergency and disaster,\u201d a statement from the agency said.</p>\n\n<p>The rescinded federal funding risks undermining communities\u2019 abilities to protect against future disasters, Schoeman said, and undoes work accomplished under Trump\u2019s first term.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re just cutting these projects even though they have proven benefit cost analyses in place,\u201d Schoeman said. \u201cThe BRIC program was started under the Trump administration \u2026 so it feels like the administration is going to cut their own leg off.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Smoke drifts over Will Rogers State Beach and the Pacific Ocean during the Palisades Fire.\n    \n            (Jeremy Lindenfeld/Capital &amp;amp; Main)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Clark said she is already struggling to get help. She said her insurance provider has so far withheld over $25,000 due to disagreements over whether her transitional housing qualifies as temporary, and her applications for additional FEMA assistance have been denied due to her technically being insured. Some wealthier survivors had \u201cthe insulation and resiliency that economic resources give you,\u201d while others had to depend on nonprofits or the kind of government assistance that is now at risk to afford transitional housing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have those economic resources, your only option is to turn to either philanthropy or the state,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIf neither of those are available, then tough luck.\u201d</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>FINE PRINT / OPINION \u2014 </strong>\u201cThis report explores the environmental effects and societal and economic consequences that would be expected to follow in the weeks-to-decades after a nuclear war. The exploration begins\u2026with the consideration of four plausible scenarios for the employment of nuclear weapons, along with description of the immediate effects of the energy release and blast from a nuclear detonation.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s an excerpt from Chapter 2 of a new congressionally-mandated study from the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) entitled, <em><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/independent-study-on-potential-environmental-effects-of-nuclear-war\" target=\"_blank\">Potential Environmental Effects of Nuclear War</a></em></em>, that was released online June 25.</p><p>Because I have written extensively about nuclear weapons, including in my 2021 book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/403ad3K\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Blown To Hell</em>,</a> which is about radioactive fallout on the Marshall Islanders from the Bikini thermonuclear Bravo test in 1954, I was surprised to read <span style=\"background-color: initial;\">that \u201cevaluation of radioactive fallout was not included in the scope of the work.\u201d That apparently was because so much had already been published about the impact of radiation and radioactivity from nuclear weapons.</span></p><p>This new NAS study focuses primarily on the release of thermal energy (heat) from a nuclear explosion in the lower atmosphere, as well as kinetic energy (blast) and the air shockwave caused by the latter. A nuclear detonation in the atmosphere, where the fireball does not hit the ground, releases some 35 percent of its energy in heat; another 50 percent in blast and shock wave, and the remaining 15 percent of energy in radiation.</p><p>Nonetheless, I believe the study is worth exploring, if only, for example, to see the \u201cfour plausible scenarios\u201d the expert writers see that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. In addition, studies such as these often disclose facts not normally available.</p><p>There were a series of scientific studies in the 1980s that raised concern about large-scale nuclear exchanges leading to \u201cnuclear winter\u201d scenarios. They showed that nearly every country in the world would be affected, beyond those in conflict. In those studies, nuclear use by superpowers caused immense firestorms whose light-blocking soot and particulates reduced sunlight to disrupt worldwide agriculture and ecosystems for years.</p><p>I believe reminders such as that make all such studies valuable, because they can reduce the likelihood of any nuclear weapon use. The authors of this new study apparently feel that way since they wrote, \u201cWith growing risks of nuclear proliferation and evolving warfare doctrines, this renewed scientific examination aims to quantify the grave global stakes should such hostilities occur in the current and future security environments.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Sign up for the </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Cyber Initiatives Group</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

They are the United Kingdom with an estimated 225 weapons; France with 290; India with 160; Pakistan with 170; China with 500 and growing; and North Korea with 50.</p><p>I must point out here that the NAS has omitted Israel, which has some 90 or more nuclear weapons, according to experts such as Hans Kristensen and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The U.S. Government and apparently the NAS follow Israeli policy of ambiguity, neither confirming nor denying their nuclear weapons exist, although they have had them since the late-1960s. Israel even has sub-launched, nuclear-tipped cruise missiles as well as nuclear bombs and land-based missiles.</p><p>In its study, the NAS presents what it describes as four plausible scenarios for nuclear weapon use:</p><p>Large-scale strategic usage of 2,000 warheads, where the scenario is that the Russia/U.S. nuclear exchanges begin at the tactical level, but escalate to the strategic level;</p><p>Moderate-scale strategic exchange of 400 warheads, where the scenario is a China/U.S. conflict;</p><p>Small-scale regional conflict of 150 warheads, such as one between Pakistan and India;</p><p>Very small-scale use of a single warhead, to \u201cdemonstrate resolve\u201d and \u201ca willingness to employ nuclear weapons.\u201d This scenario seems to follow the Russian strategy of \u201cescalate to de-escalate,\u201d that initially appeared in the past decade.</p><p>The NAS study says it has proposed these scenarios in order \u201cto study potential environmental inputs,\u201d though the study also \u201crecommends further development of a more comprehensive set of scenarios.\u201d</p><p>I should point out that I have been told that in U.S. military wargaming, when the scenario leads to one side using a nuclear weapon and escalation begins, the game usually ends because no one is prepared to say where nuclear exchanges are going or how to stop them.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

But the study notes that \u201cwhile some military targets are likely in or near urban areas, present-day [nuclear] weapons are generally more accurate and are of lower yields, which would likely reduce the impact on civilian structures.\u201d</p><p>Hiroshima, the Japanese target for the first U.S. atomic bomb, was described in a 1945 pre-attack U.S. government document put together by Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s Target Committee as \u201can important depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged.\u201d</p><p>The point was then, and I believe it remains now, that any decision to use a nuclear weapon is in recognition that its use would destroy property and kill many people, both military and civilian. Remember, some 70,000 people were killed at Hiroshima with thousands more dying later from effects of that one atomic bomb.</p><p>The NAS study points out, \u201cFollowing a nuclear blast [totaling one megaton], there are two surface-temperature pulses and two pulses of thermal radiation from the fireball.\u201d The first thermal pulse lasts just one-tenth of a second but is \u201ccapable of permanent or temporary effects on the eyes.\u201d</p><p>The second thermal pulse may last up to ten seconds and \u201ccarries about 99 percent of total thermal radiation energy\u2026 This radiation is the main cause of skin burns up to 12 miles or more away, and of eye effects at even greater distance. The radiation from the second pulse can also cause fires to start under suitable conditions.\u201d There was a firestorm at Hiroshima.</p><p>When it comes to the blast effect from nuclear weapons, the NAS study says, \u201cMost thermal radiation reaches material in advance of the blast wave,\u201d something that is not generally understood. The study adds, \u201cThe blast can extinguish flames, but can also leave smoldering material and rubble which can grow into larger fires. Blast waves can cause damage that results in secondary ignitions, thus being an additional source of fire starts.\u201d</p><p>Within the city limits of Hiroshima, 92 percent of all buildings were destroyed or damaged. Of that number, 63 percent were completely destroyed by fire, with only 5 percent completely destroyed only by blast.</p><p>The NAS study describes agriculture and food production as among the economic consequences of nuclear weapon usage, saying there \u201ccan be extensive direct and indirect impacts\u2026with far-reaching consequences for immediate and long-term food security.\u201d</p><p>In one of several radiation mentions, the NAS study says, \u201cRadioactive fallout, pollution, and habitat destruction could contribute to the decline of various plant and animal species, disrupting ecosystem services crucial for maintaining soil fertility, pest control and ecosystem health. This could further challenge agricultural systems to recover and adapt to the new post-war conditions.\u201d</p><p>I saw first-hand in the Marshall Islands in the 1970s that decades after being subjected to radioactive fallout from a powerful thermonuclear weapon ground-burst more than 100 miles away, plants grown on land and shellfish from the sea still showed radioactivity that made them dangerous to eat.</p><p>There is a footnote in the NAS study scenarios section that mentions so-called countervalue nuclear targets, which it describes as \u201ccivilian and cultural targets, population centers and infrastructure.\u201d In other words, they are urban or suburban civilian-populated areas.</p><p>That footnote adds: \u201cIn some sense, countervalue targets can be understood to be punitive or for revenge; however, these terms are currently considered out-dated and inappropriate with current U.S. nuclear strategy.\u201d</p><p>As I noted earlier, Oppenheimer and his Target Committee saw their massively powerful atomic bombs as devices to end a war, not fight one. In my terms, in 1945 they understood that their new nuclear bombs were terror weapons, designed to show how many buildings could be destroyed and people killed with a single bomb.</p><p>And I believe now, however one talks about nuclear weapons and no matter the number they have, they remain today terror weapons \u2014 and that is what deters their use today \u2013 at least against a nation that has its own nuclear weapons or is allied with such a nation.</p><p><em><strong><em>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

It\u2019s another indicator that beneath the surface calm of Taiwan\u2019s vibrant cities, a more profound change is taking shape and in government halls, military installations, and civil society groups. A growing sense of urgency is quietly emerging.</p><p>China\u2019s preparation for a potential invasion is no longer a distant possibility but a reality rapidly coming into focus \u2014and defense planners are grappling with a pressing question: how and when will Washington act?</p><p>\u201cTaiwan is incredibly reliant upon U.S. support for both deterrence against China, as well as a war-fighting invasion scenario,\u201d Kitsch Liao, associate director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global China Hub, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThe U.S. is the sole arms supplier for Taiwan because China has coerced every other country into not selling Taiwan any weapons.\u201d</p><p>Taiwan, a democratic and technologically vital island of 24 million people, faces increasing military, economic, and political pressure from Beijing. As China <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/articles/china-taiwan-weekly-update-july-3-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">accelerates</a> its gray zone and overt military activities around the island, from AI-generated deepfakes and disinformation targeting political candidates to drones breaching airspace and the use of fishing vessels operating under PLA guidance, Taiwan\u2019s defenses\u2014and America\u2019s credibility as a regional power\u2014are being tested.</p><p><strong>Xi\u2019s Calculus: When Will He Move?</strong></p><p>While Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly <a href=\"https://www.usip.org/publications/2025/02/xi-jinpings-calculus-cross-strait-conflict#:~:text=This%20article%20explores%20several%20specific,Taiwan%2C%20the%20likelihood%20of%20a\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">speaks</a> of \u201cpeaceful reunification,\u201d some analysts see his strategy shifting dramatically toward preparation for a potential war. In December, the People\u2019s Liberation Army launched its largest naval operation in the Taiwan Strait since 1996, simulating a blockade and attacks on foreign ships. Amphibious landing drills, maritime pressure campaigns, and cyber operations have intensified.</p><p>\u201cRelations are pretty bad, especially as China\u2019s economy struggles,\u201d Taiwanese legislator and Kuma Academy founder Puma Shen tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIf the economy falters, ideology becomes more important. Xi Jinping has chosen nationalism and the goal of \u2018Great China\u2019 as the main ideology, with taking back Taiwan as a key step.\u201d</p><p>In 2021, Admiral Phil Davidson, then Commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, <a href=\"https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/03/22/2003833850\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a> that China might seek to take Taiwan by 2027. Others predict a longer timeline, possibly into the 2030s. Yet most experts agree on one thing: an invasion is no longer a question of \u201cif\u201d but \u201cwhen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had to give a range, I\u2019d say possibly between 2032 and 2040,\u201d Alexander Huang, Special Advisor to the Chairman and Director of International Affairs for the opposition KMT, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThere\u2019s this unscientific estimate floating around that Xi might want to accomplish something \u2018big\u2019 before turning 80. That makes the next decade a period to observe.\u201d</p><p>Even if a full-scale invasion is delayed, Taiwan still faces near-term risks, including cyberattacks, blockades, disinformation, and surprise strikes.</p><p>\u201cA war with Taiwan would not be localized. Missiles would likely hit Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines,\u201d Scott Huang, a researcher at Taiwan\u2019s National Science and Technology Council, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThese countries would get involved. That\u2019s why China has been hesitant to initiate real war.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

As Liao points out, \u201cChina observes no rules and offers no restrictions in conducting influence and espionage operations against the Taiwanese public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are talking about everything from ostensibly religious organization exchanges, charity support, to funneling illegal campaign contributions, and utilizing local Mafia for blackmail and potential assassinations,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe CCP United Front and espionage effort has been able to increase existing societal contradictions, such as Taiwan\u2019s ever-difficult identity issues, driving wedges into political issues, and convincing the Taiwanese population that they cannot possibly fight the Chinese.\u201d</p><p>Beijing has been <a href=\"https://techinformed.com/china-readies-for-cyber-attack-against-taiwan/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">using</a> cyberwarfare and information operations against Taiwan\u2019s population ahead of any potential military action. With Taiwan\u2019s strategic location and its centrality in the global supply chain\u2014especially in semiconductors\u2014China understands that victory does not need to come solely through kinetic means.</p><p><strong>Semiconductors and Strategic Leverage</strong></p><p>For Washington, the stakes are immense. Taiwan\u2019s TSMC <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-makes-the-majority-of-the-worlds-computer-chips-now-its-running-out-of-electricity/#:~:text=Along%20the%20way%2C%20Hsinchu%20Science,world's%20most%20advanced%20computer%20chips.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">manufactures</a> approximately 90 percent of the world\u2019s advanced semiconductors, powering AI, military systems, and the global economy. Washington has been trying to change that.</p><p>TSMC\u2019s decision, made <a href=\"https://www.tsmc.com/static/abouttsmcaz/index.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than</a> five years ago, to build fabrication plants in the United States\u2014most notably a $40 billion investment in Arizona\u2014has been hailed as a move to bolster supply chain security and reduce dependence on East Asia. The project includes two advanced chip facilities in Phoenix, one of which is expected to manufacture cutting-edge 3-nanometer chips by 2026.</p><p>But Chen\u2019s comments reflect a deeper strategic reality: the most advanced nodes of chip manufacturing, engineering talent, and supply chain infrastructure remain deeply entrenched in Taiwan. The Arizona expansion may provide redundancy, but some experts believe it cannot fully replace the island\u2019s dominant role in global chip production. For Beijing, that leverage adds to the strategic calculus. For Washington, it highlights why Taiwan\u2019s security is inextricably linked to America\u2019s economic and national security interests.</p><p>\u201cSemiconductors are Taiwan\u2019s major strategic asset. But whether the recent investment in Arizona was TSMC\u2019s idea or happened under U.S. pressure is unclear,\u201d Liang-Chih Evans Chen, an associate research fellow at Taiwan\u2019s Institute for National Defense and Security Research, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt could be seen as Taiwan trying to spread its risk by diversifying manufacturing. That\u2019s a reasonable strategy, but it\u2019s not realistic to completely move TSMC out of Taiwan.\u201d</p><p>Beyond economics, the Taiwan Strait is also a maritime artery.</p><p>\u201cAbout 80 percent of ships in Asia pass through the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Shen notes. \u201cTaiwan also produces key technology components, like chips, that power global industries. A conflict would impact housing prices and economies worldwide.\u201d</p><p><strong>America\u2019s Unfinished Playbook</strong></p><p>Despite lacking formal diplomatic ties or a defense treaty with Taiwan, the U.S. remains the island\u2019s primary arms supplier and strategic partner. While President Trump\u2019s current remarks favor ambiguity\u2014he\u2019s declined to specify if he\u2019d defend Taiwan. His administration approved major arms sales to Taiwan and oversaw the highest-level U.S. visit in decades. The mixed signals complicate planning, but signal continuity in support.</p><p>Five months ago, the State Department quietly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/china-taiwan-us-state-department\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">removed</a> language that distanced the U.S. from supporting an independent Taiwan. In March, the G7 issued a firm rebuke of China\u2019s coercive tactics toward Taiwan, omitting the \u201cOne China\u201d language for the first time.</p><p>Vice President J.D. Vance has called China the \u201cbiggest threat\u201d to Washington. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth recently <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0uauGCYMRw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a> that \u201cthe threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent.\u201d</p><p>Still, ambiguity persists at the highest levels. Trump has declined to specify whether he would defend Taiwan, <a href=\"https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stating</a>, \u201cI don\u2019t want to ever put myself in that position.\u201d He has also said, \u201cTaiwan should pay us for defense.\u201d</p><p>Internal divisions and a slow-moving bureaucracy continue to be critical challenges.</p><p> \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a confirmed Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia. Same with the Pentagon\u2019s Indo-Pacific Security Affairs post. That leaves a massive vacuum in communication,\u201d stressed Alexander Huang. \u201cThere\u2019s no alliance treaty, no joint exercises, no shared doctrine, no direct communication network. How can they help? We don\u2019t even have interoperability \u2014 no Identification Friend or Foe system.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Leading security experts from the public and private sectors are gathering at The Cipher Brief Threat Conference October 19-22.

Yet delivery delays and domestic political gridlock complicate readiness.</p><p>\u201cDespite being eager to purchase more American arms, Taipei has struggled to receive its purchases in a timely fashion\u2014harming long-term readiness,\u201d Jack Burnham, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>.</p><p>A $6 billion defense budget cut by the KMT-majority legislature earlier this year further strained capabilities, experts lamented, <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202507010030#:~:text=The%20president%20then%20shifted%20focus,social%20media%20post%20Tuesday%20night.\" target=\"_blank\">prompting</a> pressure from President Lai for the frozen funds to be \u201cunfrozen\u201d in June. Still, the waiting game has many on edge.</p><p>\u201cThe first indigenous submarine was supposed to undergo trials this October, but it\u2019s already behind schedule,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWith budget cuts, we don\u2019t know what will happen with submarines two and three.\u201d</p><p>Experts also warn that most civilians remain unprepared for large-scale conflict.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re prepared in the same way we turn on Netflix every night and say, \u2018Oh, poor people in Ukraine or Gaza\u2014but not us!\u2019\u201d Alexander Huang points out. \u201cWe think we\u2019re the chosen ones, living on a beautiful island.\u201d</p><p>Should China act, Taiwan will require resupply from the U.S.\u2014missiles, fuel, medical kits, and more. Escorting convoys, running blockades, and challenging Chinese air superiority will almost certainly demand U.S. military intervention. Analysts underscore that the time for preparation is narrowing.</p><p>\u201cDuring an invasion scenario, Taiwan will eventually require resupply for everything from missiles to critical medical supplies,\u201d Liao surmises. \u201cEscorting such supply convoys and running a Chinese blockade would require U.S. intervention. There are very few scenarios where Taiwan can win alone.\u201d</p><p>But experts agree that if Taiwan falls, the global consequences will be felt far beyond the Taiwan Strait.</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

Inside the hotel ballroom where the governors had gathered, Michelle Lujan Grisham, the New Mexico governor, apologized for the noise but not the message. \u201cNew Mexicans are really loud,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>On the street, one sign read \u201cDefend Public Lands,\u201d with an image of an assault rifle. Others bore creative and bilingual profanities directed at Trump, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, who oversees most of the country\u2019s public acreage, and Sen. Mike Lee, the Republican from Utah, who on June 11 had proposed a large-scale selloff of public lands. Lee, who chairs the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, was not in Santa Fe, so the crowd focused on Burgum, who earlier that afternoon had addressed the governors about energy dominance and artificial intelligence. \u201cShow your face!\u201d the crowd chanted. But he had already departed the hotel through a back door. That night, a hunting group projected an image of him on the exterior wall of the hotel. \u201cBurgled by Burgum,\u201d it read.</p>\n\n<p>In the weeks before the meeting, the possibility of selling off large swaths of public lands had seemed as likely as at any time since the Reagan administration. On June 11, Lee had introduced an amendment to the megabill Congress was debating to reconcile the national budget. The amendment mandated the sale of up to 3 million acres of land controlled by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, with the vast majority of proceeds going to pay for tax cuts. Although Lee had framed his measure as a solution to the West\u2019s acute lack of affordable housing, it would have allowed developers to select the land they most desired. Under the amendment\u2019s original language, the ultimate power to nominate parcels for sale fell to Burgum and Brooke Rollins, head of the Department of Agriculture, which oversees the U.S. Forest Service.</p>\n\n<p>In the days after the Santa Fe protest, the outcry from hunting and outdoor recreation groups escalated across the West and the Senate parliamentarian ruled that Lee\u2019s amendment violated the chamber\u2019s rules. Republican lawmakers from Montana opposed the amendment; Burgum also distanced himself from it. (\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me at all if it\u2019s part of this bill,\u201d he told a reporter on June 26.)</p>\n\n<p>By the time Burgum made his comments, Lee\u2019s effort seemed doomed, and days later he announced that he was removing the amendment; public land advocates celebrated. \u201cThis win belongs to the hunters, anglers, and public landowners,\u201d wrote Patrick Berry, the president of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. But the celebration may have been premature. In a social media post announcing his decision, Lee indicated that he would revisit the issue: \u201cI continue to believe the federal government owns far too much land,\u201d he wrote. And powerful forces still support privatization. At the Santa Fe gathering, Rollins had been asked during a press conference about the effort to sell federal land. She told reporters she wasn\u2019t familiar with the specifics of Lee\u2019s amendment but supported his broader vision and suggested such efforts will continue regardless of the fate of the amendment. \u201cHalf of the land in the West is owned by the federal government,\u201d said Rollins. \u201cIs that really the right solution for the American people?\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Protestors gather outside the Eldorado Hotel &amp; Spa in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where the Western Governors\u2019 Association conference was held in June.\n    \n            (Dave Cox/Searchlight New Mexico)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n\n<p>The circumstances that led to Lee\u2019s proposal continue to simmer. The American West has an acute lack of affordable and attainable housing. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, Colorado, with a population of 6 million, is <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/gap/state/co\">lacking</a> 175,000 rental units for people who earn up to 50% of area median income. New Mexico, which has one-third of Colorado\u2019s population, is lacking 52,000 such rentals; Utah, 61,000. But nowhere is the issue as acute as in Nevada, where Las Vegas and Reno are encircled by public land. The state of 3.27 million is estimated to <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/gap/state/nv\">lack</a> 118,000 such rentals.</p>\n\n<p>The lack of housing emerged as a lever for Lee, who has sought to challenge federal control of public lands since he was first elected to the Senate in 2010. A year after winning his seat, he introduced a bill to sell a limited amount of public land, saying, \u201cThere is no critical need for the federal government to hold onto it.\u201d In 2013, he and others in his state\u2019s delegation wrote a letter demanding the transfer of federal lands to Utah and angrily accusing the Bureau of Land Management, which manages 245 million acres nationwide, of \u201cobvious abuse.\u201d And in a 2018 address at a think tank, he compared federal land managers \u2014 and people who recreate on public acreage \u2014 to feudal lords, ruling from far-off kingdoms on the coasts. He also denounced \u201celite publications\u201d that advocated for the protection of public lands, and he used the language of political war to describe the conflict over federal land: \u201cIt will take years, and the fight will be brutal.\u201d (Lee\u2019s office did not respond to detailed questions from ProPublica.)</p>\n\n<p>But this spring, Lee found support from unlikely places: the coastal elites he previously railed against seemed open to some of his ideas. The arguments in favor of privatization and development use a word of the season: abundance. Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson\u2019s bestselling book of the same name argues that burdensome regulatory processes have crushed the American housing market. While the authors focus on increasing supply in urban areas, in April, The New York Times ran an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/opinion/housing-crisis-federal-land.html\">op-ed</a> calling for building housing on public lands. That same week, the Times Magazine, in a piece titled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/magazine/suburban-sprawl-texas.html\">Why America Should Sprawl</a>,\u201d framed outward growth, including through the sale of public lands, as all but inevitable. The American Enterprise Institute, a free-market think tank, has estimated that the nation could build 3 million homes by opening federal land. In December, AEI leaders advocated for federal land sales in the <a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-homesteading-2-0-3233813/\">Las Vegas Review-Journal</a>, promising that disposal could \u201cusher in housing abundance and prosperity.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When pitching his land-sale bill, Lee adopted a more moderate tone than in years past, focusing squarely on housing. On June 20, he posted on X, \u201cThis is to help American families afford a home.\u201d On June 23: \u201cHousing prices are crushing families.\u201d The next day: \u201cThis land must go to American families.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>But it\u2019s challenging to build affordable housing on public land for a host of reasons, among them the high cost of infrastructure such as water pipelines and the cumbersome bureaucratic processes involving land agencies. But a primary obstacle is the price of that land itself: When it\u2019s sold at market rate, it\u2019s extremely difficult for developers to create affordable homes. \u201cHigh land costs alone can kill an otherwise great affordable housing project,\u201d said Waldon Swenson, vice president of corporate affairs for Nevada HAND, which builds affordable rental housing.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, past public land sales have created very little affordable housing. There\u2019s just one prominent test case, in Nevada, where a 1998 law enables the sale of federal land at market rate in the Las Vegas Valley and at steeply discounted prices throughout the state if it\u2019s to be used for affordable housing. Though municipalities can buy BLM land at $100 per acre to create affordable housing, the law has so far created just about 850 affordable units on 30 acres of land. By contrast, the law\u2019s market-value mechanism has enabled the sale of more than 17,000 acres of land at an average of more than $200,000 per acre. In March, the BLM <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/press-release/las-vegas-public-land-sale-nets-more-165-million-state-projects\">sold</a> 42 acres for $16.6 million. Meanwhile, according to a recent <a href=\"https://www.guinncenter.org/research/housing-affordability-in-nevada-an-economic-analysis-and-policy-considerations\">analysis</a>, rents in Clark and Washoe counties have respectively risen by 56% and 47% since 2018.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Lee\u2019s amendment did little to address these issues and lacked any definition of affordable or attainable housing. Furthermore, it allowed private developers to nominate parcels for sale \u2014 at market rate only. \u201cIt would be an unmitigated disaster,\u201d wrote Mark Squillace, a professor of natural resources law at the University of Colorado law school. John Leshy, a former solicitor for the Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration and an emeritus professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, said that the bill was \u201cnot a well-designed scheme to get more acres out there built with affordable houses.\u201d Leshy, the author of \u201cOur Common Ground: A History of America\u2019s Public Lands,\u201d added, \u201cI think it is just a ploy to get your toe in the door to start selling off lots of federal land.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            New houses were going up in Henderson, Nevada, in February. A 1998 law allows the sale of federal land at market rate in the Las Vegas Valley and at deep discounts throughout the state if it\u2019s to be used for affordable housing, which has led to the construction of some new units.\n    \n            (Sam Morris/Las Vegas Review-Journal/Tribune News Service/Getty Images)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n\n<p>Congress\u2019 stance toward public land shifted as settlers moved westward, violently displacing tribal nations. During the homesteading era, the General Land Office \u2014 a precursor to the BLM \u2014 was tasked with disposing of federal lands to states. But in the late 19th century, states began to request that Congress set aside lands for national forests. As a condition of its statehood, in 1896 Utah relinquished any claim to ownership of \u201cunappropriated public lands\u201d \u2014 an acknowledgment that appears in its state Constitution. As the conservation movement took off in the early 20th century, lawmakers and presidents set aside more public land. In 1976, Congress passed the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, which codified the BLM\u2019s role in stewarding lands and declared that they would remain public unless their sale served \u201cthe national interest.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Lee has lamented the impact of those historic changes on Utah, where 42% of the state is BLM land, saying in a 2018 speech, \u201cManifest destiny had left us behind, in some respects.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A movement in the 1970s tried to reverse those historical currents when Western ranchers and lawmakers calling themselves \u201cSagebrush Rebels\u201d sought to claim federal lands for states. They found sympathetic ears in Washington, D.C.: Ronald Reagan, during a 1980 campaign stop in Salt Lake City, said, \u201cCount me in as a rebel.\u201d Once elected, he nominated as secretary of the Interior James Watt, an attorney who favored transfer of public lands to the states. Reagan also came to rely on an economic adviser named Steve H. Hanke, who arrived at the White House from Johns Hopkins University. Hanke was more strident about getting rid of public lands than Watt; he has written that public lands \u201crepresent a huge socialist anomaly in America\u2019s capitalist system.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Hanke helped drive an ambitious effort to dispose of national forests and grazing lands, and in 1982 the Interior Department announced plans to sell millions of acres \u2014 as much as 5% of the public estate \u2014 in order to reduce the national debt. Hanke later joined The Heritage Foundation, entrenching the idea of privatizing lands at the conservative think tank and predicting that Americans would come around to his way of thinking. Since then, the foundation has regularly advocated for selling public lands. (The foundation did not respond to inquiries from ProPublica.)</p>\n\n<p>Lee is deeply tied into The Heritage Foundation, which he has called \u201ca guiding light for generations.\u201d In 2016, The Heritage Foundation suggested that Trump nominate Lee to the Supreme Court. Among Utah\u2019s leadership, his positions on federal land are widely held. Last year, the state attorney general filed suit to the United States Supreme Court, seeking to seize 18.5 million acres of federal public land. The court declined to hear the case.</p>\n\n<p>Public lands are popular, especially among hunters, hikers and off-roaders, and periodic efforts to sell them have incurred wrath. In 2017, Jason Chaffetz, the former Utah representative, retracted a disposal bill after a backlash. Last December, <a href=\"https://www.grandcanyontrust.org/blog/utah-voter-poll-2024-national-monuments-bears-ears-grand-staircase-escalante/\">a survey of 500 Utah voters</a> commissioned by the nonprofit Grand Canyon Trust found that a majority of both Democrats and Republicans supported preserving national monuments in the state. In its preelection policy recommendation known as Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation called for the privatization of everything from public education, using school-choice programs, to Medicare, by automatically enrolling patients in insurer-run plans. But it notably didn\u2019t call for the privatization of the public estate.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, Lee has recently focused the debate on affordable housing. In 2022 and 2023, Lee introduced legislation to sell Western lands called the HOUSES Act. The bill was more prescriptive than his reconciliation amendment: It only allowed states and municipalities to nominate lands for disposal, rather than developers, and it required that 85% of nominated parcels be developed as residential housing, at a minimum of four homes per acre, or as parks. But like his amendment to the reconciliation bill, Lee\u2019s HOUSES Act lacked a definition of affordable housing, and critics suggested that it would lead to the building of mansions. In both 2022 and 2023, when Lee reintroduced the bill, it did not pass out of committee.</p>\n\n<p>But it caught the attention of Kevin Corinth, then the staff director on the Joint Economic Committee, which advises Congress on financial matters. After leaving the Capitol, Corinth joined the American Enterprise Institute, which began focusing on building housing on federal lands. This March, AEI held an event with powerful developers to discuss its ideas, which it called \u201cHomesteading 2.0.\u201d Edward Pinto, a former Fannie Mae executive who helps oversee AEI\u2019s housing research, said during the event that the proposal \u201cgrew out of an effort that Sen. Lee undertook with the HOUSES Act.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>AEI advocates for dense development of single-family homes, but its ultimate vision remains opaque: The group has spoken of creating unregulated <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/startup-cities-donald-trump-legislation/\">\u201cfreedom cities\u201d</a> far from existing infrastructure, and its proposals for 3 million houses seem ambitious. Headwaters Economics, a nonprofit group in Montana, published an <a href=\"https://headwaterseconomics.org/public-lands/wildfire-public-land-housing/\">analysis</a> finding that existing public land could support less than 700,000 new homes; Nicholas Irwin, the research director for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas\u2019 Lied Center for Real Estate, said he found Headwaters\u2019 numbers more convincing.</p>\n\n<p>When I asked Pinto for a real-world example that illustrates his hopes for the West, he pointed to Summerlin, a planned community in Las Vegas, and Teravalis, a forthcoming development in Buckeye, Arizona, a rapidly expanding city at Phoenix\u2019s edge. Both are owned by Howard Hughes Holdings, a developer based in Texas.</p>\n\n<p>Housing in Summerlin is not easily attainable \u2014 its median home price approaches $700,000. Teravalis, meanwhile, was first proposed more than 20 years ago and has been beset by delays, in part due to ongoing litigation with the state, which claims that the developer has not proven that it can obtain a sufficient water supply. A spokesperson for Howard Hughes Holdings, which bought the development in 2021, wrote that the company is \u201cworking with local stakeholders around long-term water policy to support the full build out of Teravalis for more than 300,000 residents over several decades.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, Pershing Square Holdings, which is controlled by the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, purchased $900 million of stock in the company. (Ackman, a prominent supporter of Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, is now the executive chairman of Hughes\u2019 board of directors. Through a spokesperson, he declined to comment for this article.)</p>\n\n<p>Teravalis\u2019 first lots sold for a steep $777,000 per acre without homes on them, and Hughes\u2019 plans are for 2.8 dwellings per acre \u2014 less than a quarter of the figure that Pinto cited as ideal for naturally affordable housing. Hughes is currently planning a grand opening for November. The company did not say how much homes would cost, but a spokesperson wrote in a statement, \u201cThe need for new housing in the Phoenix West Valley is urgent, and Teravalis will help meet that demand.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute cited Teravalis, a planned community in Buckeye, Arizona, as the kind of development that could be built with sales of more public lands.\n    \n            (Adriana Zehbrauskas/The Washington Post/Getty Images)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>When given the option, developers often pursue the profit margins of high-end housing. In 1998, Congress passed a law, the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act, that allows any of the state\u2019s municipalities to request the sale of federal lands for affordable housing. (SNPLMA relies on the Department of Housing and Urban Development to define affordable housing, which it says are units within reach of those making up to 80% of the area\u2019s median income.) Still, to date, only about 900 acres have been set aside for affordable housing projects under the law \u2014 and only 30 of those acres have been developed into homes where low-income residents can actually live.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s unclear why so few affordable housing projects have been built at a time when they are so desperately needed. Clark County Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick attributed it to bureaucratic delays: \u201cIt\u2019s taken a long time to get through the process with the BLM.\u201d According to Maurice Page, executive director of the Nevada Housing Coalition, the average time the BLM takes to review projects has recently dropped \u2014 from between three and five years to one. Only at that point can a developer close a deal. Tina Frias, CEO of the Southern Nevada Home Builders Association, said such delays can be crippling.</p>\n\n<p>In 2023, the BLM began selling Nevada land for affordable housing for $100 per acre. (Previous SNPLMA affordable housing sales had averaged nearly $35,000 per acre.) Still, local authorities have not requested the transfer of many parcels in recent years. According to the BLM, only three new affordable housing projects are moving toward approval.</p>\n\n<p>In a statement, a spokesperson for the agency wrote, \u201cBLM Nevada can only offer land after it has been nominated by an eligible entity and BLM has confirmed that there are no encumbrances or restrictions on the parcel. In many cases, the restrictions referenced by stakeholders originate with the nominating entities themselves.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>SNPLMA\u2019s affordable housing mechanism is also poorly understood. Alexis Hill, the chair of Washoe County\u2019s board of commissioners, which includes Reno, told me she didn\u2019t know whether the affordable housing provision applied there. (It does.) When I asked Biden\u2019s former BLM director, Tracy Stone-Manning, who now leads The Wilderness Society, whether the $100-per-acre provision was applicable statewide, she said she did not know. Squillace, the Colorado law professor, also admitted he wasn\u2019t sure how widely the provision applied.</p>\n\n<p>Steve Aichroth, the administrator of the Nevada Housing Division, acknowledged a disconnect between agencies. His office is hiring an official to work with municipalities and the BLM. \u201cIf you came back to us in about a year we\u2019d have better answers,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, both of the state\u2019s Democratic senators, Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto, have proposed legislation that would open federal acreage for housing and transfer it to trust land for tribal nations \u2014 while protecting other territory for conservation. The governor, Joe Lombardo, a Republican, recently signed a bill to invest $183 million of state money in developing housing for lower- and middle-class residents. Elsewhere in the West, New Mexico is leasing state lands to develop apartments. In Utah, the state housing office is encouraging cities to change zoning requirements to increase density; it is also using public funds to finance private developments and looking to build on state lands. Before Lee pulled his amendment, I spoke with Steve Waldrip, who directs housing strategy for Utah Gov. Spencer Cox. During our conversation, Waldrip expressed concern that the hyperpoliticized debate around a broad federal land sell-off was hampering focused efforts to alleviate the region\u2019s housing crisis. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet that\u2019s going to solve the affordability crisis,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>But some continue to believe a simple solution exists. After Lee\u2019s amendment died, I spoke with Pinto, who directs AEI\u2019s efforts to push for housing on federal lands. He struck a conciliatory tone, given the political climate. (The sweeping GOP bill passed Thursday without Lee\u2019s amendment.) At the moment, Pinto said, there doesn\u2019t appear to be an easy route to sell large swaths of public land for development. \u201cThe path forward is to have a much more targeted approach.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In Nevada, such a thing is already happening. Last year Clark County bought 20 acres from the BLM for $2,000, and the county\u2019s plan is to turn that land into single-family houses for first-time homebuyers. This spring, a new affordable housing development opened in Las Vegas \u2014 an apartment complex for people 55 and older with rent starting at $573. The project was built by a developer called Ovation on former public land that was transferred through SNPLMA. It had taken a while \u2014 the deal was first proposed in February 2020. But recently, the pace of transfers has picked up. Ovation says it\u2019s also working on a similar project in the city of Henderson. It was nominated for BLM approval last February and, according to Jess Molasky, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, \u201cWe hope to be in the ground in the first quarter of next year.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/gabriel-sandoval\">Gabriel Sandoval</a> contributed research.</p>",

The new Trump team should extend this standard-setting practice, partnering with the insurance industry to establish high standards for America\u2019s private critical infrastructure operators.</p><p>The insurance industry would leverage its experience with cyber incident data from hundreds of thousands of cyber incidents to help government set these minimum standards across sectors and functions within sectors. </p><p>The government would require operators to establish Cybersecurity Information Centers (CICs) to audit organizational standards compliance, report their results to the government, and inform the management of their internal cyber security posture.</p><p>In much the same way that U.S. public companies are required to report financial results following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the CIC reporting standard would provide the government and insurers important visibility into operator risk and provide operators a standardized framework for cyber risk management. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Join us in Sea Island, Georgia for The Cipher Brief's </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>2025 Threat Conference</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> from October 19-22.

The water utility\u2019s CIC would continuously monitor its cyber risks against the sector\u2019s ground truth. The water operator, the government, and insurance companies would be informed of whether the utility complies and how well it performs compared to other operators. </p><p>Through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), industry regulators, and potential reinsurance vehicles, the government would work with the insurance industry to mandate compliance or the water utility would be denied cyber insurance coverage. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Sign up for the </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Cyber Initiatives Group</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

The federal government would use CIC insights to invest intelligently in cyber grants for cash-poor state and local entities such as water utilities. Through these smart grants, the government would assume the role of \u201ccyber insurer of last resort\u201d, shifting the risk of catastrophic cyber-attacks from the weakest and most vulnerable operators to the federal government. </p><p>The CIC insights would also inform and bolster CISA\u2019s JCDC efforts to protect vulnerable operators and, where necessary, engage the unique capabilities of the <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/About/Cybersecurity-Collaboration-Center/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>National Security Agency\u2019s Cybersecurity Collaboration Center (CCC)</u></a>.</p><p>Finally, the administration could unleash a private sector boom in cybersecurity and risk management innovation by enabling technology solution providers to conduct the CIC standards audits. Beyond creating a market for audits, the government could share anonymized versions of the overall pool of CIC data to enable private sector partners to develop and train better cyber solutions. </p><p><strong>America\u2019s Common Defense, Built on Public-Private Collaboration</strong></p><p>Vulnerable populations in medieval times responded to existential threats by collaborating for a \u201ccommon defense\u201d through the construction of walls around their villages. From our nation\u2019s very beginning it was the federal government that maintained a \u201ccommon defense\u201d for our citizens, consistently relying upon, amongst other things, two great oceans, and mostly friendly neighbors to the north and south to serve as 20th century defensive walls to protect us. </p><p>In 2025, the new Trump Administration has a unique opportunity to build a new public-private collaboration framework that builds cyber \u201cwalls\u201d to fill remaining digital gaps and effectively provides for our national \u201ccommon cyber defense\u201d.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT Q&amp;A \u2014 </strong><em><em>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in Washington D.C. on Monday to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House \u2014 their third meeting this year. Netanyahu\u2019s visit follows the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran last month. Two items are at the top of Trump\u2019s agenda for the meeting: a ceasefire deal on Gaza, and a nuclear deal with Iran.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Before Netanyahu touched down in the U.S., The Cipher Brief spoke with Ambassador Gary Grappo, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Oman and Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, to discuss the dynamics and outcomes he is on the lookout for at the Trump-Netanyahu meeting. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. You can watch the full discussion on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaxOCtsvOjE\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief YouTube Channel</a>.</em></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>What are you going to be looking for as this meeting unfolds?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>The last time the president and Mr. Netanyahu met, it was very much a Trump-dominated visit. They had a public event in which Mr. Netanyahu shockingly spoke very, very little and even seemed a bit submissive. I'll be interested to see how that dynamic plays out in this visit. I expect it to be very, very different. And secondly, looking at the actual specifics, what comes out of this, what they discuss, what are the issues that they focus on and address, the circumstances of this visit, of course, are very, different from Mr. Netanyahu's previous visits to the White House since Trump took office. </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>We know President Trump is very much interested in a deal on the war in Gaza, and also vis-a-vis Iran. It does seem that Prime Minister Netanyahu may be a little less eager. Let's talk about Gaza first. The U.S. hasn't had much success in this administration or the Biden administration before it in pressuring or using its leverage against Israel to get any changes in terms of the prosecution of that war. Do you think it's a different circumstance now?</p><p> <em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>It is a different circumstance. Certainly the dynamic in Gaza has changed very, very little since the last time they met. The Israelis unquestionably hold the upper hand. They literally control between 60-70 percent of the territory of Gaza. They're continuing their efforts to root out Hamas throughout the territory, as challenging as that is now since they're more dispersed, deeply hidden and it's requiring that the IDF to employ different tactics than they may have earlier on in the war.</p><p>But what has really changed is Iran and what has taken place in Iran over the course of the last month to six weeks, with Iran now greatly weakened. Its threat in terms of its nuclear weapons is much diminished thanks primarily to the efforts of the Israelis, but also to the United States and specifically the decision of Donald Trump to enter the war as he did with the dropping of those bunker buster bombs. So there'll be a bit of a good feeling coming out of that, and deservedly so for both sides. And that is going to factor in, I think, into the conversation they have about Gaza.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>Is it essentially that Trump may feel the U.S. did what Israel had been asking us to do for some time with those bunker busters against Iran, and now we'd like Israel to come to the table and push the Gaza deal over the line, assuming, of course, that Hamas is OK with some of those final provisions? Is that the game here?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>That\u2019s certainly one factor here. Donald Trump did jump into a fray that he initially was very reluctant to join \u2014 he had said so publicly before Israel started its first series of attacks on Iran earlier in June. There\u2019ll be something of that in Donald Trump's conversation with Bibi, but also the fact that now with the great danger tamed in Iran, Bibi has much more room for maneuver, including from right-wing members who have threatened to leave his coalition unless he followed a pretty hard-line approach to Gaza, but also Iran. They may be less of a threat now, given the fact that the threat from Iran has diminished.</p><p>And there's a third factor here, and Donald Trump has hinted to this in the last week to 10 days, and that is the charges hanging over Bibi Netanyahu's head. Donald Trump has intimated making a statement that these charges should be dismissed. Mr. Trump is very, very popular in Israel, and if he's making statements like this, which is inserting himself into the judicial process in Israel in a very direct way, it can have a very telling effect on Netanyahu's right wing \u2014 even if they threaten to leave, Mr. Netanyahu may stand a better chance in any elections which might result from the collapse of his coalition.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Apply for a seat at the table today.</em></strong></em></u></a></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>Let's go to Iran. Donald Trump would love what he would consider a good deal with Iran. Netanyahu and that right flank, not so much.</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>No, not at all. Trump very, very much fears getting drawn into another Middle East war and to allow the Israelis to press the advantage, which they may very well do even without the United States. There\u2019s the fear that once again, the Americans may be drawn into the conflict, particularly given the likelihood that the Iranians are going to move to expedite the development of their weapons program, whatever its current state may be. And there seems to still be some question about how much of the more highly enriched uranium they have, how many centrifuges they may still have and where they are located, which could require another American intervention. And I think Trump is fearful of that.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>The question of the Trump administration's leverage is interesting. I was struck by the fact that during that period when a ceasefire was first agreed to, to end this recent 12-day campaign in Iran, there was a moment when President Trump took to social media to say to the Israelis, stop those bombers. It does seem like at least for the short term, he'd like the Israelis to lay low, right?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>Absolutely. Don't forget Mr. Trump has his right wing to answer to as well. It was known from the outset that some of his more hardline supporters were very much opposed to the American intervention in Iran and still are despite the obvious success of the American involvement. They really would like to see us close the book on our intervention there because they also see a real danger of the Americans being further entrapped, they would say, in another Middle East war if the Israelis decide, as you say, to press the advantage.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>We spoke soon after President Trump had announced his arrangement under which the U.S. would take control in Gaza. Whatever happened to that?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>It has been forgotten, but I think it's been put on the shelf, which in fact has become a library of plans for settling the Israeli-Palestinian dispute that never get implemented. I just don't see it as a possibility. What we're currently discussing is a ceasefire, and there are some signs that Hamas may be taking it a little more seriously than they have previously. The Israelis have indicated their willingness to accept it, although I'm sure there are some caveats. But what the administration would like to see is the ceasefire go into effect with assurances provided by the United States that negotiations for a permanent end to the conflict would continue during this 60-day period. And I'm not sure the Israelis are prepared to agree to that. I'll have to see. I'm sure that'll be a discussion point when they meet.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

They do not want to see a continuation of an active conflict in Iran. So they will be hoping that the president can keep the lid on that.</p><p>And then secondly, for Mr. Trump, [the normalization of Israeli-Saudi ties] still remains his ace in the hole. This is something that Bibi Netanyahu very, very much wants to have \u2014 it would be a signature achievement, but that's going to require an acceptable solution to the war in Gaza. And so that's an ace in the hole for Trump if he decides to play it, if he has spoken at all with the Saudis about this possibility. They have previously indicated their hesitancy to enter into any normalization talks without a clear path toward a Palestinian state. They might be willing to accept some general verbiage around that point without necessarily committing to a Palestinian state in terms of a time frame. But they very much want to see an end to this war and a change in the predicament of the Palestinian people of Gaza who still remain suffering, huddled up in a very, very small area with food shortages, even famine and starvation in some areas. A massive humanitarian effort is going to be necessary.</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> on YouTube?

Last month, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/fda-tacrolimus-kidney-transplant-patient\">ProPublica reported</a> that a generic immunosuppression drug for transplant patients could dissolve too quickly when ingested, increasing the risk of kidney failure. The drug was made at an Indian factory with a history of quality violations that was banned from the U.S. market. The company previously told ProPublica it believes the medication is safe.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In April, more than <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge-fact-sheet.html\">3,500</a> FDA employees were laid off under U.S. Department and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a roughly 15% reduction in force. \u201cWe aren\u2019t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge.html\">Kennedy said</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, the agency said the reductions would not impact inspectors. Kennedy has since announced that HHS would reverse 20% of the cuts across the agency. Amid <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-to-reverse-some-layoffs-food-drug-safety/\">news reports</a> describing the layoffs at the FDA, Kennedy did not specify how many people would be reinstated.</p>\n\n<p>ProPublica spoke to 10 current and former FDA staff members and leaders in recent weeks, including inspectors who said that the loss of support staff has slowed critical investigations and that little relief has materialized. Most declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly or feared backlash within the industry as they search for new jobs.</p>\n\n<p>One veteran drug inspector said nearly 70 people who helped arrange travel, budgets, translators and contingency plans for investigations were laid off. Only about one-third have been brought back, forcing a handful of busy managers to coordinate travel clearances and visas for inspections that can span weeks and include stops in multiple countries.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get inspections done,\u201d the investigator said. \u201cThe pace has slowed down. You can\u2019t inspect as many sites.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In an email, an HHS spokesperson said inspections have not been affected by downsizing. The agency did not address questions about how many people have been let go or reinstated or whether additional help will be brought on.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo be clear, FDA inspectors were not impacted, and this critical work continues,\u201d the agency said.</p>\n\n<p>Two former FDA commissioners and the agency\u2019s longtime head of drug safety, however, said that the loss of support staff has undermined one of the FDA\u2019s most essential missions at a time when Americans get most of their generic drugs from overseas manufacturers. That includes chemotherapy treatments, sedatives, antibiotics and medications on hospital crash carts.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like saying, \u2018Oh we didn\u2019t fire any of the doctors or nurses at the hospital, but we fired all the lab techs, all the orderlies, all the phlebotomists \u2026 oh, but the doctors and nurses are still left so it\u2019s fine,\u2019\u201d said Janet Woodcock, who ran the agency\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research for more than two decades and retired in 2024. \u201cA lot of the connective tissue that deals with drug safety and similar things are going to be missing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the staff cuts, the departures of some longtime investigators and leaders in recent months have left less experienced people tasked with rooting out dangerous and sometimes deceptive manufacturing practices.</p>\n\n<p>The investigative unit, which looks into potential safety issues with drugs, vaccines, medical devices and other products, has had a retention problem for years. Inspectors leave so often that even with hiring blitzes, the FDA has been unable to get ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Between 2022 and 2024, the agency hired 105 inspectors but about the same number left, leaving the inspection pool with about 230 people, according to <a href=\"https://files.gao.gov/reports/GAO-25-106775/index.html\">the Government Accountability Office</a>, the watchdog arm of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>About one-third did not have the experience to conduct independent foreign inspections, the GAO found.</p>\n\n<p>Two FDA inspectors said the agency needs an additional 100 to 200 experienced investigators to do the work.</p>\n\n<p>The job can be grueling. Some inspectors who travel to overseas drug-making factories can be away for as long as 15 weeks a year. Some have described threats of violence by company managers, days on planes and trains in oppressive heat and long nights preparing inspection reports before they head to the next stop.</p>\n\n<p>The loss of experienced investigators and cuts to support staff have also hamstrung other inspectors.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am in utter shock that they don\u2019t support and promote those of us who can do a decent inspection,\u201d said one investigator who scrutinizes factories that produce vaccines, cell therapies and other biological products. \u201cYou\u2019re adding to the chaos.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>Dozens of employees who handled technology support, facilities, supplies and equipment were dismissed as well, snarling some day-to-day operations at the agency. One current employee recalled how a colleague couldn\u2019t find replacement batteries for a computer mouse and how another locked herself out of her office and couldn\u2019t get back in because there was no one to open the door.</p>\n\n<p>Even before the layoffs, the FDA\u2019s investigative force <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-106775\">struggled to monitor</a> drug-making factories in countries that include India and China, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising alarms in Congress that serious manufacturing lapses may have gone unchecked. The FDA received more than 1 million reports from doctors, patients and others in 2023 about product quality issues or consumers who had adverse reactions to drugs, FDA data shows.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThings will be missed,\u201d former FDA inspector Patrick Stone said about the layoffs. \u201cWe are going to have a lot less safe drugs.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration has said little about the layoffs in recent weeks, though <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-health-secretary-kennedy-says-he-brought-back-722-cdc-employees-220-nih-2025-06-24/\">Kennedy told Congress</a> late last month that more than 900 employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health had been reinstated.</p>\n\n<p>The FDA <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-announces-expanded-use-unannounced-inspections-foreign-manufacturing-facilities\">announced in May</a> that it would expand the use of unannounced inspections at overseas factories, a move that some members of Congress have been <a href=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/grassley-at-hearing-on-foreign-drug-manufacturing-inspection-oversight\">pushing</a> for years. And FDA Commissioner Marty Makary <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-launches-agency-wide-ai-tool-optimize-performance-american-people\">announced</a> that a new AI tool known as Elsa would help identify inspection targets.</p>\n\n<p>Current and former employees others say that won\u2019t make up for the losses.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just expect the inspector to take care of all the complexities of organizing their trips overseas,\u201d said former FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, who served under the Obama administration. \u201cEven though it might be said we\u2019ve kept the inspectors, that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ve kept the infrastructure \u2026 that actually supports safe and meaningful inspections.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/brandon-roberts\">Brandon Roberts</a> contributed data analysis.</p>\n\n        \n\n    \n          \n                \n            Correction\n            <p><strong>July 8, 2025:</strong> This story originally misstated the year that Janet Woodcock retired from the Food and Drug Administration.

Netanyahu continues to push a no-holds-barred war in Gaza and an uncompromising position on Iran and its nuclear program; Donald Trump is looking to make deals on both fronts.</p><p>Publicly, Trump and Netanyahu will no doubt cheer the success of recent strikes against Iran and the coordination that was evident between the two nations during that 12-day war. In the wake of those attacks, Trump offered to negotiate with Iran, and he has repeatedly urged Israel and Hamas to accept what he calls a \u201cfinal proposal\u201d for a Gaza truce. </p><p>These are the latest in a series of efforts the President has made to make peace on the global stage. As a candidate, Trump promised quick solutions to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and since his second inaugural, he has expended significant diplomatic efforts on Iran and global trade disputes as well. And other than a few trade agreements, he has made no major deals as yet. Might the Netanyahu visit change that? </p><p>Experts say the hurdles involve domestic pressures on the Israeli Prime Minister, who has shown little interest in deals that don\u2019t suit the right-wing nationalists in his government.</p><p>\u201cFor Netanyahu, there are domestic political concerns that are influencing his enthusiasm about proceeding with a ceasefire [in Gaza] or formal negotiations with Iran,\u201d Jason Campbell, Senior Fellow at The Middle East Institute, told The Cipher Brief. \u201cI think that will continue to be a flashpoint in his discussions with President Trump.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Ambassador Gary Grappo, whose diplomatic career included high-level postings in Oman, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, said that Trump\u2019s decision to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2013 something Netanyahu clearly wanted the U.S. to do \u2013 may help him press the Israeli leader to halt his campaign in Gaza.</p><p>\u201cDonald Trump jumped into a fray that initially he was very reluctant to join, and had said so publicly before Israel started its first series of attacks on Iran,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. He expects Trump to use that \u201cbig favor to Israel,\u201d as he called it, in his discussions with Netanyahu. </p><p><strong>A rare rift</strong></p><p>Although President Trump has boasted frequently of his close relationship to Israel \u2013 the country \u201chas never had a better friend in the White House,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/8/trump-tells-jewish-americans-he-is-israels-best-friend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a> during his first term. But he has stymied Netanyahu several times since his return to office. </p><p>The last time the Israeli Prime Minister came to the White House, Trump refused to give him a green light for attacking Iran, and just days before Israel\u2019s strikes last month, he <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/trump-told-netanyahu-not-strike-iran-nuclear\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said publicly</a> that such attacks would be \u201cinappropriate.\u201d </p><p>Earlier this year, Netanyahu <a href=\"https://jweekly.com/2025/05/07/us-announces-truce-with-houthis-without-telling-israel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">was reportedly furious</a> to learn that the Trump administration had negotiated directly with Hamas to free U.S. hostages, and that the White House had ended its campaign against Houthi militants without informing Israel. It didn\u2019t help matters that when Trump took his four-day visit to the Middle East in May, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mideast-trump-israel-diplomacy-saudi-syria-gaza-5d20c749f79b3e5c7b78def1d6588334\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he chose</a> to leave Israel off the itinerary.</p><p>After that trip, former White House Middle East adviser Dennis Ross<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/trumps-gulf-tour-the-money-deals-the-diplomacy-and-what-comes-next\" target=\"_self\"> told The Cipher Brief</a> that \u201cthe Israelis are learning that President Trump is going to do what he decides is in our interests \u2013 we've seen a pattern recently of, \u2018We'll do what we want, and it doesn't necessarily mean we feel their interests have to be taken into account.\u2019\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a rupture of the relationship, Ross said, but it was highly unusual for a self-proclaimed \u201cbest friend\u201d of Israel. </p><p>The June 22 U.S. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts-assess-strikes-response-and-what-comes-next\" target=\"_self\">bunker-buster strikes</a> \u2013 which some referred to as a \u201cfavor\u201d to Israel \u2013 appear to have swung the U.S.-Israel pendulum back in a more favorable direction. <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-thanks-trump-for-support-tells-iranians-your-liberation-from-tyranny-is-closer-than-ever/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netanyahu said</a> as much last week, thanking Trump for his \u201csteadfast stance\u201d on Iran and his overall support of Israel. \u201cI thank him for his consistent support of our country,\u201d he said.</p><p><strong>Deal or no deal, part one: The Gaza war</strong></p><p>Since the strikes against Iran, Trump has been pressing Netanyahu hard \u2013 demanding almost, that he finalize a proposed 60-day ceasefire deal with Hamas. </p><p>This week, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-07-02-2025-111a1cf968318cb0fb6d9865a3ac84dc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump wrote</a> on social media that Israel had \u201cagreed to the necessary conditions to finalize\u201d the ceasefire, \u201cduring which time we will work with all parties to end the War.\u201d The<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-negotiations.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> outlines of the deal</a> include the release of the hostages \u2013 there are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-hostages-released-76f4aef0816546f5048ca881bcd32e4b\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">about 50</a> remaining in Gaza, and authorities believe fewer than half of them are still be alive.

Israel would pull back troops from Gaza, and negotiations would continue over those 60 days to bring about the end of the war.</p><p>Hamas says it is weighing the proposal. Its prime demand is for assurances that the process produces an end to the war \u2013 but Israel hasn\u2019t agreed to the plan either. Netanyahu has yet to commit to a final resolution to the war, only a temporary ceasefire, and he and his government are insisting on a complete dismantling of Hamas \u2013 both its military wing and government.</p><p>\u201cThere will be no Hamas,\u201d Netanyahu said recently. \u201cWe will free our hostages, and we will defeat Hamas.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Sign up for the <a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cyber Initiatives Group</a> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

Grappo said, \u201cand specifically the decision of Donald Trump to enter the war as he did with the dropping of those bunker-buster bombs. And that is going to factor into the conversation they have about Gaza.\u201d</p><p>The families of the Israeli hostages appear to understand the Iran connection. Several family members set up tables on Friday outside the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, calling for \"One Big Beautiful Hostage Deal.\"</p><p>Former hostage Keith Siegel, an Israeli-American who was freed earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-04/ty-article/.premium/one-big-beautiful-hostage-deal-hostage-families-protest-outside-u-s-embassy-branch/00000197-d4d3-d78d-a39f-ddd7dcf00000\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told the gathering</a>, \"The leader who achieved a cease-fire with Iran can also deliver the deal of all deals in Gaza,\" adding, \"This is our moment, the families are waiting. The 50 hostages are waiting.\"</p><p><strong>Deal or no deal, part two: What's next for Iran?</strong></p><p>Trump and Netanyahu will no doubt compare notes on the damage done by their strikes on the three Iranian nuclear sites. Trump\u2019s insistence that the Iranian nuclear program was \u201cobliterated\u201d is not a view shared by the intelligence services of either country \u2013 and the Israelis in particular see the Iran issue as unfinished business. </p><p>\u201cItem one on the agenda will be collaborating on the current status of the Iranian regime and its nuclear capabilities, and from that to assess how best to approach this in the near to medium term,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWhat are the near and medium-term objectives? Can we come to some sort of an understanding or agreement there on how to pursue them?\u201d</p><p>Campbell believes Trump will seek \u201csome path to negotiation\u201d on Iran, but he added that \u201cit will remain to be seen the degree to which Netanyahu and Israel agree on the steps to be taken.\u201d</p><p>While Trump sees the attacks on Iran as a potential opening for a deal \u2013 with the big \u201cif\u201d involving how Iran responds \u2013 Netanyahu and his right-wing cabinet members see a chance to stop Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and missile programs once and for all. In this view, it\u2019s a time to deliver knockout blows, not a moment for diplomacy. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\">Sign up today</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>For this reason, Cohen says, Netanyahu wants U.S. backing for possible additional strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. </p><p>\u201cWe've bought time [with the damage done to Iran\u2019s nuclear program], and from the Israeli perspective, they want to make sure that that time actually extends out as long as possible,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cMy guess is Netanyahu is also going to be pushing to maintain the sanctions on Iran, and Trump has sort of shown a little bit of softness or openness to relaxing some of those. I don't think that's what Netanyahu would want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is some distance between the positions of Mr. Trump and the Israeli government, including Mr. Netanyahu, on Iran,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cAnd don't forget Mr. Trump has his right wing to answer to as well. It was known from the outset that some of his more hardline supporters were very much opposed to the American intervention in Iran and still are\u2026They also see a real danger of the Americans being further entrapped in another Middle East war if the Israelis decide to press the advantage.\u201d</p><p><strong>The Saudi factor \u2013 and the Gaza \u201cRiviera\u201d</strong></p><p>Beyond Gaza and Iran, President Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d Middle East deal involves another major power in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia. Trump\u2019s singular foreign policy achievement during his first term was the so-called Abraham Accords, which produced peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. And he has made clear his wish to bring Saudi Arabia into those agreements.</p><p>The Biden administration was pursuing a Saudi-Israeli rapprochement as well, but all progress on that front ended abruptly with the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and the war on Gaza that followed. Saudi Arabia has insisted on a peace deal in Gaza and a plan for a Palestinian state as prerequisites for entering into any deal with the Israelis. Trump would love to be seen as the architect of this new and potentially critical piece of the Abraham Accords, and certainly the Israelis would love to see it happen. </p><p>\u201cFor Mr. Trump, this still remains his ace in the hole,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cIt's something that Bibi Netanyahu very, very much wants to have. It would be a signature achievement to have normalization of Israeli-Saudi ties, but that's going to require an acceptable solution to the war in Gaza. And so that's an ace in the hole for Trump if he decides to play it.\u201d</p><p>One thing is clear, as Netanyahu heads for Washington: Trump\u2019s last big plan for Gaza \u2013 the idea that the U.S. would take over the territory and create a real-estate bonanza on the \u201cRiviera\u201d \u2013 is no longer in the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI think it's been forgotten,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cOr at least it's been put on the shelf, and that shelf has over the years, become a library of plans for settling the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>It pays to be a Subscriber+Member.

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION --</strong> The United States is facing a quiet and rapidly growing threat across the digital landscape, an unseen mathematical space of binary code and shadowy actors. This landscape demands more, not less, attention, and urgently, if the U.S. is to win the strategic competition of this generation.</p><p>The most sophisticated and ambitious of our adversaries is the government of the People's Republic of China in Beijing, which is pursuing an aggressive national strategy to undermine America's digital future.</p><p>More than 20 years have passed since the last major reorganization of the U.S. intelligence community. In that time, the adversarial threat landscape has changed dramatically, and technology has become central to the intelligence mission. With ever-increasing demands being placed on the Intelligence Community (IC) in a time of fiscal constraint, it is right to ask whether it is optimized for the emerging threats of tomorrow. It is not.</p><p>Given these stakes, lawmakers and national security leaders debating the most significant reforms since 2004 face a critical choice: focus on the real challenges posed by China's digital strategy or become mired in bureaucratic reshuffling.</p><p>The current debate in Washington, focused on the Intelligence Community Efficiency and Effectiveness Act of 2025, exemplifies this risk. It proposes substantial cuts and a restructuring of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which has indeed grown beyond its envisioned size and narrow mission. While ODNI's future size and structure merit discussion, that topic should not distract policymakers with arguments over bureaucratic power, resources, and prestige while missing the bigger, more urgent picture.</p><p>The true measure of reform should not be judged by organizational charts, which rarely impact mission success. The core issues are aligning skills and resources with our most pressing challenges, eliminating bureaucracy that fails to contribute meaningfully to the mission, and unleashing American innovation. Importantly, it is also the candid acknowledgment that espionage demands audacity, agility and risk in the field and in the technical ops center, the so-called pointy end of the spear. Yet institutional incentives often discourage the calculated risks essential to effective intelligence work, creating structural barriers to the bold action required in today's digital intelligence mission.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

Beijing views AI as critical infrastructure for national security and geopolitical influence, backing it with extensive state investment and a military-civil fusion program to weaponize civilian technology. To effectively counter this, the U.S. IC must achieve and maintain dominance in all digital domains where China's advancements are most pronounced.</p><p>Cyber Collection and Defense: China increasingly leverages AI-driven automation to conduct sophisticated cyber espionage, systematically compromising critical U.S. infrastructure, intellectual property, and defense-related information. Yet our current cyber capabilities are hampered by antiquated acquisition processes that treat software like hardware, sometimes taking years to field capabilities that adversaries deploy on rapid timelines.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence: Beijing uses powerful AI algorithms to analyze vast datasets, including the personal and biometric data of Americans, to significantly enhance the precision and scale of its espionage. Meanwhile, IC agencies struggle with bureaucratic barriers that prevent rapid adoption of commercial AI tools and make it difficult to partner with smaller tech companies who are leading innovation in this space.</p><p>Strategic Data Acquisition: China's comprehensive data strategy treats information as a strategic asset, harvesting it from commercial, governmental, and individual sources to fuel its AI systems. Naturally, the IC\u2019s ability to leverage open-source data is limited by its available budget, but this is an area worthy of modest additional investment to benefit the mission of all IC members.</p><p>Information Operations: Chinese state actors utilize generative AI tools, including advanced deepfakes and social media manipulation, to propagate disinformation, deepen societal divisions, and reshape the global digital landscape to align with China's objectives. The IC must quickly improve its ability to identify and counter such efforts at scale and at machine speed, which will require investment in sophisticated technical capabilities now, not someday.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Consider this reality: while China can deploy new cyber capabilities on rapid timelines, the IC can take up to two years to procure and field comparable digital tools due to processes designed for a bygone analog era. Creating fast-track authorities means establishing dedicated pathways where software and digital services can be evaluated, tested, and deployed within weeks rather than following traditional procurement timelines. This also requires a concerted effort to drive genuine partnerships between government and private industry, the true engines of innovation, by creating new pathways for tech talent to serve short tours in government and streamlining how the IC adopts commercial technology.</p><p>Critics rightfully worry that rapid acquisition could compromise security or oversight. The solution is not slower processes, but smarter ones that leverage new AI capabilities by creating streamlined security reviews specifically designed for software, implementing continuous monitoring instead of front-loaded approvals (the one-and-done approach), and building accountability mechanisms that match the speed of digital threats.</p><p>The goal of intelligence reform should be clear: promote a culture of bold risk-taking, eliminate bureaucracy where it merely perpetuates itself, ruthlessly drive efficiency to free up precious resources, and reallocate those resources to the challenges of the future rather than the structures of the past. This requires immediate action from Congress to establish new acquisition authorities, from IC leadership to restructure internal processes, and from the private sector to engage more deeply with national security missions.</p><p>It would be a mistake to squander precious time in debates over bureaucratic power while our adversaries move forward aggressively. The United States must match and surpass their speed, innovation, and audacity, focusing exclusively on the real challenges ahead to secure America's digital future.

U.S. forces are deemed potential targets of retaliation and one U.S. airbase in Qatar did come under attack, albeit a largely symbolic one.</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Cipher Brief spoke with General Frank McKenzie (Ret.), who oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East as the head of U.S. Central Command from 2019 to 2022, about the mission and vulnerability of U.S. troops in the region, and what might happen if they were to leave. Our interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>The Iraq War is long over. The United States - in a coalition - defeated ISIS some time ago. The Afghan War is over. What is the mission or are the missions of all those troops that remain in the Middle East?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie: </em></strong></em>I would argue that the fight against ISIS still goes on. We don't actually fight that fight ourselves, but we do support our partners both in Iraq and in Syria who continue to conduct operations against ISIS, which is now newly flourishing based on the turmoil in Syria. That may correct itself over the next few months with the new government, which I think is a good thing. So we're still in that fight a little bit. But to your basic question, our forces are there to train our partners in the region, to work with them, to provide assurance of American presence, and that's largely focused on Iran. Iran remains a singular threat in the region, and we've seen over the last few months, why we need to be very aware and alert to the threat from Iran.</p><p>The other thing is that while we do have a lot of forces in the region, they are distributed. We defended ourselves very effectively against an Iranian attack a few days ago. And forces also provide assurance to our neighbors while they deter action by our potential opponents. Our friends in the region can't leave. They're stuck there, so the fact that U.S. forces are there actually adds to their level of assurance that we'll be a reliable partner should Iran attack them.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>A good many of those American troops are there at the invitation, if not the request, of some of the Gulf states. That's of course not the case for different reasons in Iraq and Syria. To what extent is the U.S. presence, in your view, an answer to those kinds of requests? And to what extent is it strategically smart for the United States?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie:</em></strong></em> It\u2019s a combination of both. It certainly serves our interest to maintain a presence in the region. It certainly serves the interests of the Gulf States and other states that we be there in order to give them additional stability as they confront the threat from Iran. So I think it serves both our interests. We\u2019re actually in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government now. I think we have an ongoing negotiation process with the Iraqis about what our force posture is going to be. So we're in Iraq because the Iraqis want us to be there, not because we're forcing ourselves on the Iraqis.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

We could leave the region, and that's talked about fairly frequently. If we left the region and drew down dramatically, then that assurance component would go away and they would also be, as an effective operational matter, far more vulnerable to attacks from Iran. We've seen how willing Iran is to actually use their military to attack their neighbors over the last few months. That's the thing to cover when we look at why our forces are there: what effects do we derive? Assurance and deterrence against Iranian attacks. </p><p>I think those are all useful things because that keeps the flow of commerce through the region, moving through the Strait of Hormuz. We've reopened the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait recently. I believe commerce is eventually going to flow again, though that's going to take a little time as insurance companies test the waters about what the Houthis are going to be willing to do. But all of those things are very much in our national interest.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>Let's talk about the vulnerability of some of those forces. You've had all those forces under your command. How difficult a task is it to go from whatever the baseline force protection is to us now attacking the nation of Iran? What's the ramp up like in terms of security?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie:</em></strong></em> We have exquisitely rehearsed and prepared plans to protect our forces. As the CENTCOM commander, you begin every day worrying about the force protection level of U.S. forces in the region, our embassies in the region, our American citizens in the region, as well as our friends and partners. So you look at that every day and you balance it against what the Iranians are doing. We have very good ways of knowing what the Iranians are thinking about and what they plan to do. So as we saw recently, we are typically able to adjust and prepare for that. The risk is always that you'll get it wrong or they'll get lucky, and we know and understand that. But we work very closely with forces in the region to ensure they're prepared for these types of things. It's a battle drill. It is an onerous thing to do. You're leaving the comfortable places you live. You're going to places that are certainly less comfortable, albeit for a short period of time, but it's one of the best ways we can effectively save the Iranians from themselves. If they were to attack us and cause significant U.S. casualties, then the potential for upward escalation is very high. We always say the Iranians own the lower steps on the escalation ladder. We own all the higher steps on the escalation ladder. Every CENTCOM commander spends a lot of time looking at that.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

You may not need as much as you've got right now. You need the ability to flow them back in very quickly if you elect to pull forces out. But what we have right now is an Iran that is effectively deterred. They chose not to launch a massive attack on us. Instead, they launched a very choreographed attack, and if we're to believe reporting, that was telegraphed well in advance because they did not want to get into significant combat with the United States \u2014 because they know and understand our capabilities. That's what these forces bring. To draw down precipitously would possibly undo that deterrent effect.</p><p>On the other hand, and this is something that really only the president of the United States can balance, he's a president who has struck Iran twice \u2014 [Quds Force Commander, General] <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/avenging-the-death-of-qassem-soleimani\" target=\"_self\"><u>Qassem Soleimani</u></a> back in 2020, and now this most recent attack. President Trump possesses extraordinary credibility with the Iranians because he's taken bold action two times, which puts him in a unique position that no other American president has had going back several administrations. </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em>D</em><em>o you think that President Trump might have some success in bringing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a place that looks more like a ceasefire in Gaza and a deal in Iran?</em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie: </em></strong></em>Short answer is, I don't know. I do know that we and Israel both share the same objective with Iran. We don't want them to have a nuclear weapon, and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of discussion on that, a lot of assessment. How effective were the strikes? Where are we? What needs to be done? I would assume they're going to spend a fair amount of time talking about that. But I would also say the same thing I said about President Trump and Iran. That same credibility probably extends to his relationship with Israel and the way going forward. So I'll watch with great interest to see what comes out of those meetings next week.</p><p><em><strong><em>Are you Subscribed to </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> on YouTube?

Brad Cooper, who was <a href=\"https://defensescoop.com/2025/06/30/combatant-commanders-centcom-eucom-brad-cooper-alexus-grynkewich/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed just this week</a> as the new CENTCOM commander, said he sees no reason to draw down now. </p><p>\u201cOur approach today is to assess and move forward on a conditions-based assessment,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he told</a> the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cI think, given the dynamic nature of what's happening today, that assessment in the future could look different than it does today, perhaps, and if confirmed, I'm committed into my tenure to continue to assess what our posture needs to look like and make recommendations.\u201d</p><p><strong>What are U.S. Troops Doing There</strong></p><p>For decades, the United States has kept tens of thousands of military personnel in the Middle East, spread across bases from Syria to the Persian Gulf. </p><p>Among the largest are the <a href=\"https://greydynamics.com/al-udeid-air-base-the-largest-us-military-installation-in-middle-east/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Al -Udeid Air Base</a> in Qatar, home to the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing and the forward headquarters of CENTCOM \u2013 with some 10,000 troops \u2013 and the U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet base <a href=\"https://installations.militaryonesource.mil/in-depth-overview/naval-support-activity-bahrain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in Bahrain</a>, where 9,000 Americans are deployed. 13,500 U.S. service members are stationed at <a href=\"http://v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bases in Kuwait</a> and another 5,000 in the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/12/mapping-us-troops-and-military-bases-in-the-middle-east\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">United Arab Emirates (UAE).</a> Maritime deployments that followed the Hamas massacre in Israel on October 7, 2023, added a few thousand troops to the overall number. Finally, roughly 3,000 Americans are stationed at bases in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/after-iran-proxy-strikes-should-u-s-troops-leave-iraq-and-syria\" target=\"_self\">Iraq and Syria,</a> vestiges of the anti-ISIS operations that were carried out a decade ago. </p><p>Proponents of the current force posture see a smart distribution of troops that matches U.S. interests and furthers several key missions: the ability to respond quickly to crises; countering the Iranian threat; bolstering the defense of Israel; helping secure maritime commerce in the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz; maintaining U.S. relations with key Gulf allies; and ensuring that ISIS and other groups do not reconstitute themselves and threaten U.S. interests. </p><p>\u201cThere are multiple missions at play,\u201d Cohen said, beyond the current operations against Iran. \u201cSome of this is a legacy of the global war on terrorism. We have soldiers in Syria and Iraq, doing primarily counter-ISIS missions, some stabilization missions as well. But we also have the major air bases in Bahrain for the Air Force and the Navy, managing air operations and the naval forces in the region. And what that means in practice, is we are concerned about the free flow of commerce through places like the Strait of Hormuz, and making sure that the Houthis don\u2019t interfere with global maritime traffic there as well.\u201d </p><p>Those arguing for a drawdown say that a force of 40,000 is far too costly, and that the stated missions are either outdated or could be accomplished with a much smaller number of troops. </p><p>\u201cMy longer-term view \u2013 even before the Iran strike \u2013 of the forces in the Middle East has been that when you have 40,000 forces in a region, anything that happens in that region implicates the United States, even things that actually aren't in U.S. interests,\u201d Kavanagh, the Defense Priorities director, told <em>The Cipher Brief.</em></p><p>\u201cTo the extent that we can get those forces out and limit unnecessary entanglements, I think that would be a smart move,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that doesn't necessarily mean that you could never operate in the Middle East if there were actually a threat. Air power and naval power is something that's very mobile, and if you had the support of the Gulf countries, you could operate from those bases again.\u201d</p><p><strong>The war against ISIS</strong></p><p>Officially, U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria serve as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, which began as a U.S.-led coalition in 2014 to dismantle the Islamic State (ISIS). Although that campaign was declared a success in Iraq (in 2017) and in Syria (2019), the U.S. maintains nearly 3,500 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/24/us-troops-attacked-syria-iraq-israel-hamas-gaza/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">troops</a> in the two countries. </p><p>Those bases are also considered the most vulnerable to outside attack, and well before the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes against Iran, analysts and policymakers were questioning the wisdom of keeping them there.</p><p>After Israel launched its war on Hamas in October 2023, these bases \u2013 along with a smaller outpost in Jordan \u2013 were attacked hundreds of times by rocket strikes that reportedly caused <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/40-us-service-members-may-brain-injuries-iran-linked-attacks-rcna123591\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dozens</a> of traumatic brain injuries among U.S. troops. In January 2024, three Americans <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/tower-22-and-the-path-to-a-wider-war\" target=\"_self\">were killed</a> and dozens were injured at the small \u201cTower 22\u201d base in Jordan. As <em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/tower-22-and-the-path-to-a-wider-war\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a></em> reported then, the deadly strike prompted calls for ending the Iraq and Syria deployments.</p><p>Bernard Hudson, a former director of counterterrorism at the CIA, told us then that U.S. troops in those countries were \u201cfolks in harm\u2019s way who can\u2019t be protected and are surrounded by Iranian elements in both countries.\u201d </p><p>Today, the case for staying in Syria and Iraq imagines a different nightmare: the Americans leave, and conditions are restored for a resurgent ISIS that could do more damage in the region and beyond. </p><p>\u201cI would argue that the fight against ISIS still goes on,\u201d Gen. McKenzie said. \u201cWe don't actually do that fight ourselves, but we do support our partners both in Iraq and in Syria who continue to conduct operations against ISIS, which is now newly flourishing based on the turmoil in Syria.\u201d </p><p>Cohen concurred. \u201cISIS is beaten down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not gone, though. And the concern is if you begin to take forces away, ISIS will sprout back up. There are also concerns that if we pull out, particularly out of Syria, we will risk abandoning the Kurds, who've been a long-time partner. So, there's an argument for keeping troops there for a host of both counterterrorism reasons, but also for regional stability issues.\u201d</p><p>Kavanagh countered that the threat to the U.S. was minimal, and not worth the investment in U.S. military force. </p><p>\u201cISIS is not a threat to the United States \u2013 at least not the ISIS that's operating in the Middle East,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people argue that ISIS-K is becoming a more global threat, but they're not in Iraq and Syria. And our intelligence community has been very effective at uncovering plots before they happen. So, I'm not convinced that you need a military presence to protect the United States from that threat.\u201d</p><p>The Defense Department has been conducting a \u201cposture review\u201d of the Iraq and Syria deployments for more than a year. The Iraq Higher Military Commission, which was tasked with preparing a U.S. withdrawal plan from that country, hasn\u2019t met since September, <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">according to <em>Defense One</em>.</a> Recently, Maine Senator Angus King returned from a visit to Iraq and said that officials there had asked for the American troops to remain. </p><p>\u201cThey have an election coming up this fall, and that's been one of the significant dangers,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sen. King said</a>, referring to potential threats from Iran-backed militias in Iraq. \u201cIt seems to me, given the renewed volatility\u2026it\u2019s not a good time to be drawing down our forces, because they are viewed as stabilizing forces in all of those countries in the Middle East.\u201c</p><p><strong>A rapid-reaction force \u2013 and the costs</strong></p><p>Many experts say that the brief war with Iran \u2013 and the tensions that linger in its aftermath \u2013 are only the latest examples of a longstanding reality: crises in the Middle East come with regularity. And that, they say, is reason enough for maintaining the American air and naval bases in the Gulf states. </p><p>Proponents of the U.S. posture also note that those Gulf allies want the Americans there. The U.S. has mutual defense agreements and commitments with Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain. An abrupt exit, they argue, could undermine relationships with those countries.</p><p>\u201cThere's a geopolitical bent here in that the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, they all value having a U.S. presence in the region,\u201d Jason Campbell, Senior Fellow at the Middle East Institute, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt provides them both a certain level of added security from Iran, as well as additional access for their respective militaries to training and certain types of equipment that are of use to them. So, there are both security and geopolitical reasons for the presence in this part of the world.\u201d</p><p>Detractors point to the costs \u2013 particularly of the larger bases in the Gulf. Sustaining U.S. forces in the Middle East is expensive, north of <a href=\"https://reason.com/2024/10/08/a-year-of-war-in-the-middle-east-cost-americans-nearly-23-billion/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">$20 billion</a> per year. Kavanagh and Caldwell argue that U.S. personnel in the region require more extensive defenses than those based at home, including hardened facilities and advanced air defenses, to protect them from Iranian-backed drone and missile attacks. </p><p>Meanwhile, each uptick in tensions has meant shifts to a high-alert status that carry their own costs. When the U.S. made the decision to strike Iran, most of the aircraft at the al-Udeid base in Qatar were moved out, and ships stationed at the U.S. naval base in Bahrain were sent out to sea as a security precaution. </p><p>\u201cThere is a heightened level of threat there,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThey'll move some of their naval ships out of Bahrain and out to sea to keep them safer\u2026These are typical things we see, leading up to and enduring periods of tension in the region.\u201d</p><p>Ultimately, none of those measures mattered much in the recent war; the Iranians were clearly not interested in escalation, and their public retaliation \u2013 for now at least \u2013 has been limited to a single well-telegraphed strike against the Al-Udeid base, which President Trump said had come with advance warning.</p><p>But Caldwell and Kavanagh argue that the costs and the vulnerability of these bases alone make the case for a drawdown, or at least a consolidation of U.S. forces in the region to one or two locations. </p><p>\u201cThe \u201812-Day War\u2019 fortunately did not cost any American lives,\u201d Caldwell and Kavanagh <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/28/iran-strike-american-military-vulnerability/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> in the Post, \u201cbut it highlighted our vulnerabilities in the region and underlined how our existing force posture was superfluous to achieving our aims. The war\u2019s end provides an opportunity for the United States to do what it has tried and failed to do for the better part of a decade: rationalize and downscale its presence in the Middle East.\u201d</p><p><strong>What comes next</strong> </p><p>All the past calls for a drawdown of American military power in the region ultimately ran into the same roadblock: It\u2019s hard to disengage from the Middle East. </p><p>President Donald Trump ran for a second term on a foreign policy platform that would decrease American involvement in the Middle East and pivot towards growing challenges in the Indo-Pacific. He referred to himself as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/10/trump-war-israel-gaza-ukraine-yemen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\u201ccandidate of peace,\u201d</a> with promises to extricate the U.S. from entanglements in the region. He may still do so; but like many of his predecessors, he has found it difficult to stay out of the region\u2019s turbulence.</p><p>\u201cI'm optimistic that once things stabilize, at least some of the air and naval power will move out of the region, because I do think there are strong voices in the Pentagon and elsewhere who really would like to concentrate more on Asia,\u201d Kavanagh said. \u201cAnd you can't do that when all your air and naval assets are tied up in the Middle East.\u201d</p><p>Even those experts who support the deployments say they welcome the discussions about their future.</p><p>\u201cThere's certainly debate to be had for the number of installations required,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHow many forces should indeed be there and what specific purpose should they serve? I think those are all fair questions, but again, the geopolitical costs of removing forces completely from the region could be higher than many realize.\u201d</p><p>Campbell added that a complete damage assessment of the strikes against Iran \u2013 which is not yet complete \u2013 will likely dictate the way forward, and that until then, there is a \u201cnear-to middle-term utility of having forces and resources in the region just from a more operational standpoint.\u201d</p><p>Cohen agrees, noting that despite Trump\u2019s claim that the nuclear sites in Iran had been \u201cobliterated,\u201d questions remain about the damage done and what may come next. </p><p>\u201cThere's an open question about how much destruction we actually did to the nuclear program with that strike,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAnd if you were to have a more sustained [U.S.] offensive, and if you actually wanted to do something somewhat larger that would actually have potentially a more permanent effect, you would need a bigger operation.\u201d And that, he said, would surely involve the American bases in the Gulf.</p><p>Gen. McKenzie, the former CENTCOM commander, said he welcomes the coming \u201cposture review,\u201d and the overall debate about U.S. forces in the Middle East. </p><p>\u201cThat's a national policy decision that we're going to have to make,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much do we want to leave in there? It's a careful calibration. You may not need as much as you've got right now, but you need the ability to flow them back in very quickly if you elect to pull forces out.\u201d</p><p>Ultimately, he said, \u201cWe could leave the region, we could certainly do that, and that's talked about fairly frequently.\u201d But he added that in the short term, that would hurt the U.S. deterrent effect against Iran, the ability to secure safe maritime commerce, and the relationship with those Gulf allies. </p><p>\u201cI think that's the thing to cover when we look at why are our forces there, what effects do they give, what effects do we derive from the fact that they're there \u2013 I think those are all useful things. All of those things are very much in our national interest.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

Litvinenko\u2019s resulting death from acute radiation syndrome significantly strained relations between the UK and Russia, leading to diplomatic expulsions and increased scrutiny of Russian activities in the UK.</p><p>As much as this event became pivotal in the relationships between London and Moscow and called for a major reassessment of the Kremlin\u2019s intentions and capabilities on European soil, it was still regarded by the rest of Europe mostly as a matter of Russia\u2019s internal issues \u2014 Litvinenko was Russian, he ardently criticised the Russian leadership and he was a high-ranking defector. Therefore, he was targeted by the Russian special services. The consensus in the West was that Russia targeted its own renegade citizens, and not citizens from European countries.</p><p>This proved to be a rather comfortable position for the political leadership of the EU at that time (primarily German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy), which was in the middle of exploring deeper economic ties and a more intertwined commerce with Russia.</p><p>This position allowed the economic and political powerhouses of Europe to safely qualify Moscow\u2019s explicitly hostile actions around the same time towards countries like Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Georgia as mere quarrels between the former Soviet republics. The Kremlin\u2019s distribution of Russian passports in Latvia in 2004; the Kremlin\u2019s blockade of rail and ports and manipulation of theDruzhba pipeline oil supply in retaliation for losing the bid for Lithuania\u2019s only oil refinery Ma\u017eeiki\u0173 Nafta; or Russia\u2019s complete ban of imports of Georgian wines as a punishment for Tbilisi\u2019s pro-Western stance in 2006 \u2013 all these events were disregarded as merely regional tensions between the former USSR cohabitants.</p><p>The Swedish airspace incursion that happened the same year, when a Russian military aircraft without active transponders flew simulated attack runs near Gotland, didn\u2019t match this story, but was mainly ignored as an unfortunate mistake in the then non-NATO sky.</p><p>In 2007, when the websites of Estonia\u2019s government, parliament, banks, ministries, newspapers, and broadcasters websites faced the most massive cyber-attack in history, which coincided with a dispute with Russia over the relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, a Soviet-era monument paramount for the Kremlin\u2019s WW2 mythology, the same whispering was heard in EU high cabinets \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a matter of Russia\u2019s backyard\u201d. Nobody would dare to openly call an independent EU state \u201cRussia\u2019s backyard\u201d, but the reaction towards this incident, widely considered the first major state-on-state cyberattack, was telltale.</p><p>The same year, Putin gave his notorious \u2018Munich speech\u2019 \u2014\u2018\u2019The speech in which Putin has told us who he was\u201d, as<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/18/putin-speech-wake-up-call-post-cold-war-order-liberal-2007-00009918\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Politico has put it</u></a>. Among his disturbing and grim messages, one was particularly ominous: \u2018Whether we should be indifferent and aloof to various internal conflicts inside [other] countries? Of course not.\u2019</p><p>This message didn\u2019t take long to materialize. In 2008 Russia invaded Georgia under the pretext of protecting Russian citizens and peacekeepers in the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. This was the climax of the \u201cRussia\u2019s backyard\u201d attitude. Numerous former members of Mikheil Saakashvili\u2019s team, the then-president of Georgia, said that in private conversations with Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel, Condoleezza Rice and their teams, these foreign leaders and their advisors articulated the futility of resistance and the need to accept the reality imposed by the Kremlin. \u201cAccepting this reality\u201d would mean recognizing that Russia does indeed hold a claim on Georgia, which naturally derives from the common soviet history. (Later in 2014 some representatives of the EU behind closed doors were promoting the same thought regarding Crimea).</p><p>Unfortunately, these and many other hostile actions failed to seriously alarm both the American and European political elites of that period, who were seriously engaged in a \u201cRussian reset\u201d. In 2009 Russian military aircraft again violated Swedish airspace, Moscow cut off gas supplies to Ukraine in the dead of winter (affecting also European countries dependent on gas transiting through Ukraine), and Kremlin-backed hackers attacked the German government.</p><p>In the 2010s Russia, either directly or through its proxies, effectuated cyber attacks on the German and Finnish governments, as well as on energy distribution networks in Sweden; sabotaged arms depots in Czechia; stirred up ethnic tensions in Germany with the \u2018Lisa Case\u2019; hacked TV5Monde and manipulated social media to encourage chaos during Yellow Vests protests in France; infiltrated the Aviation Sector and the Spiez laboratory in Switzerland; attempted to assassinate an arms dealer in Bulgaria; and targeted US and Canada diplomats in Cuba and later in other countries (the \u2018Cuba syndrome\u2019).</p><p>Moscow supported anti-fracking movements in Romania to prevent it from developing its own natural gas resources; attempted a coup in Montenegro; jammed Finland\u2019s and Norway\u2019s GPS signals; backed the hacking of the World Anti-Doping Agency; and attempted to sabotage the global internet infrastructure by exploring vulnerabilities in undersea Internet cables connecting Europe and North America.</p><p>Closer to the 2020s Russian operatives attempted to intercept secure military communications from a French military satellite; the Kremlin imposed trade restrictions on Moldovan agricultural products and manipulated energy prices in response to Kishinev\u2019s increased engagement with the EU; and Moscow manipulated the energy market in Bulgaria by restricting gas supplies.</p><p>Russia systematically meddled in top tier popular voting across the globe, with the following being subjects of major investigations for alleged Russian interference: the 2016 UK Brexit referendum, 2016 US presidential elections, 2017 French presidential elections, 2017 German federal elections, 2018 Finnish presidential elections and the 2019 European parliament elections.</p><p>The amount of money and effort spent by the Kremlin to fund and cultivate separatist, xenophobic, anti-Western, Eurosceptic, anti-Americanist, radical, extreme and divisive parties, movements, groups and organizations across the Transatlantic community since Putin came to power is overwhelming.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there.

For any war to be \u201cnever again\u201d meant that peace must be \u201cforever\u201d. Hence, attaining peace morphed from a righteous and pragmatic complex objective into a quasi-religious ideology that rejects the mere plausibility of conflict \u2013 \u201ca deep peace\u201d.</p><p>A \"Deep peace\" is not merely a state of prolonged absence of war. The doctrine posits that the very discussion of potential martial threats or military readiness could, paradoxically, invoke the specter of war itself. This ideology has been perpetuated by a sustained period of peace which, rather than being seen as a delicate, demanding and maintained state, is viewed as a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>This means that for \u2018peacewalkers\u2019, the modern-day political apostles of this new security cult, peace is self-reinforcing. The longer they can keep the peace, the stronger on their opinion it gets, and the less probable war is. Hence the obsession with preserving peace at all costs, even if such costs are clearly whetting the appetite of the predator, who never really bothered to camouflage his hostile intentions. This almost irrational refusal to accept any possibility of another conflict on the continent, as if it were a fantasy, a fairytale, a myth, has been ruling out the very discussion of the flaws of current peace and its disproportions, as these very discussions were believed to invite war.</p><p>It seems that only at the Munich Security Conference of 2025 western leaders finally realized that war is now not just at their doorstep \u2013 it has already rung the bell.</p><p>This state of \u201cdeep peace\u201d is precisely the reason why all the signals of hostility from Russia have been ignored by the peacewalkers. This was seen in the reaction of the major western governments\u2019 defence budgets to the overt military interventions conducted by Russia in Georgia, in the Middle East and in Ukraine before 2022\u2014the increase of defense spending was literally marginal.</p><p>Both European and American defense spending remained disproportionately low. The European Union's defense budget gradually declined from 4% of GDP in 1960 to a historic low of 1.3% of GDP in 2014. It wasn't until 2020 that European defense spending saw a \u201cnoticeable\u201d increase of 0.3% - up to 1.6% of GDP.</p><p>A similar trend was observed in the United States, where defense spending as a share of GDP stagnated and mostly declined throughout the 2010s, following the peak of the War on Terror. U.S. military expenditure steadily fell from around 4.5% of GDP in 2010 to 3.2% by 2017, even as Russia ramped up its global assertiveness under Putin\u2019s second presidency. It wasn\u2019t until 2020 that U.S. defense spending rebounded to 3.7%, reflecting a shift in priorities as geopolitical tensions escalated.</p><p>The fact that both European and American defense spending remained stagnant for most of the 2010s, suggests that the West did not perceive even Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine as a serious enough threat to warrant an immediate military buildup. This delayed response underscores the extent to which policymakers in both Europe and the U.S. underestimated the long-term implications of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas, as much as Russia being a direct threat.</p><p>Once again, the pervasive\u2014almost sacrosanct\u2014belief in the enduring power of 'deep peace' has led to the deliberate overlooking of clear signals of impending conflict. This illusion of unassailable peace, fostered by decades of relative stability and economic interdependence, has engendered a dangerous complacency among western, but mainly European, nations.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em>Sign up today</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em>.</em></strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>False Idols</strong></p><p>In order to start thinking about how to fix this situation, we first need to understand how we got here. What beliefs guided decision makers? Within what ideological framework did they operate?</p><p>The first reference point is the perception of national security through the lens of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</p><p>The evolution of the role and, more importantly, the capabilities of NATO in the minds of its members happened under the influence of a prolonged peace on the European continent, with some successful military interventions of its members in the 1990s and 2010s, as well as of a certain image of a hi-tech undefeatable army produced by American pop-culture.</p><p>As a result, NATO has become more of a religious icon, rather than a real military force. The belief in NATO\u2019s capacity has become unconditional and it has fastened the religion of \u201cdeep peace\u201d (which is indeed very similar to a religion because of its irrationality), by providing an image of an almighty protector, which will always intervene in case of trouble.</p><p>The truth is, however, a bit different. While NATO might have proven itself successful in regional conflicts like Yugoslavia or the Middle East, it was never ready to face a full-scale war with a proper adversary like Russia or China. It was even less prepared to face hybrid warfare, with war being waged not only with bombs and bullets, but with information and narratives.</p><p>The reliance on nuclear power was paramount in NATO\u2019s deterrence strategy. The war Russia has launched against Ukraine, however, has shown that nuclear weapons deter only the use of other nuclear weapons \u2013 not conventional ones. </p><p>One might argue that the aggression against Ukraine is very different from a hypothetical aggression against NATO, and if Russia were to invade a member of the Treaty the retaliation would be dramatically different. Perhaps. How can, however, the nuclear arsenal defend even member countries against \u2018the green men\u2019, the scam referendums, the total blackouts due to cyber-attacks, the skirmishes with emigrants along the borders, arson of ammunition stores and further hybrid tactics? This begs a clear answer.</p><p>Therefore, a NATO membership can hardly serve as a justification for not having a powerful military able to defend one\u2019s country against an invasion. This, however, was precisely the belief of the \u2018peacewalkers\u2019 for decades: \u2018NATO will take care of us, and it has nukes. We\u2019re safe\u2019.</p><p>Russia has proved them wrong. And now the new White House administration is considering a major NATO policy shift, where the U.S. might not defend a fellow NATO member that is attacked, if the country doesn\u2019t meet the defense spending threshold. Given the alternative view on global security the new U.S. leadership has taken, the moment Washington refuses to invoke Article 5 following a hypothetical encroachment on a member-state \u2013 the world as we know it is finished.</p><p>Another belief where Russia has proved everyone wrong is the na\u00efve idea that it can be deterred by trade. And yet, even the current U.S. administration seems to be falling into this trap once again.</p><p>This illusion has deep roots. Since the early 2000s, the dominant Western orthodoxy held that deeper trade and economic interdependence with Russia would tame its aggressive instincts and gradually bind it to the liberal international order. From Germany\u2019s embrace of <em><em>Wandel durch Handel</em></em> to the U.S. push for Russia\u2019s WTO accession in 2012, the assumption was always the same: prosperity would soften Moscow, and mutual gain would deter aggression.</p><p>It did the opposite.</p><p>The trick is that the fruits and benefits of trade relations are used very differently in democracies and autocracies. While democracies invest the spoils of trade into raising the quality of life of their citizens\u2014because that is the social contract at the heart of their legitimacy\u2014autocratic regimes like Russia spend those same profits on the <em><em>quality of oppression</em></em>: strengthening their propaganda machines and expanding the coercive reach of their security services. These are the twin pillars of modern authoritarian rule.</p><p>In the 2000s, as Russia reaped massive windfalls from energy exports, it poured resources into rebuilding and modernizing its military. Military spending jumped from just $9 billion in 2000 to over $60 billion by 2014. At the same time, Putin\u2019s regime systematically increased funding for the security services and domestic repression apparatus. By 2025, Russia will allocate a staggering 6.3% of its GDP\u2014over $145 billion\u2014to defense, surpassing even Cold War-era levels. In parallel, the budget for internal security, which includes the FSB and National Guard, accounts for over 10% of the federal budget, while state propaganda organs like RT and VGTRK are receiving $1.4 billion annually, an increase of 13% over the previous year.</p><p>Meanwhile, spending on social programs in Russia is projected to fall by 16% in 2025. The regime is not interested in improving the lives of its citizens\u2014it is interested in controlling them.</p><p>Hence, while Russia has been methodically preparing for war, both externally and internally, the West spent the same decades investing in the illusion of a deepening peace. Defense budgets shrank, armies were downsized, and strategic industries were allowed to atrophy. Europe, in particular, funneled billions into Russian energy infrastructure like Nord Stream, while simultaneously allowing itself to become strategically dependent on the very regime it hoped to pacify.</p><p>In the end, the West was trading with Russia under the illusion that it was exporting stability. In reality, it was importing vulnerability.</p><p><strong>Epilogue: the trench of the Saints</strong></p><p>In the end, however, it is not doctrines, nukes, trade or alliances that hold the gates. It is the trench of the saints\u2014where exhausted, ordinary Ukrainians still stand between us and the abyss. </p><p>And yet, instead of standing behind them as one would behind the gates of a besieged city, much of the West regards their resistance with fatigue, irritation, even suspicion\u2014treating Ukraine not as a rampart, but as a liability. The war, they whisper, drags on. The costs are too high. Perhaps it\u2019s time to talk peace, meaning: surrender something, accept something, pretend that nothing essential is lost.</p><p>But what is being lost is everything.</p><p>The trench of the Ukrainian soldier is not only a physical line against Russian advance. It is the symbolic front line of a deeper war\u2014between freedom and tyranny, law and brute force, future and regression. Just as in the 20th century, when the free world had to rally to crush the Nazi regime not with half-measures but with full moral clarity, so too must the West now realize: Ukraine is not the cause of this war\u2019s duration. Ukraine is the reason we still have time.</p><p>If we abandon that trench\u2014or fail to fully support it\u2014we are not avoiding war. We are inviting a greater one.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><em>\u201cOn both sides they imagined that \u2018bluffing\u2019 would suffice to achieve success.

But Musk and his companies still hired more lobbyists this year than any other since 2021, according to data from the Texas Ethics Commission. </p>\n\n<p>Musk, the billionaire businessman behind carmaker Tesla and aerospace company SpaceX, influenced several new Texas laws this year. How his lobbyists came about these wins, however, is more of a mystery.</p>\n\n<p>His lobbyists, who represented Tesla, SpaceX and the social media giant X Corp., spent tens of thousands of dollars on things like gifts and meals for Texas elected officials and others during the session, according to an analysis of state ethics data. In most cases, Texas transparency laws do not require lobbyists to disclose which politicians they wined and dined or on behalf of which clients.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>The Texas Newsroom reached out to all 12 of Musk\u2019s lobbyists registered with the state this session. Only one, Carrie Simmons, a lobbyist who counts Tesla among her clients, responded, but she declined to be interviewed. She said only Musk\u2019s companies could comment on their work this session. </p>\n\n<p>Emails sent to Musk\u2019s companies and to Musk himself were not returned. </p>\n\n<p>The Texas Newsroom was able to find hints of some of their actions in records obtained from Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and state Sen. Adam Hinojosa. Other documents detailing their deeper connections are hidden from disclosure by state laws.</p>\n\n<p>Ethics experts said the responsibility to improve transparency lies with Texas lawmakers. State law provides a \u201cbase level of transparency\u201d for the public on who lobbyists are and who they represent, said Andrew Cates, a former lobbyist who wrote a guide on state ethics rules. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cBeyond that, the Legislature simply has not prioritized enough transparency in how the dollars are actually being spent on legislators on a regular basis. But that\u2019s not the lobby\u2019s fault, it\u2019s the Legislature\u2019s,\u201d Cates said. </p>\n\n<p>Tom Forbes, president of the Professional Advocacy Association of Texas, a statewide lobbyist organization, said while lobbyists sometimes get a bad rap, they play a critical role for lawmakers trying to make decisions on complex policies. He told The Texas Newsroom that his group is \u201cagnostic\u201d about making reporting requirements more stringent but will follow any changes the state implements. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur association is going to comply with whatever law the Legislature passes,\u201d Forbes said.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        Who did Musk hire and who did they lobby?\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Eight of Musk\u2019s lobbyists worked for SpaceX, according to filings with the Ethics Commission. Tesla had four, one of whom also worked for X.</p>\n\n<p>Musk\u2019s lobbyists include former advisers and staffers for Gov. Greg Abbott, among them Mike Toomey and Reed Clay. Another lobbyist, Will McAdams, once sat on the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which regulates the state\u2019s electric, telecommunications, and water and sewer utilities.</p>\n\n<p>All but one lobbyist had other clients for whom they were also working, making it more difficult to track exactly how much spending went to further Musk\u2019s agenda. Benjamin Lancaster, a former legislative staffer, was only on SpaceX\u2019s payroll.</p>\n\n<p>Lobbyists are not required to report their exact salaries, only a pay range. According to Ethics Commission data, Musk pledged to pay somewhere between about $400,000 to nearly $1 million in total to his lobbyists for their work this year. Half of them could rake in more than $110,000 each working for Musk\u2019s companies.</p>\n\n<p>Each month, lobbyists report their total spending. But state rules don\u2019t require them to disclose who was on the receiving end unless the lobbyist shelled out more than $132.60 on one person in a single day. This includes food and beverages, transportation, lodging or entertainment. Taxes and tips are not counted. The disclosure threshold for gifts is $110.</p>\n\n<p>Lobbyists also don\u2019t need to disclose exactly who attended events to which all legislators were invited, like catered lunches for the entire Texas House of Representatives or happy hours hosted off-site.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, these rules mean a lobbyist could buy the same elected official a steak dinner every night. As long as the daily cost stays under that amount, they don\u2019t need to say who got the free meal.</p>\n\n<p>Musk\u2019s lobbyists spent more than $46,000 on food and drink alone for elected officials and their staff, family and guests this year, according to state ethics records. None of them detailed which elected officials may have been on the receiving end, implying all of their spending remained beneath the daily threshold.</p>\n\n<p>Jim Clancy, the former chair of the Ethics Commission, said it\u2019s common for multiple lobbyists to divide a single bill in order to stay below the reporting threshold. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey have 15 different credit cards in the deal to make sure that it\u2019s all below the limit,\u201d Clancy told The Texas Newsroom. \u201cThe Legislature has to change it. And if they did, they wouldn\u2019t get to eat for free.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/28/texas-legislature-ethics-bills-campaign-lobbying/\">slate of ethics bills</a>, including several to require transparency into who funds mass text messages for political campaigns, failed to become law this year, according to The Texas Tribune. Meanwhile, legislators <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB2781\">approved a new law</a> that will reduce the fine for former lawmakers who engage in illegal lobbying activity.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        What do other records show?\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>While lobbyists are not required to disclose which bills they discuss in private meetings with officials and their staff, they must note their position if they choose to testify on a piece of legislation. This is how The Texas Newsroom identified the 13 bills on which Musk\u2019s lobbyists took a public stance. </p>\n\n<p>The Texas Newsroom was able to glean some additional insight on lobbyist influence from records received through public information requests.</p>\n\n<p>Calendars for Hinojosa, a newly elected South Texas Republican who authored multiple bills that would benefit SpaceX and other aerospace companies, showed he or his staff had meetings scheduled with lobbyists or representatives from Musk\u2019s rocket company at least three times in two months. Emails showed Patrick penned a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration supporting SpaceX\u2019s ability to increase the number of launches at its South Texas rocket site.</p>\n\n<p>Patrick was also invited to take a tour of the Tesla Gigafactory outside Austin, these records showed, but it\u2019s unclear if he went.</p>\n\n<p>Neither Hinojosa nor Patrick responded to requests for an interview.</p>\n\n<p>The Texas Senate declined to release other documents that could have shed light on how Musk\u2019s companies interacted with elected officials. In denying their release, Senate Secretary Patsy Spaw said communications between state lawmakers and Texas residents are \u201cconfidential by law.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The reason, she said, is \u201cto ensure the right of citizens of the state to petition their state government without fear of harassment, retaliation or public ridicule.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>This could include emails with lobbyists.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Lauren McGaughy is a journalist with <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/texasnewsroom\">The Texas Newsroom</a>, a collaboration among NPR and the public radio stations in Texas.

The designation is justified, given Iran\u2019s continued support of proxies and criminal organizations that kill and terrorize innocent people. That behavior continues today, with the government of Ali Hosseini Khamenei surveilling, harassing, and detaining thousands of Iranians for allegedly aiding Israel -- and offending the morality police, who enforce Iran\u2019s dress code for women.</p><p>The U.S. \u2013 Israel bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites in Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow was more than justified. Iran was enriching uranium at 60% purity, a few weeks away from 90% purity for nuclear weapons. And given Iran\u2019s stated intent to destroy Israel, the bombing of these nuclear sites made imminent sense, especially given the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) recent report that Iran was concealing information on its nuclear program, to include weaponization.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

One of those officers was the visiting Director of the Office of Near East and South Asia Analysis, Robert C. Ames.</p><p>In October 1983, the Iranian government was found responsible for the Beirut barracks bombing by the Islamic Jihad Organization, which killed 241 U.S. service members, 58 French soldiers and 6 civilians, injuring 60. </p><p>These two terrorist bombings apparently emboldened Iran into thinking that terrorism can be effective in eroding U.S. resolve. Thus, Iran continued to support their proxies \u2013 Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen, and Shiite groups in Iraq and Syria \u2013 in its war with the U.S. and Israel.</p><p>In June 1996, Iran was behind the bombing of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 airmen and 498 U.S. and international military and civilian members injured. A U.S. court ruled that Iran \u2013 and its proxy Hezbollah Al-Hejaz -- was responsible for the attack, providing the funding, support and direction.</p><p>This was the very overt Iran, confident in perpetrating these bold acts of terrorism.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

The international community saw some of this in 2009, when the government ensured that incumbent Mahmood Ahmadinejad was reelected president, despite opposition leader, Mir -Hossein Mousavi, having widespread support from the public, promising hope and change. This \u201cGreen Movement\u201d galvanized the Iranian people, resulting in protests, demonstrations and civil disobedience. The regime\u2019s response was predictable: using brutal force to suppress the demonstrations and arrest the protesters.</p><p>This has always been the regime\u2019s response to peaceful protests: suppressing and arresting the protesters. We saw this in September 2022 when Jina Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian -- died in police custody; arrested by the so-called morality policy for improperly wearing her Hijab headscarf. Eyewitnesses reported that Amini was severely beaten and died because of police brutality. </p><p>The Iranian people were irate with the brutal death of Amini. Protests erupted throughout Iran. Iran Human Rights reported that at least 476 people were killed by security forces. Amnesty International reported that Iranian security forces fired into groups with live ammunition and killed protesters by beating them with batons.</p><p>Amini\u2019s death gave rise to the global movement of: Woman, Life, Liberty.</p><p>The regime is now conducting a war against its own people, with widespread arrests of anyone protesting human rights abuses and corruption of the regime in power. </p><p>We would be remiss if we think the Ayatollah has given up on the use of terrorism to intimidate and deal with critics in opposition to his leadership. We would also be remiss if we think the theocracy will cease pursuing a nuclear weapons capability. The regime wants sanctions relief, and they\u2019re prepared to eschew nuclear weapons to get this relief. Eventually, however, they will pursue their nuclear weapons program. We should be prepared.</p><p><strong><em>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/1/irans-terror-legacy-ayatollahs-regime-still-poses-deadly-threat-us/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Times</a></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</em></strong></p><a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em></em></strong></em></u></a>",

Since we are <em>The Cipher Brief</em>, our favorites include not only thrillers and realistic, fast-paced novels \u2013 but some notable works of non-fiction on matters of national security, intelligence and foreign policy. And there\u2019s a cookbook thrown in for good measure.</p><p>We\u2019ve carefully combed through the books that we\u2019ve recently had reviewed by experts who have lived the spy or spy-related life - and we\u2019ve singled out some titles we think you might enjoy at the beach or wherever you\u2019re taking refuge from the summer heat. (<em>And just a note: if you do click and buy using links, we might make a small commission. At least enough to pay for the paper this was printed on.)</em></p><p>Let\u2019s get cooking, shall we?</p><p><strong>Cookbook / Whiskey Category</strong></p><p>Yep, you read that right. Leading our list of summer reads is one that has taken over the #1 spot in Amazon\u2019s whiskey and alcoholic spirits categories, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ZLkEJ4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Spy Walked Into A Bar: A Practitioner's Guide to Cocktail Tradecraft</a></em> by former senior CIA Officers Rob Dannenberg and Joseph P. Mullin Jr. Think of it as a real-life guide to spies and their favorite cocktails. Based on experiences from their clandestine operations backgrounds, Rob and Joe have collected, curated and perfected the cocktails that were enjoyed while celebrating milestone events during their CIA careers. From the drinks they ordered after successfully recruiting assets, to marking the end of a major operation, this book features real life stories and homegrown photos by the authors themselves. </p><p><strong>Novels</strong></p><p>Appropriate for summer, is a new spy novel from Tess Gerritsen, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3G5J0qp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Summer Guests: A Thriller</a></em>. This is Tess\u2019 second spy book, after her very successful TV series a few years ago called <em>Rizzoli and Isles</em>. Gerritsen <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-real-life-spy-coast\" target=\"_self\">talked</a> with Cipher Brief CEO & Publisher Suzanne Kelly about her journey from the popular TV series to spy author in the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-real-life-spy-coast\" target=\"_self\">Cover Stories podcast</a> \u2013 that was just after her first book, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/40wPPIc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Spy Coast</a> </em>was released. Veteran CIA officers Jay and Anne Gruner <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/martinis-and-murder-in-maine\" target=\"_self\">reviewed her latest book</a> about four retired CIA officers living in Maine. The Gruners tell us it is a \u201cgripping account of a complex set of murders, a possible recent kidnapping, and a secretary who was missing for 50 years.\u201d talking about her previous spy-themed book. </p><p>Former U.S. counterterrorism officer and cybersecurity executive Neal Pollard broke the code on Ken Dekleva\u2019s novel, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4nv3byF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Russian Diplomat\u2019s Wife</a></em>. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/i-spy-a-love-story\" target=\"_self\">In his review</a>, Neal says while the book ostensibly is a spy novel set in Vienna, it\u2019s really a love story between two spies. Author (and frequent Cipher Brief contributor) Dekleva draws on his experience as a psychiatrist working for the State Department in many of the locales central to the book and his understanding of human motivation seems to bring his stories to life. We know because we also interviewed the author for the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-russian-diplomats-wife\" target=\"_self\">Cover Stories Podcast.</a></p><p>Speaking of Dekleva, we tapped his expertise to review several books by other authors this year. One worthy of special mention is <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44HgTqG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Poet\u2019s Game: A Spy in Moscow</a></em> by Paul Vidich. Dekleva <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/paul-vidichs-moscow-get-off-the-x\" target=\"_self\">calls</a> the novel is a terrific read about a former CIA station chief in Moscow, now working as an investor in a private equity market in Moscow. The chief was called back to duty though to exfiltrate a former agent who claims to have explosive kompromat regarding America\u2019s president. Navigating between two perilous worlds, those of Moscow and Washington, the storyline seems to offer proof that the cold war never really ended.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em> </em></p><p>Going back even further in time, Dekleva also reviewed <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3GnrWw2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Assignment in Saigon: A Cold War Thriller</a></em> by former senior CIA officer Bill Rapp. In <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/bill-rapps-vietnam-a-different-kind-of-cold-war\" target=\"_self\">his review</a>, Dekleva says that to truly understand the intelligence war in Vietnam, fiction may offer more to the reader and Rapp\u2019s novel is a most worthy read.</p><p>Spy mastery is the theme of retired senior CIA officer Jim Lawler\u2019s latest novel, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44tlQSC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Traitors Tale: A Novel of Treachery within the CIA</a></em>. We turned to another seasoned Agency officer, and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/joseph-w-augustyn\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief expert</a>, Joe Augustyn, to <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/from-spy-master-to-story-teller\" target=\"_self\">review it</a>. Augustyn told us: \u201cJim Lawler has written an intriguing and captivating novel that should satisfy the appetite of any spy novel enthusiast. His character descriptions are impressive, his knowledge of the Agency, its bureaucracy and its inner workings is deep, and his operational savvy is on display throughout. Impressive too is his understanding of the dynamics of personal relationships, both professional and personal, which he calls the \u201cmetaphysics\u201d of spying.\u201d You can learn more about Lawler and his book from this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhEpYXdinnE&amp;t=5s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cover Stories Podcast interview</a>.</p><p><strong>Non- Fiction</strong></p><p>While we have reported on a ton of fine fiction over the past six months, real life stories, history and analysis have played an even larger role in our coverage. Among the books we\u2019d like to invite (or re-invite) to your attention here are: <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4ev0Qzu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Secret Servants of the Crown: The Forgotten Women of British Intelligence</a></em> by Claire Hubbard-Hall and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/neither-swallows-nor-amazons\" target=\"_self\">reviewed</a> for us by Cipher Brief expert <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/tim-willasey-wilsey\" target=\"_self\">Tim Willasey-Wilsey</a>, a real-life former member of the British Foreign Office. Willasey-Wilsey called it a \u201cmarvelous book and a valuable addition to what is known about the early days of the British secret services.\u201d We were lucky to have the author join us on a <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/secret-servants-of-the-crown\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief Cover Stories podcast</a> as well, describing the untold tales of women who silently served \u2013 including Katleen Pettigrew who was the inspiration for Ian Fleming\u2019s \u201cMiss Moneypenny\u201d in the James Bond novels.</p><p>For an American take on unsung women in intelligence, there is <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44sFiiG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Propaganda Girls: The Secret War of the Women of the OSS</a></em> by Lisa Rogak. The former director of the CIA\u2019s Office of Public Affairs, Tammy Kupperman Thorp <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/propaganda-girls-world-war-ii\" target=\"_self\">reviewed</a> the book that focuses on four women who played significant roles in the Office of Strategic Service (OSS) influence campaigns during World War II. She writes that women members of the OSS were in charge of \u201cblack propaganda\u201d primarily a \u201cseries of believable lies designed to cause the enemy soldiers to lose heart and ultimately surrender.\u201d </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

For a fascinating look at that life, check out <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/400hOzY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Story of a CIA Wife: Married to the Craft</a></em> by Rosie Mowatt-Larssen. Veteran journalist and contributing Cipher Brief editor Elaine Shannon <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/a-cia-wifes-tale-of-slipping-kgb-tails-and-other-stories-from-the-cold\" target=\"_self\">reviewed that one</a> for us and lauds the author\u2019s \u201crazor wit\u201d and tales of life in numerous overseas posts including time in Moscow where she helped slip KGB tails, serviced dead drops and lived a life that at times was the stuff of spy thrillers. For more on Rosie \u2013 check out her interview with us for the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/story-of-a-cia-wife\" target=\"_self\">Cover Stories podcast</a>.</p><p>We also have several books about action in World War II that we\u2019d recommend. Let\u2019s start with <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4evexOX\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nothing But Courage: The 82nd Airborne\u2019s Daring D-Day Mission and Their Heroic Charge Across the La Fi\u00e8re Bridge</a></em> by James Donovan. We went to a subject matter expert <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/normandy-la-fiere\" target=\"_self\">to review</a> that one \u2013 retired Army Major General Jack Leide. The book tells of one of the most operationally important but lesser-known stories of World War II. Leide praised the author for providing \u201cincredibly insightful and intricate descriptions and actions of, not only the allied and German military forces arrayed against each other, but how the operation affected many of the local French residents and resistance forces as well.\u201d</p><p>For a far less heroic view of some of the events in that war, there is <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4la0aCs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Traitor of Arnhem: The Untold Story of WWII\u2019s Greatest Betrayal and the Moment that Changed History Forever</a></em> by Robert Verkaik. Recently declassified British MI-5 documents help animate this story of a strategic failure that delayed Allied victory in the war and came at a steep human cost. CIA veteran (and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/martin-petersen\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief expert</a>) Martin Peterson <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/martin-petersen\" target=\"_self\">reviewed the book</a> for us and writes that the author makes a strong circumstantial case that Anthony Blunt, one of Russia\u2019s British agents, played a vital role in passing intelligence to the Germans that damaged the Allies chances of success.</p><p>For a story about operational and intelligence success, there\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44Hi1uq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Taking Midway: Naval Warfare, Secret Codes and the Battle that Turned the Tide of World War II</a></em> by Martin Dugard. Had the Battle of Midway turned out differently, Hawaii and the west coast of the United States stood vulnerable to Japanese attack. The battle was won by the U.S. though through a combination of steely leadership by Admiral Chester Nimitz, and brilliant cryptological work led by a quirky Lieutenant Commander named Joe Rochefort. Normally, our go-to source for book reviewers are gray-haired subject matter experts. For this one, we tried something different and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/taking-a-look-at-the-battle-of-midway\" target=\"_self\">gave the mission to Jack Montgomery</a>, a U.S. Navy ensign currently serving on a Japan-based ship. Montgomery, whose master\u2019s degree thesis was on the Solomon Islands Campaign, notes that the author\u2019s writing style with short punchy sentences makes the book a quick, enjoyable and informative read. Dugard joined us for a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rJ9shOAFZCA?si=_IxSVx-Q3azttufC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cover Stories podcast</a> recently in which he explained how he developed his story-telling style and researched the book.</p><p>Another book sure to fascinate many Cipher Brief readers is <em><a href=\"file://The%20Determined%20Spy/%20The%20Turbulent%20Life%20and%20Times%20of%20CIA%20Pioneer%20Frank%20Wisner\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Determined Spy: The Turbulent Life and Times of CIA Pioneer Frank Wisner</a></em> by veteran journalist Doug Waller. Wisner\u2019s story sounds like fiction. Standout track star in college, lawyer, innovative leader in the OSS during World War II, one of the founders of the CIA, author of successful and unsuccessful covert actions, prominent player in the Georgetown social set \u2013 but victim of what would now be called bipolar disorder \u2013 an illness that eventually led to his taking of his own life. Former senior CIA officer (and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/michael-sulick\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief expert</a>) Mike Sulick <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/covert-action-mental-health-and-a-cold-war-legend-the-story-of-frank-wisner\" target=\"_self\">reviewed</a> the book for us noting that the bio was long overdue and \u201can invaluable contribution to understanding the rewards and pitfalls of covert action as a tool of American foreign policy.\u201d Waller joined us in a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Bb4J847fJi8?si=k1-5aJaPYKDsHrEP\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cover Stories podcast</a> to share some of the secrets of writing about this trailblazing figure of U.S. intelligence.</p><p>A trailblazer of a different kind was Major General Jack Leide whose book, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3IapKsg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Professional Courage: My Journey in Military Intelligence Through Peace, Crisis and War</a></em>, was featured in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/telling-it-like-it-is\" target=\"_self\">a January review</a>. Leide has been inducted into four different military halls of fame. The stories he tells \u2013 and the lessons learned in Vietnam, in China during Tiananmen Square, and as Central Command Director of Intelligence during Desert Shield and Desert Storm make it a valuable read. He also kindly joined us for a <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/professional-courage-telling-it-like-it-is\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief Cover Stories podcast</a> where he told us about the challenges of telling a demanding boss what they need to know rather than what they want to hear.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

The drinking water system, it said, was polluted with a contaminant commonly known as GenX, part of the family of \u201cforever\u201d PFAS chemicals.</p>\n\n<p>It came from a Chemours plant in Fayetteville, near the winding Cape Fear River. Few knew about the contaminated water until the article described the discoveries of scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency and a state university. Given that certain types of PFAS have been linked to cancer, there was widespread anxiety over its potential danger.</p>\n\n<p>In the onslaught of legal action and activism that followed, the EPA during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term took an assertive stance, vowing to combat the spread of PFAS nationwide.</p>\n\n<p>In its big-picture <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/documents/pfas_action_plan_021319_508compliant_1.pdf\">PFAS action plan</a> from 2019, the agency said it would attack this complex problem on multiple fronts. It would, for example, consider limiting the presence of two of the best-known compounds \u2014 PFOA and PFOS \u2014 in drinking water. And, it said, it would find out more about the potential harm of GenX, which was virtually unregulated.</p>\n\n<p>By the time Trump was sworn in for his second term, many of the plan\u2019s suggestions had been put in place. After his first administration said <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-proposed-decision-regulate-pfoa-and-pfos-drinking-water\">PFOA and PFOS in drinking water should be regulated</a>, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-first-ever-national-drinking-water-standard\">standards were finalized</a> under President Joe Biden. Four other types of PFAS, including GenX, were also tagged with limits.</p>\n\n<p>But now, the second Trump administration is pulling back. The EPA said in May that it will <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-it-will-keep-maximum-contaminant-levels-pfoa-pfos\">delay enforcement on  the drinking water limits </a>for PFOA and PFOS until 2031, and it will rescind and reconsider the limits on the other four. Among those who challenged the standards in court is Chemours, which has argued that the EPA, under Biden, \u201cused flawed science and didn\u2019t follow proper rulemaking procedures\u201d for GenX.</p>\n\n<p>These EPA decisions under Trump are part of a slew of delays and course changes to PFAS policies that had been supported in his first term. Even though his earlier EPA pursued a measure that would help hold polluters accountable for cleaning up PFAS, the EPA of his second term has not yet committed to it. The agency also slowed down a process for finding out how industries have used the chemicals, a step prompted by a law signed by Trump in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the EPA is hampering its ability to research pollutants \u2014 the kind of research that made it possible for its own scientists to investigate GenX. As the Trump administration seeks severe reductions in the EPA\u2019s budget, the agency has terminated grants for PFAS studies and paralyzed its scientists with spending restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>Pointing to <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-zeldin-announces-major-epa-actions-combat-pfas-contamination\">earlier announcements</a> on its <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-it-will-keep-maximum-contaminant-levels-pfoa-pfos\">approach to the chemicals</a>, the EPA told ProPublica that it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to addressing PFAS in drinking water and ensuring that regulations issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act follow the law, follow the science, and can be implemented by water systems to strengthen public health protections.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf anything,\u201d the agency added, \u201cthe Trump administration\u2019s historic PFAS plan in 2019 laid the groundwork for the first steps to comprehensively address this contamination across media and we will continue to do so this term.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In public appearances, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has pushed back on the suggestion that his agency weakened the drinking water limits on GenX and similar compounds. Future regulations imposed by his agency, he said, could be more or less stringent. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat we want to do is follow the science, period,\u201d he has said.</p>\n\n<p>That sentiment perplexes scientists and environmental advocates, who say there is already persuasive evidence on the dangers of these chemicals that linger in the environment. <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/human-health-toxicity-assessments-genx-chemicals\">The EPA reviewed GenX</a>, for example, during both the first Trump and Biden administrations. In both 2018 and 2021, the agency pointed to animal studies linking it to cancer, as well as problems with kidneys, immune systems and, especially, livers. (Chemours has argued that certain animal studies have limited relevance to humans.)</p>\n\n<p>Scientists and advocates also said it\u2019s unclear what it means for the EPA to follow the science while diminishing its own ability to conduct research.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why we would want to hamstring the agency that is designed to make sure we have clean air and clean water,\u201d said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist in Oregon who worked with other scientists on Cape Fear River research. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            The Cape Fear River runs near the Chemours plant in Fayetteville, North Carolina.\n    \n            (Ed Kashi/The New York Times/Redux Images)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \nDelays, Confusion Over PFAS\n<p>Favored for their nonstick and liquid-resistant qualities, synthetic PFAS chemicals are widely used in products like raincoats, cookware and fast food wrappers. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/3m-forever-chemicals-pfas-pfos-inside-story\">Manufacturers made the chemicals for decades without disclosing</a> how certain types are toxic at extremely low levels, can accumulate in the body and will scarcely break down over time \u2014 hence the nickname \u201cforever chemicals.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The chemicals persist in soil and water too, making them complicated and costly to clean up, leading to a yearslong push to get such sites covered by the EPA\u2019s Superfund program, which is designed to handle toxic swaths of land. During the first Trump administration, the EPA said it was taking steps toward designating the two legacy compounds, PFOA and PFOS, as \u201chazardous substances\u201d under the Superfund program. Its liability provisions would help hold polluters responsible for the cost of cleaning up.</p>\n\n<p>Moving forward with this designation process was a priority, according to the PFAS plan from Trump\u2019s first term. Zeldin\u2019s EPA <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-zeldin-announces-major-epa-actions-combat-pfas-contamination\">describes that plan as \u201chistoric.</a>\u201d And, when he represented a Long Island district with PFAS problems in Congress, Zeldin <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2467\">voted for a bill</a> that would have directed the EPA to take this step.  </p>\n\n<p>The designation became official under Biden. But business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and organizations representing the construction, recycling and chemical industries, sued. Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation\u2019s playbook for the new administration, also questioned it.</p>\n\n<p>Zeldin has said repeatedly that he wants to hold polluters accountable for PFAS, but his EPA requested three delays in the court case challenging the Superfund designation that helps make it possible.</p>\n\n<p>The agency said in a recent motion it needed the latest pause because new leadership is still reviewing the issues and evaluating the designation in context of its \u201ccomprehensive strategy to address PFOA and PFOS.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The EPA also <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/05/13/2025-08168/perfluoroalkyl-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas-data-reporting-and-recordkeeping-under-the-toxic\">delayed a rule</a> requiring manufacturers and importers to report details about their PFAS use between 2011 and 2022. An annual bill that sets defense policy and spending, signed by Trump in his first term, had charged the EPA with developing such a process. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-finalizes-rule-require-reporting-pfas-data-better-protect-communities-forever\">When Biden\u2019s EPA finalized it</a>, the agency said the rule would provide the largest-ever dataset of PFAS manufactured and used in the United States. It would help authorities understand their spread and determine what protections might be warranted. </p>\n\n<p>Businesses were supposed to start reporting this month. But in a May 2 letter, a coalition of chemical companies <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2025-05/tsca-sec.-21-petition-reporting-and-recordkeeping-requirements-for-certain-per-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas-may-2025_0.pdf\">petitioned the EPA to withdraw the deadline</a>, reconsider the rule and issue a revised one with narrowed scope. </p>\n\n<p>When the EPA delayed the rule less than two weeks later, it said it needed time to prepare for data collection and to consider changes to aspects of the rule.</p>\n\n<p>In an email to ProPublica, the agency said it will address PFAS in many ways. Its approach, the agency said, is to give more time for compliance and to work with water systems to reduce PFAS exposure as quickly as feasible, \u201crather than issue violations and collect fees that don\u2019t benefit public health.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The court expects an update from the EPA in the Superfund designation case by Wednesday, and in the legal challenges to the drinking water standards by July 21. The EPA could continue defending the rules. It could ask the court for permission to reverse its position or to send the rules back to the agency for reconsideration. Or it could also ask for further pauses. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a big unanswered question whether this administration and this EPA is going to be serious about enforcing anything,\u201d said Robert Sussman, a former EPA official from the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. As a lawyer, he now represents environmental groups that filed an amicus brief in PFAS cases.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Back in North Carolina, problems caused by the chemicals continue to play out.</p>\n\n<p>A consent order between the state and Chemours required the manufacturer to drastically reduce the release of GenX and other PFAS into the environment. (The chemicals commonly called GenX refer to HFPO-DA and its ammonium salt, which are involved in the GenX processing aid technology owned by Chemours.)</p>\n\n<p>Chemours told ProPublica that it invested more than $400 million to remediate and reduce PFAS emissions. It also noted that there are hundreds of PFAS users in North Carolina, \u201cas evidenced by PFAS seen upstream and hundreds of miles away\u201d from its Fayetteville plant \u201cthat cannot be traced back to the site.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>PFAS-riddled sea foam continues to wash up on the coastal beaches. Chemours and water utilities, meanwhile, are battling in court about who should cover the cost of upgrades to remove the chemicals from drinking water.</p>\n\n<p>Community forums about PFAS draw triple-digit crowds, even when they\u2019re held on a weeknight, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the volunteer group Clean Cape Fear, which has intervened in federal litigation. In the fast-growing region, new residents are just learning about the chemicals, she said, and they\u2019re angry.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI feel like we\u2019re walking backwards,\u201d Donovan said. Pulling back from the drinking water standards, in particular, is \u201cdisrespectful to this community.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say you\u2019re going to focus on PFAS,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing to never let it cross the finish line and become any meaningful regulation.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n\n            A letter dated April 29, 2025, notifying Michigan State University about the termination of a grant for research into PFAS, one day after the EPA said in a press release that it was committed to combating PFAS contamination by, in part, \u201cstrengthening the science.\u201d\n    \n            (Obtained by ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n            \n                    \n    \n                    \nResearch Under Fire\n<p>The EPA of Trump\u2019s first term didn\u2019t just call for more regulation of PFAS, it also stressed the importance of better understanding the forever chemicals through research and testing. </p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-01/documents/pfas_action_plan_feb2020.pdf\">2020 update</a> to its PFAS action plan, the EPA highlighted its support for North Carolina\u2019s investigation of GenX in the Cape Fear River. And it described its efforts to develop the science on PFAS issues affecting rural economies with \u201cfirst-of-its-kind funding for the agriculture sector.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Zeldin, too, has boasted about advancing PFAS research in an <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-zeldin-announces-major-epa-actions-combat-pfas-contamination\">April news release</a>. \u201cThis is just a start of the work we will do on PFAS to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>At about the same time, though, the agency terminated a host of congressionally appropriated grants for PFAS research, including over $15 million for <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-awards-15-million-research-pfas-exposure-and-reduction-agriculture\">projects focused on food and farmlands</a> in places like Utah, Texas and Illinois.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists at Michigan State University, for example, were investigating how PFAS interacts with water, soil, crops, livestock and biosolids, which are used for fertilizer. They timed their latest study to this year\u2019s growing season, hired staff and partnered with a farm. Then the EPA canceled two grants.</p>\n\n<p>In virtually identical letters, the agency said that each grant \u201cno longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The contrast between the agency\u2019s words and actions raises questions about the process behind its decisions, said Cheryl Murphy, head of Michigan State\u2019s Center for PFAS Research and co-lead of one of the projects.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you halt it right now,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re undermining our ability to translate the science that we\u2019re developing into some policy and guidance to help people minimize their exposure to PFAS.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>At least some of the researchers are appealing the terminations.</p>\n\n<p>About a month after PFAS grants to research teams in Maine and Virginia were terminated for not being aligned with agency priorities, the agency reinstated them. The EPA told ProPublica that \u201cthere will be more updates on research-related grants in the future.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Even if the Michigan State grants are reinstated, there could be lasting consequences, said Hui Li, the soil scientist who led both projects. \u201cWe will miss the season for this year,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cand could lose the livestock on the farm for the research.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Federal researchers are also in limbo. Uncertainty, lost capacity and spending restrictions have stunted the work at an EPA lab in Duluth, Minnesota, that investigates PFAS and other potential hazards, according to several sources connected to it. As one source who works at the lab put it, \u201cWe don\u2019t know how much longer we will be operating as is.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The EPA told ProPublica that it\u2019s \u201ccontinuing to invest in research and labs, including Duluth, to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the agency is asking Congress to eliminate more than half of its own budget. That includes massive staffing cuts, and it would slash nearly all the money for two major programs that help states fund water and wastewater infrastructure. One dates back to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration. The other was <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-03/documents/pfas_fact_sheet_and_case_studies_final.pdf\">spotlighted in a paper by Trump\u2019s first-term EPA</a>, which said communities could use these funds to protect public health from PFAS. It trumpeted examples from places like Michigan and New Jersey.</p>\n\n<p>The EPA lost 727 employees in voluntary separations between Jan. 1 and late June, according to numbers the agency provided to ProPublica. It said it received more than 2,600 applications for the second round of deferred resignations and voluntary early retirements.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese are really technical, difficult jobs,\u201d said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. \u201cAnd the EPA, by encouraging so many employees to leave, is also losing a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of technical expertise.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The shake-up also worries DeWitt, who was one of the scientists who helped investigate the Cape Fear River contamination and who has served on an EPA science advisory board. Her voice shook as she reflected on the EPA\u2019s workforce, \u201csome of the finest scientists I know,\u201d and what their loss means for public well-being.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTaking away this talent from our federal sector,\u201d she said, will have \u201cprofound effects on the agency\u2019s ability to protect people in the United States from hazardous chemicals in air, in water, in soil and potentially in food.\u201d</p>",

That year, <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=83R&amp;Bill=HB3351\">the bill he wanted</a> to pass died.</p>\n\n<p>More than a decade later, however, Musk\u2019s fortunes inside the Texas Capitol have changed \u2014 dramatically. </p>\n\n<p>Musk is now not only one of the richest people in the world, who, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/05/nx-s1-5424686/donald-trump-elon-musk-bromance-breakup\">until recently</a>, was a key member of <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/tags/donald-trump\">President Donald Trump</a>\u2019s second administration, but he\u2019s also become one of the most powerful business and political figures in the state. </p>\n\n<p>During this year\u2019s legislative session, Musk\u2019s lobbyists and representatives publicly advocated for almost a dozen bills that would benefit his companies. The Texas Newsroom identified these priorities by searching legislative records for committee testimony and other evidence of his public stances.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Musk wanted legislators to pass new laws that would make it faster and easier for homeowners to <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB1202\">install backup power generators</a>, like the <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/powerwall\">kind Tesla makes</a>, on their properties. He wanted them to create new crimes so people who fly drones or interfere with operations at his rocket company <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/tags/spacex\">SpaceX</a> can be arrested. And he wanted to change who controlled the highway and <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-04-11/elon-musk-texas-starbase-spacex-launch-election-boca-chica-beach\">public beach near SpaceX</a>\u2019s South Texas site so he can launch his rockets according to his timeline. </p>\n\n<p>Musk got them all.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>In a Capitol where the vast majority of bills fail to pass, all but three of Musk\u2019s public priorities will become law. The two bills his lobbyists openly opposed are dead, including a measure that would have regulated autonomous vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Musk made gains even on bills he didn\u2019t publicly endorse. Texas lawmakers followed the tech giant\u2019s lead by <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB29\">rewriting the state\u2019s corporate laws</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-04-23/texas-creates-its-own-doge-to-make-the-state-more-business-friendly\">creating a new office</a> modeled after the Department of Government Efficiency, the controversial effort he led in the Trump administration to cut federal spending.</p>\n\n<p>By all accounts, Musk\u2019s influence was great enough that he did not have to formally address lawmakers in person this session to make the case for any of his priorities.</p>\n\n<p>Critics said these new laws will hand Musk\u2019s companies more cash, more power and more protection from scrutiny as <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/austin/2025-02-12/elon-musk-doge-texas-business-x-spacex-boring-snailbrook-grow-expand\">his business footprint continues to expand</a> across Texas. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe real harm is the influence of a private company on the decisions made by government,\u201d Cyrus Reed, the conservation director for the Sierra Club\u2019s Lone Star Chapter, told The Texas Newsroom. The Sierra Club is part of a group suing the state over SpaceX\u2019s activities in South Texas. </p>\n\n<p>Musk and his representatives did not respond to requests for an interview. He <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/30/nx-s1-5415641/musk-leaves-doge-what-comes-next\">recently ended his run with DOGE</a>, and his  relationship with <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/05/nx-s1-5424686/donald-trump-elon-musk-bromance-breakup\">Trump has increasingly frayed</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Contrary to his slash-and-burn tactics in Washington, D.C., where he bulldozed his way onto the scene after Trump\u2019s reelection, Musk has played the long game to amass power in Texas. He still hasn\u2019t succeeded in changing Texas law to allow for Tesla direct sales, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from steadily investing his personal and professional capital in the state over more than a decade. Most of his businesses, including the tunneling firm The Boring Company, <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/tags/twitter\">social media giant X</a> and Tesla, <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/austin/2025-02-12/elon-musk-doge-texas-business-x-spacex-boring-snailbrook-grow-expand\">are now headquartered here</a>. While it\u2019s still based in California, SpaceX operates <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/austin/2025-02-12/elon-musk-doge-texas-business-x-spacex-boring-snailbrook-grow-expand\">production</a>, <a href=\"https://www.expressnews.com/business/article/spacex-expanding-waco-rocket-engine-starbase-19925816.php\">testing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/energy-environment/2025-05-06/spacex-starbase-starship-launch-texas-faa-environment-approval\">launch</a> sites across Texas. </p>\n\n<p>Musk has also moved his personal home to the state, reportedly securing properties in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/technology/elon-musk-texas-neighbors.html\">the Austin area</a> and <a href=\"https://observer.com/2023/08/elon-musk-boca-chica-home-photo/\">South Texas</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the Texas Capitol, Musk\u2019s power is subtle but undeniable. </p>\n\n<p>Calendars and emails obtained by The Texas Newsroom through public information requests show his company\u2019s representatives met regularly with lawmakers backing his priority bills and invited Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick to tour SpaceX. Patrick, who leads the state Senate, also penned a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration supporting the rocket company\u2019s request to increase its launches in South Texas.</p>\n\n<p>Texas politics, with its long history of outsize characters, has never seen the likes of Musk, said Rice University political scientist Mark Jones. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cEven in the heyday of the [George W.] Bush era, you couldn\u2019t find somebody who had such dramatic wealth as Musk, who also had the same level of access and business interests here in Texas,\u201d Jones told The Texas Newsroom. \u201cToday, Elon Musk is arguably the most powerful and influential private citizen in the country.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            A mural of Elon Musk in downtown Brownsville, Texas\n    \n            (Michael Gonzalez for KUT News)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n\u201cIt\u2019s All to Help Elon\u201d\n<p>When lawmakers convened their 2025 legislative session in January, one of Musk\u2019s top priorities was quickly clear. He wanted more control over the <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-04-11/elon-musk-texas-starbase-spacex-launch-election-boca-chica-beach\">area around SpaceX\u2019s launch site</a> in South Texas.</p>\n\n<p>Known as Starbase, the massive rocket testing and launch facility has come to dominate the small rural area between Brownsville, on the border, and the Gulf of Mexico. It is the launch site for <a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/\">Starship</a>, the rocket meant to eventually take humans to Mars and the heart of Musk\u2019s mission to make humans a multiplanetary species. The FAA recently gave SpaceX permission to <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/energy-environment/2025-05-06/spacex-starbase-starship-launch-texas-faa-environment-approval\">increase Starship launches fivefold</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Although SpaceX owns most of the land around Starbase, county officials retained the authority over access to the adjacent public beach, called Boca Chica. The county worked closely with SpaceX to ensure the area was cleared ahead of launches, but the company\u2019s leaders did not have ultimate control over the process.   </p>\n\n<p>That changed this year. First, Musk <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-04-11/elon-musk-texas-starbase-spacex-launch-election-boca-chica-beach\">decided to incorporate</a> the launch site as its own city. That happened on May 3, when the few residents who live in the area \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-05-01/elon-musk-spacex-starbase-city-texas-election-vote-voters-employees\">most of whom The Texas Newsroom determined work for SpaceX</a> \u2014 voted to <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-05-03/elon-musk-texas-spacex-city-starbase-vote-election-results\">create the new city of Starbase</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Musk then wanted state lawmakers to hand the new city the power to close Boca Chica Beach and the adjoining public highway during the week, a change the county officials opposed.</p>\n\n<p>State Sen. Adam Hinojosa, a newly elected Republican who represents the area, authored the legislation to shift control to Starbase. Dozens of SpaceX employees got involved in the effort, submitting <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/publiccomments/billhistory/HB04660H.pdf\">pages of identical comments</a> to lawmakers in support. </p>\n\n<p>Democrats succeeded in killing Hinojosa\u2019s bill, prompting local <a href=\"https://myrgv.com/publications/the-monitor/2025/04/28/spacex-legislation-dies-would-have-removed-countys-authority-on-closures/#google_vignette\">activists to celebrate</a>. Their victory was short-lived. Late in the session, lawmakers decided instead to shift some of this power to the Texas Space Commission, which facilitates the state\u2019s space exploration agenda.</p>\n\n<p>The new law states that the commission\u2019s board can close highways and gulf beaches with the approval of a local municipality, which, in this case, is Starbase. SpaceX retains a connection to the commission itself: Kathy Lueders, who confirmed that she left her job as Starbase general manager last month, still sits on the Space Commission board. She directed additional questions to the commission. </p>\n\n<p>The Space Commission declined to answer questions on SpaceX\u2019s potential future involvement with these discussions.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe way I view it is SpaceX wanted a certain amount of power,\u201d said Reed, with the Sierra Club. \u201cAnd at the end of the day, they didn\u2019t quite get it, but they got something pretty close.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB5246\">bill</a> passed along largely partisan lines. Republican state Rep. Greg Bonnen, who authored the bill, did not respond to a request for comment about the role Starbase may play now that it will become law. </p>\n\n<p>Lawmakers passed several more bills to benefit spaceports, the sites where spacecraft launch, like SpaceX. </p>\n\n<p>While Texas is home to multiple spaceports, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin, SpaceX dwarfs the rest in size and scope of influence across the state and country, boasting large federal government contracts and a growing satellite industry.</p>\n\n<p>Hinojosa was an author or sponsor on most of these bills; he did not respond to multiple requests for an interview or comment for this story.</p>\n\n<p>Other than the beach closure legislation, many passed with the support of Democrats.</p>\n\n<p>At SpaceX\u2019s urging, Texas lawmakers passed a measure to <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB1197\">ban drones over spaceports</a>. They also added spaceports to the <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB1198\">state\u2019s \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d facilities</a>, which already include airports and military bases. The law will make it a felony to intentionally damage or interrupt the operation of any site where a spacecraft is tested or launched. Similar critical infrastructure laws have been used in other states <a href=\"https://www.icnl.org/wp-content/uploads/CI-Bill-Briefer-final-formatted.pdf\">to arrest people protesting</a> oil and gas pipeline projects.</p>\n\n<p>Bekah Hinojosa with the South Texas Environmental Justice Network, a local activist group, told The Texas Newsroom the new critical infrastructure law will let Musk \u201cmilitarize our Boca Chica Beach for his dangerous rocket testing endeavors.\" </p>\n\n<p>The Sierra Club and other groups from South Texas, including a local Indigenous tribe, are suing the state, arguing that closing Boca Chica violates an amendment to the Texas Constitution that <a href=\"https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CN/htm/CN.1/CN.1.33.htm\">protects access to public beaches</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The General Land Office, the main defendant in that suit, declined to comment. In court filings, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argues the state can still regulate beach access for public safety reasons and that it cannot be sued in this case because it has immunity. The case is pending at the Texas Supreme Court.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            A rally at Boca Chica Beach against the incorporation of Starbase on May 3\n    \n            (Michael Gonzalez for KUT News)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Legislators also passed two more new laws that will shield companies like SpaceX from <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB1706\">public scrutiny</a> and <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB4157\">legal challenges</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB1706\">One</a> will exempt certain military and aerospace issues from public meetings laws, allowing elected officials in some cases to discuss these topics behind closed doors. The proposal was so concerning to residents who live close to SpaceX\u2019s facility near Waco, where locals say the company\u2019s rocket testing has <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna52976191\">spooked livestock</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kwtx.com/2024/05/02/waco-man-suing-spacex-alleges-rocket-engine-testing-vibrations-damaged-his-home/\">damaged homes</a>, that they <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/publiccomments/billhistory/HB02679H.pdf\">submitted</a> a dozen comments against it.  </p>\n\n<p>This law went into effect on May 15.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB4157\">Another</a> new law will make it harder for crew members and certain other employees to sue space flight companies. This, like most new legislation approved this session, will become law on Sept. 1.</p>\n\n<p>SpaceX\u2019s only significant public defeat during this year\u2019s legislative session was the failure of a bill it supported to give spaceports a <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB3045\">tax cut</a>. The measure would have <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/fiscalnotes/html/HB03045H.htm\">cost nearly $14.5 million</a> over five years, according to an official estimate from the Legislative Budget Board. </p>\n\n<p>Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin, believes Texas is pandering to Musk. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all to help Elon,\u201d said Jah, who added that his viewpoint is rooted in resisting policies that enable what he called \u201cenvironmental plunder masked as \u2018innovation.\u2019\u201d He has concerns that the state is investing in spaceports, most notably Musk\u2019s, while carving out exceptions that prohibit public insight and input into what\u2019s happening at those facilities.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s this whole cloak of secrecy with whatever Elon is doing,\u201d Jah said. \u201cWe will not and should not cease to launch satellites or explore space. But the way in which we do it matters a lot.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\u201cThey Never Come Out of the Shadows\u201d\n<p>This year, Tesla\u2019s lobbyists publicly advocated against only two bills. Both died. </p>\n\n<p>One was a GOP-authored <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB1378\">proposal</a> intended to create a buffer zone between homes and large-scale energy storage facilities <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/megapack\">like the kind Tesla sells</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB3837\">The other bill</a> would have imposed more regulations on the type of cars that <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/transportation/2025-05-21/elon-musk-says-teslas-autonomous-taxis-will-be-on-austin-streets-next-month\">Musk is rolling out as robotaxis in Texas</a>, and would have required a public hearing if a collision involving an autonomous vehicle resulted in a fatality.</p>\n\n<p>Bill author Rep. Terry Canales, an Edinburg Democrat, believes his legislation failed because it was not pro-industry enough. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cTesla is the worst actor that I\u2019ve ever dealt with in the Capitol. They\u2019re subversive. They never come out of the shadows,\u201d Canales told The Texas Newsroom. \u201cNot only did I not hear from them, I didn\u2019t expect to hear from them because that\u2019s the way they operate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Lawmakers instead advanced <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB2425\">a different bill</a>, one with a lighter regulatory touch that was crafted with input from the autonomous vehicle industry. </p>\n\n<p>It will require commercial operators, such as robotaxi and driverless big rig companies, to obtain authorization from the state. This approval can be revoked if the company\u2019s vehicles endanger the public, including causing \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d though it requires no public hearings in the case of a fatality, as Canales\u2019 bill would have done. Autonomous vehicle companies will also have to develop plans for interacting with emergency responders. </p>\n\n<p>Tesla took a neutral stance on the legislation. But the bill\u2019s author, state Sen. Robert Nichols, R-Jacksonville, told The Texas Newsroom that Tesla\u2019s team participated in work groups and stakeholder conversations with industry groups, trial lawyers and others. </p>\n\n<p>Texas has been at the forefront of testing this technology for years, rolling out its first regulations in 2017. But with more autonomous vehicles hitting the streets, Nichols said it was time to clarify the rules and called his bill \u201ca real opportunity here to actually improve safety.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Nichols\u2019 legislation initially died in the Texas House. But with less than a week before lawmakers packed up to go home, a House member added the entirety of Nichols\u2019 bill as an amendment to <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB2807\">another transportation bill</a>, which will become law Sept. 1.</p>\n\n<p>Tray Gober, a personal injury lawyer who handles vehicle crash cases in Austin, said it\u2019s smart to get new regulations for autonomous vehicles on the books. But he worries that Texas is rushing to give its blessing to a technology that has not been fully tested. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about rockets crashing into the ocean. We\u2019re talking about cars crashing into other people,\u201d he said, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413240/elon-musk-starship-rocket-launch-spacex\">comparing Tesla to SpaceX</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be people that are hurt during this process of improving these systems, and that\u2019s unfortunate. I think it\u2019s viewed as collateral damage by these companies.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When asked about concerns that there could be fatalities as the number of driverless cars grows in Texas, Nichols said, \u201cThere probably will be. Eventually there will be. I would not doubt that.\u201d But he pointed to studies showing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/411522/self-driving-car-artificial-intelligence-autonomous-vehicle-safety-waymo-google\">autonomous vehicles are safer</a> than human drivers. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you start looking at the breakdown of the fatalities on the roads and the crashes and the wrecks, what causes them? It\u2019s not equipment failure. It\u2019s driver distraction,\u201d he told The Texas Newsroom. </p>\n\n<p>Critics of these studies argue their scope is too narrow to make conclusions about the safety of self-driving technology. Citing safety concerns, some local lawmakers asked Tesla\u2019s robotaxi rollout in Austin to <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/transportation/2025-06-20/austin-texas-tesla-self-driving-robotaxi-launch-elon-musk\">be delayed. The company continued with the launch but</a> with <a href=\"https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2025/06/22/tesla-robotaxis-begin-rolling-in-austin-but-only-for-a-select-few/84308887007/\">human monitors</a> in the passenger seats. </p>\n\n<p>Many Democrats opposed Nichols\u2019 proposal. But at least three other bills affecting Tesla got bipartisan support. </p>\n\n<p>At times, the Sierra Club was fighting against Musk\u2019s SpaceX bills while working with his Tesla lobbyists on clean energy legislation, said Reed, the club\u2019s conservation director. For example, Tesla and the Sierra Club both supported legislation to create <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB3824\">new fire standards</a> for battery energy storage facilities and address the environmental and financial challenges associated with <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB3809\">decommissioning them</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Tesla also backed a bill that had bipartisan support to make it easier for homeowners to install backup power generators, such as the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/powerwall\">Powerwall</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Reed said Musk\u2019s shift to the right has created interesting bedfellows, sometimes making it easier for Republicans to back some of the energy policies more traditionally associated with progressives. </p>\n\n<p>He remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting time in our country, right?\u201d</p>\n\nMusk\u2019s Indirect Influence\n</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            A Tesla showroom in Austin on March 24\n    \n            (Michael Minasi/KUT News)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>For all the bills Musk pushed to see pass, he also indirectly influenced the creation of new laws on which he did not take a public stance.</p>\n\n<p>Texas lawmakers created the <a href=\"https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-signs-texas-doge-into-law-at-texas-capitol\">state\u2019s own DOGE office</a> housed under the governor, the name an homage to Musk\u2019s controversial federal cost-slashing effort in Washington, D.C. </p>\n\n<p>Musk himself took no public role in creating the new office. But at a signing ceremony for the bill, Gov.

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION</strong> \u2013 On January 27, 2025, President Trump signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/the-iron-dome-for-america/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Executive Order</a> aimed at defending the U.S. against an attack by ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles as well as other advanced aerial attacks; the Golden Dome initiative. The Pentagon moved out smartly to fulfill this order. Industry lined up with ideas on how to defend the U.S. and Department of Defense bureaucrats convened and developed a strategy. All the work that has happened is needed. But we need more.</p><p>We need to build the technology to support defensive systems to secure the homeland from adversary advanced aerial attacks. But we are missing a crucial part of the equation which could be happening now with only limited additional resources.</p><p>The U.S. needs to be moving out diligently to put in place the best collection capability to provide early warning regarding U.S. adversaries. Too often, the U.S. jumps to a solution and forgets that we must start with intelligence to put the building blocks in place to address the solution.</p><p>In this case, the Executive Order asks for a study of adversary threat but that is all. There is nothing about developing intelligence for early warning on adversary intent. This is an important oversight. The U.S. must focus on developing warning that lets decisionmakers know when our adversaries are planning a launch. The important satellite tracking mechanisms that will follow the launches should only be used if the intelligence community misses the early warning.</p><p>To ensure the U.S. is using its resources to its best ability in building the Golden Dome, the entire intelligence infrastructure of collection, technology to support the collection, and ability to exploit the collection - to include analytical experts - must be synergized to provide early warning that an adversary is considering an aerial attack.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Upgrade your access to exclusive content by <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\">becoming a subscriber</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>The literature regarding golden dome focuses on interception and tracking missiles once they are launched. There is a lot of discussion about the need for a defensive system. All of this is warranted, and it is the area where the most money needs to be spent. However, the literature is much less focused on what the U.S. needs to put in place prior to launch to buy time for developing options to counter an attack and limit the risk regarding that decision making process.</p><p>Without the platforms that can collect on adversary intent, capability, movement, and other anomalies, decisionmakers could be left with rushed choices on the use of defensive systems that could result in catastrophic consequences if the technology detects missiles too late or misreads that aerial attacks are coming our way when they may not be.</p><p>Time is the important variable for decision makers. The earlier the intelligence community can present them with analysis and reporting of adversary intent, the better and likely less risky the consequences are for the US.</p><p>For example, if the Intelligence Community (IC) can provide the President with information that an adversary has given an order to prepare an aerial attack against the U.S. - while the attack is being planned but prior to launch - then there are more options to stop that attack.</p><p>The IC is then alerted to track adversary movements so that decisionmakers know how much time they have to decide on an option and which option will work best under the circumstances. In this scenario, U.S. decision makers have days instead of hours, to plan. This allows for a wide range of options to stop a launch - from diplomacy, to sanctions, to military action.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>The current Golden Dome literature talks a lot about tracking these aerial devices and calls for a new look at radars, both space and ground based. As I stated, a reliance on this architecture risks being too late in the decision cycle. Kudos to the Army for recognizing the need for <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/land/2025/03/28/army-looks-to-artificial-intelligence-to-enhance-future-golden-dome/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">smart warning</a> by integrating artificial intelligence into their Integrated Battle Command system, but even this initiative does not hit the early warning collection issue head on.</p><p>LTG Gainey, commanding general of the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) hinted at the issue during a House Armed Services <a href=\"https://armedservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ltg_gainey.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">subcommittee hearing</a> in April when he said the Golden Dome also includes left-of-launch operations, providing deny, delay, disrupt and degrade missile defeat effects in coordination with global combatant commands, the Intelligence Community, Joint Staff, interagency, and Office of the Secretary of Defense. This still does not highlight the need for early warning.</p><p>The U.S. can detect missile launches with its existing Space-Based Infrared System satellites in geosynchronous orbit. These satellites can tell where a ballistic missile is going and where its warheads are likely to fall, but the United States wants to develop better warning and tracking by creating a Custody Layer \u2014 satellites that will watch where all the other guy\u2019s stuff is \u2014 and a Tracking Layer that could also determine where more sophisticated weapons, like hypersonic missiles, are headed.</p><p>Fred Kennedy, the inaugural director of the U.S. Space Development Agency and a former director of DARPA\u2019s Tactical Technology Office, shares in <em><a href=\"https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/golden-dome-analysis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Aerospace America</a></em>, his vision of a Custody Layer: \"a constellation that would be equipped with moving target indicator radar, imaging radar and other sensors, to keep tabs on an adversary\u2019s offensive 'internet of things.' \u2026..These satellites would be the equivalent of Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System and U-2 aircraft, but in space. To strike a missile, you have to know where it could be launched from, after all. Complementing the Custody Layer was the Tracking Layer, the satellites that would detect and track hypersonic or ballistic weapons after launch.\"</p><p>This is all important work and needed but note, it is all focused on launch.</p><p>If decisionmakers are being told by the space-based interceptors that attacks are on the way\u2014there is only one option, to intercept. But what if those interceptors misread the information or what if they did not read the tracking in time? In either scenario it could be the beginning of a catastrophic event that is based on a mistake.</p><p>For that reason, we need to start with the intelligence and put as much effort into that as we are on the interceptors. Collaboration with the Pentagon and other agencies that track satellite imagery is key. I would also add that the Defense Intelligence Agency needs to play a primary role in this initiative which must include increased human intelligence and all forms of open source to include commercial data.</p><p>With the intelligence community and department of defense getting smaller, we need to work together more than ever. Defending our nation is a team sport that requires strong intelligence to set up decision makers and operators to make the best decisions possible, helping to mitigate risk. This cannot happen without the defense and intelligence communities working together to provide the first warning\u2014way before launch. Now is the time to push the intelligence community to upgrade technologies that track missiles by providing warning of aberrations in patterns before launch.</p><p>By using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to synthesize critical technical collection with anomalies in open source (OSINT), commercial (CAI), and personal (PAI) data, we could have the cultural breakthrough we need to change how the intelligence community uses technical collection fused with OSINT, CAI, PAI and AI. Against this national security backdrop, we could have our first big win in changing how we process intelligence and safeguard the US. NGA\u2019s Maven program is a big step in the right direction of fusing intelligence to support DoD and the rest of the national security establishment. This practice needs to be more widespread.</p><p>Now is the time to use proven technology with expert analysis to provide decision makers increased time and space to counter aerial attacks on the homeland. The resources involved, compared to the amount needed for satellites and lasers to shoot down the missiles, is minimal. This action can be started now, the technology exists. Putting in place early warning buys time for the US to develop the rest of the Golden Dome security.</p><p><em><strong>Who\u2019s Reading this?

NATO also put on a show of unity and recommitted to collective defense. </em></em></p><p><em><em>The Cipher Brief spoke with Lieutenant General Ben Hodges (Ret.), who served as commanding general, U.S. Army Europe, about what the alliance has to do post-summit to ready defenses for a \u201cfight tonight\u201d posture. </em></em></p><p><em><em>Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

I was struck by how effusive, really, President Trump was in his praise of what happened at The Hague and very clear in his commitments. What's your take on how that all played out?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>I think I\u2019m more relieved than surprised. I'm biased because I\u2019ve been a NATO officer my whole Army life, as all Army officers are part of the Alliance. I recognize its importance for America's strategic interests. I'm glad that the president did what he did. There was a huge sigh of relief in the Hague that he even showed up. There was some anxiety about that, or that he might blow it up somehow. So the best outcome did happen. He was there. He stayed for the entire thing. He met with President Zelensky. We got an agreement on 5% across the alliance, with one exception, and then a public affirmation of American commitment to the alliance by the president. That's pretty good.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>You\u2019re referring to Article 5 of the NATO charter, which says an attack on any member must be met by all other members. There\u2019s been a kind of rallying cry among some Trump supporters that the idea that American soldiers would fight for Estonia, for example, that\u2019s never gonna happen \u2014 that's not America first. Talk a bit about the significance of that specific commitment, because it seems to put to rest what's been said before on that front.</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which created NATO, says an armed attack on one shall be considered an armed attack on all. That commitment to collective security has been the glue that held the alliance together. The Soviet Union for decades, now Russia and other adversaries, see this commitment of now 32 nations that if one is attacked, all the other nations would consider it an armed attack on themselves. That was such a powerful part of the deterrence when it's backed up by real credible capabilities. </p><p>For the first time in my life, in his last administration, the president called that into question. I was horrified. That sort of opens a door to a terrible miscalculation by Moscow that maybe the U.S. would not be so committed. Then the Russians could achieve what has always been their dream, which is to break the alliance, to see that members would not respond, and also to continue driving a wedge between Europe and North America. So it was important that the president affirmed it very strongly, clearly and publicly. </p><p>Now, some people ask why would we have American soldiers dying for Estonia? It's an absolutely ridiculous assertion because that is people not understanding why the alliance is so important for us. By the way, this Article 5 has only been invoked once in the almost 80 years of history of NATO, and that was after 9/11, when you had Estonians who came and died because of the United States. </p><p>Our economic interests are tied to a very prosperous Europe, so we need Europe to be stable and secure and prosperous because it affects our economy. Secondly, the access that we have in Europe from the UK all the way to Turkey and everywhere in between enables us to project power, not only in Europe, but also into the Middle East and down into Africa.</p><p>And of course, even the United States does not have enough capability to do everything that needs to be done to protect all of our interests around the world. We need allies, and all of our best and most reliable allies come from Europe, as well as Canada and Australia.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Apply for a seat at the table today.</em></strong></em></u></a></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>Do you think this whole NATO-U.S. rift, whatever one calls it, is that all over behind us?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>NATO, the most successful and longest alliance in the history of the world, has 32 nations now. There are going to be huge disputes between nations all the time. France kicked NATO out back during the time of de Gaulle. They left the military structure of NATO for several decades, but came back. The U.S. had huge debates with the UK and France after the Suez crisis. Turkey and Greece have been almost at war throughout. So, there are always challenges inside any sort of a coalition or alliance for all kinds of obvious reasons. </p><p>The thing that kept us together was always American leadership and the commitment of several nations to say, look, this is too important for us to lose this collective security because of some argument over an economic thing or past grievance. And there's a reason that there are nations still in a queue wanting to join NATO, because they know that their security is so much better if they're part of this alliance.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>The core takeaway seems to be this pledge that all the members except for Spain have made to spend 5% of their GDP on military or military-related stuff. How big a deal is this?</em></em></p><p> <em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges:</em></strong></em> It's an expectation. It's a commitment that everybody achieves this 5% threshold for investment in defense: 3.5% for traditional, what we would consider defense investments, equipment, training, ammunition, personnel; and then 1.5% for infrastructure, rail, ports, cyber protection, all the things necessary to be able to move alliance capabilities around. </p><p>Obviously these things will be exploited in some countries. That would not shock me. But the key was that nations are going to invest in infrastructure, which is badly needed, and the cyber protection of this transportation infrastructure. But also, 3.5 % of GDP, that's almost double for every country from what it was 10 years ago. The United States is not even at 3.5 right now, by the way. So this is going to be a real increase. </p><p>Having said all that\u2014and I do believe in the importance of a metric like that\u2014the most important thing, of course, is capability. Do we have the actual capability to do what we're supposed to do? That\u2019s what will deter the Russians, not a sign on the board that says, hey, we're 3.5. It\u2019s real capability: units that are properly trained, fully manned and have lots of ammunition, aircraft that fly, ships that sail. That's got to be the focus. So I'm glad we got this done, but now we've got to make sure that we turn that money into real capability.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>Do you mean how they spend it? </em></em> </p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>That is a part of it. Where does it go? Germany has a lot of money out there, but the processes are still several years behind. So they've got to fix things internally to take all these euros and turn them into combat formations and capability. They've got the right leadership now to do that in Chancellor Merz.</p><p>But also, I think it's important that we emphasize the importance of readiness to be able to fight tonight. This is a mindset thing. It's not just about buying new planes and equipment and hundreds of thousands of drones. Are you ready to actually deploy on very short notice and fight tonight? Can you get there and do you have what you need? To me, that has got to be job one for every secretary of defense, ministers of defense\u2014 readiness.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>On that \u201cfight tonight\u201d point, it is worth noting that these pledges are to be met by 2035. That's 10 years from now. And obviously, some of the stuff we're talking about takes a long time to manufacture and get out to the battlefield. How concerned are you about that time frame?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges:</em></strong></em> It took us 10 years to get where we are now from Wales. A lot of nations are now spending more than they have since the end of the Cold War. So, of course, I don't like it. We should already be there, including the United States. But I think what we'll see is different leaders, including the American president, continue to track every year. You can't do what they call a hockey stick, where you stay where you are for eight years and then expect that you'll get credit for jacking it up at the end. So there's going to be continued pressure.</p><p>But honestly I don't think too many nations are going to need that pressure. What we're seeing in Germany and in the UK, Finland all the way down to Romania. They're not confused about who the enemy is \u2014 it's Russia. These countries were already moving well beyond 3.5% before this summit. So, I think we're on the right arc and right direction in most places, just not all.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

I had hoped that this summit would be another affirmation by the Alliance that we're going to do everything we can to help Ukraine. The organizers shortened it in hopes of making sure that President Trump would stay for the whole thing. And so Ukraine was kind of taken out of the agenda. </p><p>Nonetheless, what's most important is that there seems to have been a positive meeting there. And most of our European allies are even more committed to helping Ukraine defeat Russia.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>You've made the point that Russia is incredibly weakened militarily right now with casualties, the economy, and so forth. And it doesn't seem, in that sense, to be much of a threat. Of course, everything we're talking about and what they were talking about at the summit is all about the Russia threat. So how should we understand the nature of that threat given how weak the country is today?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>This is a great question. Russia, I was certain, would not have made it this long. Given the casualties that they have suffered, the effects of some sanctions on them, and now it looks like they've probably lost Iran as an ally or a source of drones. But China has picked up some of the slack. North Korea continues to provide ammunition. And Russia right now has transitioned to a wartime economy because of course they don't have to worry too much about whether or not the peasants are unhappy that they can't get a new refrigerator. Putin does not have to respond to this sort of thing the way any other democratic leader would have to respond. So he's putting a lot of resources into this. </p><p>That would be over if we could figure out how to stop Russia from exporting oil to China and India. But as long as they can keep doing that, and as long as oil prices stay up, then Russia can keep doing what they're doing for quite some time. At the recent economic forum that Russia hosts each year, President Putin sort of downplayed the economic situation challenges they have. But his own people publicly were saying that they're almost in recession, that they are in fact in trouble.</p><p>What I am sure of is that if Ukraine capitulates or fails, or if we turn our back on Ukraine and Russia is able to take a couple of years to rebuild and fix what is broken, they will be knocking on the door of Moldova and probably of Latvia. Their objective is to break the alliance, to show NATO that nations are not really willing to fight against Russia over a piece of Estonia or Latvia. That would be their terrible miscalculation. So to make sure that the Russians never make that terrible miscalculation, we have to get back to where we were in the Cold War days of spending what's necessary, being prepared so that you can have another 40-50 years of no war with Russia.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

As the population in hotels shot up, so did the bill. Over that period, spending on hotels outside of New York City more than tripled to $110 million.</p>\n\n<p>OTDA oversees the state\u2019s county-run social services districts. The agency\u2019s commissioner, Barbara Guinn, said that it prefers that counties use shelters, but that there aren\u2019t enough beds for everyone who needs one. She said that the agency hadn\u2019t studied the growth in hotel use.</p>\n        \n            \n    \n    \n    \n                            \n\n    \n            Required Services in Shelters vs. Hotels\n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Note: Requirements are for hotels outside of New York City. New York regulations state that hotels can be considered shelters, and thus mandated to provide services. But there aren\u2019t any that are currently required to do so, Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance spokesperson Anthony Farmer said.

New York requires family shelters to provide services like child care, assistance finding housing and three meals a day. But the regulations generally exempt hotels.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s an exception: A hotel is supposed to be considered a shelter if it \u201cprimarily\u201d serves temporary housing recipients. OTDA spokesperson Anthony Farmer said that the agency interprets \u201cprimarily\u201d to mean \u201cexclusively, or almost exclusively,\u201d and that no hotels currently meet that standard. An analysis of the agency\u2019s data by New York Focus and ProPublica found that welfare recipients made up over half of the capacity for at least 16 hotels during fiscal year 2024.</p>\n\n<p>Guinn said that social services offices have to work within the confines of what hotel owners will allow, and that counties try to provide services off-site.</p>\n        \n            \n    \n    \n    \n                            \n\n    \n            The Number of Individuals and Families Housed in Hotels for More Than Six Months Nearly Tripled From 2022 to 2024\n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Data Source: Analysis of Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance data on emergency shelter payments.

If they don\u2019t have a pretty substantial effort to move people quickly back into housing and provide the services that are necessary to do that, the shelters quickly fill up, and then they just need more shelters.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Farmer said via email that a lack of affordable housing contributes to the longer stays, and that counties can use other funding to help people move back into permanent housing.</p>\n        \n            \n    \n    \n    \n                            \n\n    \n            New York Social Services Agencies Frequently Paid Hotels Over Fair Market Rent for a Two-Bedroom Apartment\n                <p>Nearly half of all payments to hotels were for more than twice the counties\u2019 FMR.</p>\n\n    \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Data Source: Analysis of Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance data on emergency shelter payments; U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development fair market rent data for two-bedroom apartments in each county for federal fiscal year 2024.\n    \n            (Lucas Waldron/ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Many hotels are charging rates higher than rent for permanent housing.</p>\n\n<p>The news organizations found that the overwhelming majority of hotel payments exceeded fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the same county. (Fair market rent is defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as the 40th percentile of rent plus utilities in the local housing market.) The rates charged were often more than twice that.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re forced to rent hotel rooms across the state, and the operators of these places understand that,\u201d said state Sen. Roxanne Persaud, a Democrat and chair of the chamber\u2019s Social Services Committee. \u201cThe municipalities\u2019 backs are against the wall. And so they must place the unhoused person or persons somewhere.

Roaches, mold, broken windows and filthy linens were common. Some hotels were subject to over a hundred emergency calls a year for assaults, robberies, mental health crises, overdoses and other incidents.</p>\n\n<p>Hotels sheltering homeless families are supposed to be inspected every six months by their county\u2019s social services office. Yet data obtained from OTDA shows that many wind up behind schedule. As of October, about 40% of hotels were either out of date on their inspection or didn\u2019t have one listed. </p>\n\n<p>Farmer, the OTDA spokesperson, said that nearly all hotels were inspected within a year, and that some had stopped accepting welfare recipients.</p>\n\n<p>Guinn, the commissioner, said that OTDA will formally propose rules this year clarifying that people in hotels must receive the same services as they would receive in shelters. She also said her agency will increase oversight of how social services offices are delivering those services.</p>",

    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-math-behind-trump-s-1-trillion-defense-budget",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014</strong> \u201cThe President's FY \u201826 [Fiscal Year 2026] National Defense Budget requests $1.01 trillion, which is a 13 percent increase from FY '25 enacted [as authorized but not yet funded by Congress] levels. This [FY \u201826] includes $848.3 billion for DoD's [Defense Department\u2019s] discretionary budget and $113.3 billion in mandatory funding for DoD via [the FY \u201925] reconciliation [bill now before the Senate] totaling $961.6 billion total for the Department of Defense.\u201d</p><p>That was a Senior DoD Official briefing reporters last Thursday, on newly-released details of the Trump administration\u2019s defense budget request for the fiscal year 2026, which begins October 1, 2025 and ends September 30, 2026.</p><p>In the best of times, the DoD budget process is difficult to understand, but this year it is even more complicated than most. The final defense budget figure depends not only on passage of the FY 2026 Appropriations Bill, but also on the FY 2025 reconciliations bill.</p><p>In addition, there are some interesting differences among the Pentagon, House and Senate on how the money is to be spent.</p><p>Ideally, a President sends his annual budget proposal to Congress early in the year\u2014late January for example. Congress holds authorization hearings followed by appropriation hearings, and the bills get marked up and passed before the next federal government fiscal year begins on October 1.</p><p>But when it comes to defense, for 11 of the past 12 fiscal years, DoD has had to operate under continuing resolutions (CRs) for some months because Congress in those years was unable to pass the necessary defense appropriations bills until after the new fiscal year began.</p><p>From DoD\u2019s point of view, that has caused problems because under CRs spending levels normally remain the same as the previous year. CRs also prohibit new starts, disrupt production schedules and generally interfere with defense planning. The situation becomes even more complicated in years of presidential transition.</p><p>The fiscal 2025 defense budget was originally put together under the Biden administration. Congress, after President Trump was elected, delayed passage of the Biden fiscal 2025 defense spending plan, approving two short-term CRs. Finally, after Trump became president, Congress approved a full year CR in mid-March 2025. That put DoD funding for this current fiscal year at $852 billion, just one percent above what it was in FY 2024.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Trump administration was working with DoD officials on the FY 2026 defense budget, which the Biden administration back in 2024, had projected would be $876.8 billion.</p><p>Then, on April 7, 2025, during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump, after mentioning that he had built up the U.S. military during his first term in office, suddenly said, \u201cWe have great things happening with our military.\u201d</p><p>Trump went on to say something that he had not said publicly before: \u201cWe also essentially approved a budget\u2026you'll like to hear this, of a trillion dollars, $1 trillion and nobody's seen anything like it. We have to build our military and we're very cost conscious, but the military is something that we have to build and we have to be strong because you got a lot of bad forces out there now. So, we're going to be approving a budget and I'm proud to say, actually the biggest one we've ever done for the military.\u201d</p><p>Trump\u2019s statement about $1 trillion for defense in FY 2026 then became the marching order, but how to do it was the question. A month later, the answer appeared publicly in the form of the FY 2025 reconciliation bill.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em></em></p><p>Since the January presidential inauguration, the Trump administration and Republican leadership had been working on this reconciliation bill in order to change much of the Biden FY 2025 budgeting by aligning all spending, taxes, revenue, and the debt limit with a new, agreed-upon FY 2025 Trump budget.</p><p>Among many features of this FY 2025 Trump reconciliation bill was the insertion of a $150 billion lump sum for defense programs, to be paid out of U.S. Treasury funds available through 2029. There had been no congressional hearings\u2014the number just appeared.</p><p>In early May, when Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released its full government fiscal 2026 \u2018skinny\u2019 budget, public mention was first made of the $150 billion defense package in the reconciliation bill -- and that some $113 billion of it was to be earmarked for the Pentagon\u2019s fiscal 2026 budget.</p><p>That meant DoD\u2019s FY 2026 base budget remained near FY 2025\u2019s $852 billion, but you reached Trump\u2019s announced $1 trillion for overall defense spending by adding the $113 billion in the reconciliation bill along with funds for nuclear weapons paid for by the Energy Department.</p><p>Back in May, at the time of that OMB announcement, Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) said, \u201cFor the defense budget, OMB has requested a fifth year straight of Biden administration funding, leaving military spending flat, which is a cut in real terms\u2026I have said for months that reconciliation Defense spending does not replace the need for real growth in the military's base budget.\u201d</p><p>He was joined at that time by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky), the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, who said, \u201cMake no mistake: a one-time influx reconciliation spending is not a substitute for full-year appropriations.\u201d</p><p>On May 22, in a 215-to-214, largely party-line vote, the House passed its version of the FY 2025 reconciliation bill, containing the $150 billion defense package. The reconciliation bill is now up for debate in the Senate. An advantage for the Trump administration in the reconciliation process is that Senate rules allow for a simple majority vote (51 votes) for reconciliation bills, bypassing the usual 60-vote threshold on controversial measures needed to overcome a filibuster.</p><p>Meanwhile, House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees have held hearings on the Trump fiscal 2026 DoD budget request with mixed results.</p><p>On June 12, the House Appropriations Committee passed its version of the FY 2026 DoD funding bill that followed the OMB May proposal, keeping the numbers close to the FY 2025 level and reaching the $1 billion Trump goal by adding the earmarked $113 billion in the pending FY 2025 reconciliation bill.</p><p>However, questions were raised at the June 18 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was one of the witnesses.</p><p>Chairman Wicker said, \u201cWhat we have in front of us is an inadequate budget request with precious little detail and no follow on data about fiscal years 2027, 2028, or 2029. We must assume, and in fact we have heard, that OMB intends to maintain defense spending at $893 billion across the four years of this administration. So even with a one-time $150 billion [fiscal 2025] reconciliation [bill] infusion, this would leave us at 2.65% of GDP by 2029, below 3 percent of GDP and well below the 5 percent of GDP that we really need.\u201d</p><p>Wicker went on, \u201cI understand that if you put reconciliation and the budget request together for this year [FY2026] it exceeds 3 percent, but if we go back to that same baseline for the next three years, after that we'll be under 3 percent. Do you intend to fix that?\u201d</p><p>Hegseth agreed that going below 3 percent would be very dangerous, adding, \u201cSo does the President of the United States which is why this budget increases from FY25 1.3 percent [if you include reconciliation bill\u2019s $113 billion] and puts us at 3.5 percent of GDP on defense.\u201d</p><p>President Trump recently returned from the NATO summit at The Hague where he took credit for the allies adopting a 2035 goal of 3.5 percent for member countries\u2019 core defense spending. It could be embarrassing for the President to find himself below that amount back home.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\">Sign up today</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Another question raised at Wednesday\u2019s Armed Services hearing was exactly how the reconciliation bill defense money would be spent. At issue was the tradition known as \u201ccongressional intent,\u201d for Congress to designate spending amounts for specific defense items in legislation.</p><p>At the June 18 Armed Services hearing, Wicker asked, \u201cWe will put funds in the reconciliation bill, working with the House and working with the Administration, to get the [President\u2019s] signature on the bill. And we will make clear alongside that the specific congressional intent [on defense items]\u2026Mr. Secretary [Hegseth] do you commit to following congressional intent unequivocally on reconciliation.\u201d</p><p>After Hegseth gave a qualifying answer, Wicker demanded, \u201cDo you commit to following congressional intent unequivocally in reconciliation?\u201d This time, Hegseth answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I mention this because last Wednesday, Chairman Wicker released what he called an \u201cupdated legislative text of the defense reconciliation bill.\u201d It showed his committee had cut down to $1 billion the $3.3 billion it had previously allocated to deployment of military personnel in support of border operations.</p><p>However, the next day, Thursday, at a Pentagon press conference called to discuss the FY 2026 defense budget, details of which had just been made available, a Senior Defense Official made clear the figure DoD had for the reconciliation bill was different. He said, \u201cThe $5 billion we're requesting [from the reconciliation bill] is for border security for our troops to actually be there as well as for detention support.\u201d</p><p>The Defense Official added of the reconciliation funding, \u201cIt's the first time the Department of Defense has received mandatory money like this. It's ten-year money with a lot more flexibility than the average discretionary dollar provides.\u201d Remember, under traditional circumstances, congressional intent language in statutes determines how defense money is to be spent.</p><p>Under the original reconciliation bill, DoD had 90 days after the legislation became law to send the House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees their plans for spending the $150 billion. What was to happen thereafter is not spelled out, but it\u2019s clear the \u201cflexibility\u201d that the Defense Official has seen is not recognized by Sen. Wicker and, I expect, others on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Will today\u2019s complex circumstances be repeated?</p><p>I saw a hint in something the Senior Defense Official said to reporters last Thursday. Asked about the top defense budget figure for FY 2027, he said, \u201cWe have not yet discussed what that will look like for [FY] '27. But unless the president's tone changes, I imagine we'll stick with $1 trillion for national defense spending.\u201d</p><p>After the June 18, Armed Services hearing, Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said, \u201cAs I understand it, OMB is saying we are going to have a flat defense budget for the next four or five years. Are we playing reconciliation every year from now on?\u201d</p><p>The answer is maybe.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

Exact figures remain difficult to verify, as independent assessments vary. But CCTV claims that the missile\u2019s range is <a href=\"https://interestingengineering.com/military/china-nuclear-missile-can-hit-anywhere-in-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">approximately</a> 12,000 kilometers (7,460 miles), putting most of the continental United States and Europe within reach. So, why does this matter?</p><p>While the details of the DF-5B match some already disclosed details, the notion that state television is putting such a public focus on this is \u201cunusual and perhaps speaks to a willingness on China\u2019s part to begin signaling its nuclear growth in a more public manner,\u201d according to Matt Korda, Associate Director at the Federation of American Scientists\u2019 Nuclear Information Project.</p><p>\u201cChina has not traditionally commented on the details of its weapon systems and instead almost always sticks to high-level talking points. Perhaps this portends a shift in the country\u2019s communications strategy,\u201d Korda, who also serves as Associate Senior Researcher for the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction Program, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>.</p><p>While the original DF-5 missile, <a href=\"https://as.com/actualidad/politica/china-da-detalles-del-monstruo-nuclear-heredero-de-la-guerra-fria-con-un-potencial-de-200-veces-hiroshima-n/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">developed</a> during the Cold War, was outfitted with a single warhead, the DF-5B\u2019s multi-warhead capacity\u2014alongside its purported accuracy within 500 meters\u2014 represents a significant leap in China\u2019s second-strike capability and nuclear survivability.</p><p>Andrew Erickson, a professor of strategy at the Naval War College and visiting China-focused scholar at Harvard University, believes that the renewed focus on this issue \u201cis part of a comprehensive effort to attempt to coerce and intimidate its adversaries regarding the military scenarios about which Beijing prioritizes most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeijing\u2019s goal is to show that it can match or exceed its adversaries on each rung of the escalation ladder; and also has the capability to utilize rungs, or combination of rungs, that its adversaries either do not possess or are more hesitant to use,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Andrew Scobell, Distinguished Fellow for China at the United States Institute of Peace, said, \u201cChina\u2019s communist rulers are feeling more insecure than usual, and this disclosure is their way of signaling \u2018don\u2019t mess with Beijing\u2019 to Washington and other capitals.\u201d</p><p> \u201cThe message is: China\u2019s nuclear weaponry and delivery systems are more capable today than ever before with a longer reach and greater accuracy,\u201d he tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>.</p><p><strong>A Rapidly Expanding Arsenal</strong></p><p>China\u2019s nuclear arsenal <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2025/06/chinas-nuclear-arsenal-surges-20-in-one-year-reaching-over-600-warheads-sipri/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">remains</a> smaller than those of Russia or the United States, but it is growing at an unprecedented rate. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reports that China has increased its warhead count by about 100 in the past year, rising from 500 in 2024, to <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2025/06/chinas-nuclear-arsenal-surges-20-in-one-year-reaching-over-600-warheads-sipri/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">over 600</a> by January 2025.</p><p>The SIPRI report notes that China is \u201cexpanding its nuclear arsenal <a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/nuclear-risks-grow-new-arms-race-looms-new-sipri-yearbook-out-now\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">faster than</a> any other nuclear-armed state.\u201d Experts estimate that by 2035, if current trends continue, China could possess as many as 1,500 nuclear warheads\u2014a threefold increase that would still place it behind the United States and Russia, which together hold nearly 90 percent of the global stockpile.</p><p>But Multiple Independently target-able Reentry Vehicles (MIRVs) \u2014allow a single missile to carry several nuclear warheads, each aimed at a different target. This dramatically complicates interception, as the warheads can overwhelm defenses by arriving on separate trajectories, making coordinated response far more difficult and costly.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

Depending on deployment strategies, this could enable China to deploy several ICBMs comparable to those of Russia or the United States by the decade\u2019s end.</p><p><strong>Implications for Deterrence and Stability</strong></p><p>China\u2019s shift comes as the framework for nuclear arms control faces significant strain. With New START, the last remaining treaty limiting Russian and U.S. strategic nuclear arsenals, set to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-warns-outlook-extending-last-nuclear-arms-pact-with-us-does-not-look-2025-02-10/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">expire</a> in early 2026, and no successor agreement in place, the global arms control architecture appears increasingly obsolete.</p><p>Some experts warn that the world is effectively entering an era of unchecked nuclear competition and worry that the <a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/nuclear-risks-grow-new-arms-race-looms-new-sipri-yearbook-out-now#:~:text=China's%20nuclear%20arsenal%20is%20growing,mountainous%20areas%20in%20the%20east\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">growing</a> deployment of artificial intelligence, space-based sensors, and cyber capabilities could erode crisis stability and introduce new pathways to escalation.</p><p>Advanced systems can compress decision-making time and increase the risk of miscalculation or technical error, particularly in multi-theater conflict scenarios involving China and Russia. According to SIPRI, \u201cthe signs are that a new arms race is <a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/nuclear-risks-grow-new-arms-race-looms-new-sipri-yearbook-out-now\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">gearing up</a> that carries much more risk and uncertainty than the last one.\u201d</p><p><strong>Strategic Consequences for the West</strong></p><p>The implications of China\u2019s buildup extend far beyond Asia. Despite Russia and the United States\u2019 decades-long atomic dominance, China\u2019s rapidly expanding nuclear missile arsenal indicates a profound shift in global strategic dynamics.</p><p>For the West, experts emphasize that China\u2019s nuclear buildup is raising the stakes of deterrence and complicates arms control efforts. It also demands an urgent reassessment of defense postures\u2014particularly as Beijing builds a more flexible, survivable, and modernized nuclear triad \u2013 the ability to launch nuclear weapons from land-based missiles, submarine-launched missiles, and strategic bombers. This capability enables Beijing to more credibly challenge Western military presumptions.</p><p>\u201cAdvanced nuclear weapons and delivery systems are the ultimate backstop supporting Beijing\u2019s efforts to impose a Sisyphean sense of futility on its enemies while supporting the ultimate warfighting options should that preferred approach ultimately fail to deliver,\u201d Erickson said.</p><p>Analysts with the Federation of American Scientists have <a href=\"https://fas.org/publication-term/arms-control/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">observed</a> that China\u2019s expanded ICBM infrastructure enables more flexible deployment, blending fixed silos with mobile launchers and dual-use capabilities, which complicate both detection and preemption. And as the U.S. continues to serve as the primary security guarantor for Europe and the Indo-Pacific, it faces the potential challenge of confronting multiple nuclear-capable adversaries simultaneously. For example, if drawn into parallel conflicts\u2014such as a war in Ukraine and a Taiwan Strait crisis\u2014experts worry that its conventional forces could become overstretched, increasing a reliance on nuclear deterrence.</p><p><strong>The Next Phase of the Nuclear Race</strong></p><p>DF-5B represents more than just a technical advancement for Beijing; it is a calculated message to the world. China\u2019s modernization efforts are now a tangible reflection of the leadership\u2019s ambition to move closer to nuclear parity\u2014particularly in capability and survivability\u2014with the United States and Russia.</p><p>With arms control faltering and nuclear parity drawing near, the world is poised for a new era of strategic competition, marked by high stakes, blurred red lines, and faster-moving threats.

Deterring China is already a complex endeavor that is made even more challenging in today\u2019s tense U.S.-China environment.</p><p>Korda believe that engaging China in arms control talks will be challenging, as Beijing would \u201chave to accept some degree of transparency to join a verifiable arms control regime, and it has traditionally preferred to rely on opacity to safeguard its smaller nuclear arsenal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn addition, China is likely concerned that the United States\u2013\u2013particularly through its ever-expanding missile defense architecture, is seeking to erode its state of mutual vulnerability with its nuclear adversaries,\u201d he said.</p><p>According to Korda, China likely perceives time to be on its side as it continues to expand its nuclear arsenal and \u201cwill likely wait to engage in significant talks until it gains the leverage it thinks it needs to become a more equal negotiating partner.\u201d</p><p>Erickson contends that Beijing\u2019s strategic ambiguity remains central to its doctrine: a tactic and a message.</p><p>\u201cChina doesn\u2019t want us to understand their deterrence strategy; that lack of clarity is baked into the ambiguity,\u201d he notes. \u201cFor twenty years of dialogue on these issues, the Chinese government and Chinese experts outside of government did not engage meaningfully.

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION --</strong> The core lessons from the Cold War should guide us as we face the new \u201cAxis of Aggressors\u201d today. First among these, is that we need to win the technology race.</p><p>Advanced technology made in United States did more than just put an American on the moon, it also solidified our economic foundation, empowered long-term entrepreneurial American leadership, and protected our national interests. </p><p>Maintaining this technology leadership should continue to be our priority today. Despite the Biden and Trump Administrations trying to limit the sale of U.S. software used to design semiconductors to Chinese groups, the U.S. government simply has not taken enough meaningful action to actually protect America\u2019s leadership position.</p><p>China is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-publish-policy-boost-risc-v-chip-use-nationwide-sources-2025-03-04/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">embracing</a> loopholes and openly flaunting strategic workarounds in our export policy that allows for the continued development of high-quality semiconductor chips with U.S. technology in China, despite our efforts to restrict Chinese access to such tools.</p><p>Along these same lines, Beijing plans to expand the use of open-source chip technology such as RISC V, in order to ween off its reliance on the West and spur the development of advanced chips in China. By leveraging RISC-V, Chinese companies are using open source software derived in the West to design their own processors for AI, cloud computing, and even military applications without violating current U.S. export restrictions.</p><p>And this shift is happening now.</p><p>Chinese tech giants like Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei have invested heavily in RISC-V research and development, looking to exploit this back-door access to western open source technology. Additionally, Chinese government-backed initiatives are pouring billions into this effort, positioning it as a national priority.</p><p>This should not have been a surprise: after all, <a href=\"https://jamestown.org/program/examining-chinas-grand-strategy-for-risc-v/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">experts</a> have been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/opinion-restoring-america/3289231/how-china-tech-threatens-us-cybersecurity/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">warning</a> for years that this day would come, and China<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-publish-policy-boost-risc-v-chip-use-nationwide-sources-2025-03-04/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> reportedly</a> plans to issue policy guidance to boost the use of RISC-V chips.</p><p>This has not gone completely unnoticed, though. <a href=\"https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/press-releases/gallagher-rubio-select-committee-members-urge-sec-raimondo-safeguard-american\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Congress</a> has been looking at this technology and China\u2019s ability to exploit it, and has rightfully raised a red flag, while the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security has been ramping up <a href=\"https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2024/12/us-strengthens-export-controls-on-advanced-computing-items#:~:text=BIS%20amended%20the%20Export%20Administration,Control%20Classification%20Numbers%20(ECCNs).\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">export controls</a> on advanced chip products.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

The Trump administration has already made significant strides in this realm \u2013 as evidenced by the recent <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/another-historic-investment-secured-under-president-trump/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">$100 billion investment</a> by TSMC in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT Q&amp;A \u2014 </strong><em>NATO leaders convened in The Hague this week for a summit aiming to strengthen the alliance's defenses, with the ever encroaching threat of Russia in mind. The meeting was largely a success, with all members (barring Spain) pledging to meet a new 5% GDP defense spending target. It was also a moment for NATO to project unity and recommit to collective defense, following skepticism from the administration of President Donald Trump, who was receptive and praised the alliance \u2014 saying it is not a \"rip-off\" as he has previously said. Ukraine, while a key topic at previous summits in recent years, was notably on the backburner this time around.<br /></em></p><p><em>The Cipher Brief caught up with General Philip Breedlove (Ret.), a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, for a post-summit debrief to see what positives came out of the gathering and where he is looking next, from how NATO members go about expanding defense capabilities to whether the alliance offers more support to Ukraine and pressures Russia. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. You can watch the full discussion at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFz40aEAdyw\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief's YouTube channel</a>.</em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><p><em></em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong><em>Did things end the way you thought they needed to end this week at the Hague?</em></p><p><em>General Breedlove: </em>We had a great summit. Let's give some credit to Secretary General [Mark] Rutte and the members of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) because we needed unity. When the U.S. president arrived, they had come to unity on the 5% spending commitment. And I think that set the stage. Our president was the first president in the history of NATO to get the organization to seriously invest when he pushed hard on the 2%. So, it went very well.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong></em><em>This felt like a summit that was almost tailor-made for the president. It was an easy pop-in, not a lot of debate, not a lot of back and forth. They knew what to expect going into it. Do you think that that helped fuel the outcome?</em></p><p><em><strong>General Breedlove:</strong> </em>Yes. Very few people understand how NATO works. The secretary general is actually very important, but he's not the decider. He works for the NAC, just like the Supreme Allied Commander of Europe (SACEUR) works for the NAC. Secretary General Rutte has managed the process extremely well to get everybody to where he needed them to be. We need to give him some credit for organizing all of the nations to get them to the right place.</p><p>I think their vision was to keep this short, to the point, get to the things that the U.S. president wants to accomplish, get those accomplished, and come out of this with a big unifying statement. And who is that unifying statement for? Of course, it's for all of our nations and our alliance. But the most important recipient of that message is Mr. Putin.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

He tries to peel off individual countries and leaders. Secretary General Rutte pulled the team together, got them on the same playbook, moved out and didn't waste any time. And I think that's exactly how this U.S. president likes to work.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong></em><em>It was clear going into this that Russia is the real threat to NATO. It's still a little bit unclear as to where President Trump is going to come down on Russia when it comes to how much pressure he's going to be willing to apply. We saw a little bit of movement toward the possibility of more support for Ukraine. What do you think the options are there? And if you\u2019re the Russian president, how are you looking at the outcome of this summit in particular?</em></p><p><em>General Breedlove</em><em>: </em>I'm both encouraged and discouraged on this front. I think there are a lot of people who believe we're ready now and we should be going in with the next round of heavy sanctions on Russia, to go after fuels and the shadow fleet. Our U.S. secretary of state, in his statement, said we're not going there now because it might preclude some sort of a ceasefire or peace agreement in Ukraine. So, he's going to hold off. Russia won that round. That's what they want. Keep stalling, keep the Americans thinking there's going to be a deal, and keep attacking Ukraine. So, we've got to move past that. And I think eventually this is going to happen.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

    "description": "<p><strong>CIPHER BRIEF EXPERT Q&amp;A </strong>\u2014<em><em> NATO leaders convened at The Hague this week and agreed to raise the alliance\u2019s defense spending target to 5% GDP, marking a significant pledge to expand defense capabilities. A key component is the 1.5% dedicated to defense- and security-related spending, a broad category that covers everything from critical infrastructure cybersecurity to upgrading transportation infrastructure for military logistics. Experts say this is a needed area to bolster defense posture, in addition to the traditional purchase of jets, tanks and arms.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Earlier this week, Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery urged NATO to adopt the 1.5% commitment in a </em></em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/nato-s-critical-1-5-percent\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><em>piece in The Cipher Brief</em></em></u></a><em><em>.

Success or still a lot of work?</em></p><p><em><strong><em>RADM Montgomery: </em></strong></em>I think with an alliance like NATO, there is always a lot of work. You've got 32 countries, you have 32 ideas, you have 32 threat assessments. But I actually think it went exceptionally well. It went exceptionally well because Secretary General Rutte did a great job corralling the players, with the exception of Spain. But he did a great job with 31, and then he did a terrific job managing President Trump \u2014 and that's no easy feat.</p><p>This was a landmark summit. The Hague 2025 will be remembered for a true commitment to deterring Russia, and if necessary defeating them if they were to invade a NATO state. And the five percent is certainly part of it, but the language, the direction, the focus, the corralling back in of the United States, all that happened at this summit.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Craving more expert insights into national security? Subscribe to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxe0CtWYQdk\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s YouTube channel</a> to watch our interview with RADM Mark Montgomery.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em>One thing that wasn't really discussed in any kind of depth was Ukraine. Obviously with Russia being sort of the looming cloud over NATO, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on that.</em></p><p><em><strong><em>RADM Montgomery: </em></strong></em>I fully support Ukraine and I think we should do as much as we can to help them. I recognize, though, that this 5 percent and the discussion of whether Article 5 applies really was about signatory states. There's a deep, deep issue there that we have to be agreed that we're going to defend Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, particularly. I think they're the four most vulnerable states if they're attacked.</p><p>Separate from that is the issue that right now the European country in combat with Russia that was illegally invaded by Russia, Ukraine, has relied heavily on NATO support because most of NATO recognizes that if you don't deter Russia here, their next ambition could be Moldova, but it could be Estonia. It could be Romania or Georgia, or it could be the Suwalki Gap and a land bridge to Kaliningrad.</p><p>So with all that in play, it was critical that Zelensky got a good reception. I think he did. And the fact that the Ukrainian section was shortened from 42 paragraphs to 10 paragraphs, I don't care. In the end it said we support Ukraine. The NATO contact group is working hard to support Ukraine. European countries are giving Ukraine a lot of money.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

There is no European alternative to the Patriot line at Raytheon or to the AMRAAM line in the United States, which is the weapon that goes in their NASAMs air defense system. There's no European alternative to a million rounds a year of 155mm. You're going to need the U.S. to be involved in that. And therefore, it was critical for the president to say that these lines are available to Ukraine. And he did that on two or three different occasions. It wasn't as clean as I'd like it, but he clearly indicated that was his intention.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em>Next steps for NATO. What do you think?</em></p><p><em><strong><em>RADM Montgomery: </em></strong></em>First, glad to see the 5%. I was really glad that they broke it down to 3.5-1.5, mostly because they'd have never gotten a 5% on planes, tanks, and ships. You'd have had more than Spain break away then \u2014 you might've had the UK, France, and Germany. Or they'd put a due date like 2050, something that doesn't really matter. I'm disappointed it slipped to 2035. It should have been 2032 like the Eastern Europeans wanted. Most of the Eastern Europeans, by the way\u2014Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Poland\u2014are passing through 4% already and heading to 5% within the next 12 months. And that's just on aircraft, ships, and tanks kind of stuff.</p><p>What I really loved about this was the 1.5%. This is about getting cyber right and critical infrastructure protection right. It's about building your defense industrial base. But talking about cyber and critical infrastructure, when you say what's next for NATO, at the last summit, they approved a NATO critical infrastructure center. They put it at SACEUR, and that's critical because what we have to do now is take that center as it comes online in the next year, SACEUR\u2019s war plans, and this money and build the infrastructure that's necessary for the United States to flow our forces from the United States, the UK forces from across the channel, the French forces from deep in Europe\u2014those brigades, divisions, and even corps\u2014to be able to flow across Northern Europe from the ports and the airfields in Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Luxembourg, France, and get to the fight. That is not protected right now. That critical infrastructure is not prioritized and protected in a meaningful way. </p><p>So, in my mind, the big NATO takeaway is 1.5 percent, the cyber center, and a SACEUR with a war plan. If we can now build ourselves the ligature to deter Russia and if Russia is foolish enough to attack, defeat Russia in an invasion of an Article Five-defended country.</p><p><em><strong><em>Are you Subscribed to</em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong> </strong></em><u><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> on YouTube?

On that last and arguably most important front, the gathering at The Hague produced surprising results. </p><p>By the end of the summit, President Donald Trump\u2019s famous disdain for NATO had morphed into a gush. \u201cThis was a tremendous summit,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/world/europe/nato-increase-military-spending-trump.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the president said</a> at a news conference, \u201cI enjoyed it very much.\u201d </p><p>Trump spoke in glowing terms about the alliance - \u201cI left here differently,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/25/trump-nato-iran-ukraine/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a> and promised U.S. support for NATO\u2019s Article 5, which compels each member state to respond to an attack against any other, and which he had previously called into question. Trump was also clearly pleased with the summit\u2019s main achievement \u2013 a collective pledge by members to contribute 5% of their GDP to defense, something the U.S. president had wanted for years.</p><p>Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges (Ret.), former Commander of U.S. Army Forces in Europe, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em> that the summit\u2019s \u201cbest outcome\u201d was NATO\u2019s success at bringing Trump back into the fold.</p><p>\u201cThere was a huge sigh of relief in The Hague that he even showed up, Hodges told us. \u201cThere was some anxiety about that, or that he might blow it up somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was there, he stayed for the entire thing. He met with President Zelensky. We got an agreement on 5 % [spending]...and then a public affirmation of American commitment to the alliance by the president. That's pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually think it went exceptionally well,\u201d said Rear Admiral (Ret.) Mark Montgomery, a senior member of the <a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cyber Initiatives Group</a> and director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cIt went exceptionally well because NATO Secretary General [Mark] Rutte did a great job corralling the players\u2026and then he did a terrific job managing President Trump and that's no easy feat.\u201d </p><p>The costs of placating the U.S. president included hitting that 5% figure, which may be difficult for many members to meet, and a relegating of Ukraine\u2019s concerns to the summit\u2019s back burner.</p><p> At The Hague, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was pleased by what <a href=\"https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/4008310-zelensky-on-meeting-with-trump-we-spoke-about-how-to-achieve-ceasefire-real-peace.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he called</a> a \u201clong and meaningful\u201d meeting with President Trump, and Trump himself acknowledged Ukraine\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/as-nato-summit-fawns-over-daddy-trump-ukraine-gets-only-words-of-comfort/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">brave battle\u201d</a> in a way he hasn\u2019t done previously. Still, some in Ukraine noted that beyond verbal support from Trump and Rutte, there was little new NATO support for Kyiv.</p><p>\u201cThe problem for Ukrainians is that we are super tired from so many words,\u201d Oleksiy Goncharenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. He noted that June had been one of the worst months of the war in terms of civilian deaths, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been \u201cemboldened\u201d by a failure of the U.S. to hold Moscow accountable. \u201cWe want to see concrete results,\u201d Goncharenko said. \u201cWe want this war to end as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe NATO allies made some brutal and to some extent also cynical trade-offs,\u201d Liana Fix, a Europe expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThey wanted the summit to be a success for Donald Trump and to be about defense spending to secure their own security in the long term. It was not designed to be about Ukraine.\u201d</p><p><strong>A Trump surprise</strong></p><p>President Trump\u2019s pivot didn\u2019t just help with the atmospherics at The Hague. For the moment at least, it means that a bitter and dangerous NATO-U.S. rift has been mended. </p><p>Trump has mused out loud about ending U.S. financial and military commitments to NATO. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/20/trump-says-the-us-doesnt-have-to-meet-nato-spending-goal-00416154\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a> he saw no reason for the U.S. to meet the very 5% spending target he had pushed for \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think we should,\u201d he said \u2013 and on the eve of the summit he <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-iran-israel-nato-e34385f9b6e2ff5d0cf60f8aaea57a40\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">refused to commit</a> to U.S. support for Article 5. It \u201c<a href=\"https://semafor.com/s/i3H1R9WFxZ?email=tgnagorski@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">depends on your definition</a>,\u201d he said.</p><p>All that seemed like rear-view-mirror material by the time the summit wrapped at The Hague. Rutte\u2019s pre-summit flattering of Trump \u2013 including a leaked <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114738606142462442\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">private message</a> in which he praised the U.S. strikes against Iran and told the president he was \u201cflying into another big success in The Hague\u201d \u2013 seemed to have had the desired effect. Trump praised Rutte and the alliance, took credit for the spending pledges, and sought to put to rest any doubts about Washington\u2019s Article 5 commitments. \u201cI stand with it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d Trump said when asked to clarify his position. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t stand with it, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>That full-throated support allowed for a final <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_236705.htm?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=posts&amp;utm_campaign=250625%2Bmulti%2Bdeclaration\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">summit communiqu\u00e9</a> that included a reaffirmation of the \u201cironclad commitment to collective defense as enshrined in Article 5.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was important that the president affirmed it very strongly, clearly and publicly,\u201d Lt. Gen. Hodges told us. </p><p>\u201cDonald Trump committed to Article 5, but European NATO members paid a high price for that,\u201d Fix said. \u201cThe whole summit was about offering 5% to Donald Trump, flattering him and making sure that he stays in the alliance. Of course, it's also in the interest of European NATO allies to increase their defense spending, but they would have never come up with this 5% target. That was specifically for Donald Trump, and it worked.\u201d</p><p>Rutte also managed to achieve near consensus among the NATO members \u2013 32 of them \u2013 with the exception of Spain \u2013 committed to the 5 % ask; ultimately it was split into 3.5 % for core military elements \u2013 troops, missiles, ammunition \u2013 and another 1.5 percent for \u201cmilitarily adjacent\u201d spending that nations may devote to infrastructure and cybersecurity.</p><p>That drew praise from Rear Adm. Montgomery, who had advocated for the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/nato-s-critical-1-5-percent\" target=\"_self\">additional commitment</a>.</p><p>\u201cWhat I really loved about this was the 1.5 %,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about getting cyber right and critical infrastructure protection right.\u201d</p><p>Beyond the detailed spending targets, experts saw value in the unified message put forth at the summit, given recent transatlantic tensions.</p><p>\u201cThe degree to which the alliance acts in a unified voice, utilizes consensus, agrees on broad positions, that's a win for the alliance and a big defeat for Putin,\u201d Admiral James Stavridis, a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, <a href=\"https://thecipherbrief.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9775ab595d580738d839f9d01&amp;id=abf3e0c36b&amp;e=abcf227f11\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told <em>The Cipher Brief</em></a>. </p><p><strong>The skeptics \u2013 and the hurdles ahead</strong></p><p>For all the post-summit cheering, there was also skepticism about the implementation of the new 5 % commitments. </p><p>While Poland and the Baltic states are <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2025/04/14/sharing-the-burden-how-poland-and-germany-are-shifting-the-dial-on-european-defence-expenditure/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">already spending</a> nearly 5% of their GDP on defense, other NATO members hover close to 2% and will face political and economic challenges in meeting the new targets. Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez <a href=\"http://v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">refused</a> to sign on, saying his country would spend 2.1 percent of its GDP on defense, \u201cno more, no less.\u201d Slovakia and Belgium pledged to meet the target but said it would be difficult to do.</p><p>Experts noted that in the push to placate President Trump, NATO\u2019s European members had <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/nato-leaders-set-back-trump-defence-spending-goal-hague-summit-2025-06-24/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">agreed</a> to more than double their military spending at a time when many are already struggling to balance their budgets. Politically, these governments \u2013 particularly those in Western Europe, where the Russia threat is less palpable \u2013 may have trouble convincing their constituents that military spending should spike at the expense of outlays for social programs. </p><p>\u201cTo what extent will populists in Europe make defense spending a topic?\u201d asked Fix. \u201cDo they come up with claims like, \u2018Why should we spend for defense just to please Donald Trump? We could spend for social welfare and make a deal with Russia.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Then there is the timetable.</p><p>The NATO communique calls for members to meet their 5% target by 2035. Experts and some intelligence agencies have warned that while Russia\u2019s military and economy have been weakened, new Russian threats to Europe may arise within three to five years of an end of the Ukraine war. </p><p>Hodges and Montgomery both said they were disappointed by the long timeline. The Ukrainian president did too. </p><p>\u201cThis is slow,\u201d <a href=\"https://time.com/7297698/nato-2025-summit-trump-iran-ukraine-defense-topics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zelensky said</a> of the NATO timeline. \u201cWe believe starting in 2030, Putin can have significantly greater capabilities. Today, Ukraine is holding him up, he has no time to drill the army.\u201d </p><p>Finally, there is the question of how the money will be spent. As <em>The Cipher Brief </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/can-europe-really-defend-itself\" target=\"_self\">has reported</a>, European defense production has often been slowed or thwarted by continent-wide <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/06/19/this-weeks-nato-summit-will-be-all-about-placating-donald-trump\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">regulations</a>. And while overall defense strategy and standards have been set by NATO commanders, national military budgets and planning are decided by individual nations. Experts stressed the need for NATO\u2019s European members to spend their 5% in a strategic and coordinated fashion.</p><p>\u201cThe most important thing, of course, is capability,\u201d Lt. Gen. Hodges said. \u201cDo we have the actual capability to do what we're supposed to do? Because that's what will deter the Russians, not a sign on the board that says, Hey, we're at 3.5 percent. You know, it's real capability, units that are properly trained, fully manned, that have lots of ammunition, aircraft that fly and ships that sail. That's got to be the focus.\u201d</p><p><strong>Ukraine on the \u201cback burner\u201d</strong></p><p>Russia\u2019s full-scale of invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was the catalyst for a unified NATO front that had eluded the alliance since the end of the Cold War. This week, with the focus on NATO\u2019s overall defense spending, the recent <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts-assess-strikes-response-and-what-comes-next\" target=\"_self\">strikes against Iran</a>, and the wish to please President Trump, support for Ukraine took a back seat.</p><p>The good news for Ukraine came in the 50-minute meeting Trump held with Zelensky on the summit\u2019s sidelines. Trump spoke of the bravery of Ukrainians and said he would consider providing <a href=\"https://thecipherbrief.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9775ab595d580738d839f9d01&amp;id=3b74622b67&amp;e=abcf227f11\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more Patriot missiles to Ukraine</a> to counter Russian air strikes. \"We are going to see if we can make some of them available,\" Trump said. He also did not reject the idea of approving more U.S. military aid to Kyiv. </p><p>But there were no fresh commitments from NATO, only a general pledge of \u201ccontinued support\u201d for Ukraine. The communiqu\u00e9 made no promise of Ukraine\u2019s future membership in the alliance, which was taken as another concession to Trump, who opposes inviting Ukraine to join NATO. And Fix noted that NATO did not publish a Russia strategy at the summit, presumably over a concern that the U.S. would object \u2013 given the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to recognize Russia as the aggressor in the Ukraine war.</p><p>\u201cThis is my biggest disappointment from this summit, that Ukraine was put on a back burner,\u201d Lt. Gen. Hodges said. \u201cI'm glad that President Zelensky showed up, that he was invited and that he attended. I'm glad that President Trump met with President Zelensky\u2026and he was more positive about Ukraine than I'd heard from him in quite some time. But I had hoped that this summit would be another affirmation by the alliance that we're going to do everything we can to help Ukraine.\u201d </p><p>Goncharenko and other members of the Ukrainian parliament were particularly exasperated by the Trump administration\u2019s rationale for not imposing fresh sanctions against Russia. Trump threatened such sanctions following Russia\u2019s recent military strikes and Putin\u2019s intransigence at the negotiating table, but on the eve of the summit, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said sanctions were off the table for now. </p><p>\u201cIf we come in and crush them with more sanctions, we probably lose our ability to talk to them,\u201d Rubio said. </p><p>\u201cI really can't understand it,\u201d Goncharenko said. \u201cSo, in the case of Iran, to make them go to the negotiating table, their nuclear facilities were crushed by American bombing. And it looks like it worked, at least it looks like that for the moment. In the case of Russia, they say, if we crush them, we will lose the possibility to negotiate. I can't understand.\u201d</p><p>Goncharenko argued that the opposite would be a more logical approach. \u201cIf you want to have Russia at the negotiating table with seriousness, you need to crush them first,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don't understand any language except the language of strength.\u201d </p><p>Montgomery was more hopeful \u2013 for Ukraine and for Europe\u2019s overall posture toward Russia. </p><p>\u201cThe Hague 2025 will be remembered as where there was a true commitment to deterring Russia, and if necessary, defeating them if they were to invade a NATO state,\u201d Montgomery told us. \u201cAnd the 5 percent is certainly part of it, but the language, the direction, the focus, the crawling back of the United States, all that happened at this summit.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>This is exclusive Subscriber+Member content. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

    "description": "<p>Steps you can take to report the theft and check if it\u2019s being resold \u2013 as well as how to protect your next one</p><p>Whether you use your bike to commute daily, for a quick trips to the shops or long rides to keep fit, having it stolen can be a nightmare. Here\u2019s what to do if yours goes missing.</p><p>Report the theft to the police and describe the bike in as much detail as possible, giving the model, make and where it was stolen. You should also include a description of any scratches, dents and marks that could help identify it, and a picture if you have one. You can go into your local police station or call 101 in the UK to file a report. Make sure you get a crime reference number.</p><p>Home insurance policies will often cover your bike when it\u2019s at home but you will probably have needed to pay extra to extend this for when you\u2019re out and about, or if you have a valuable bike. Report the loss to your insurer and give it the crime reference number. Your bike will not be covered if you failed to look after it, such as not locking it securely or with a suitable lock.</p><p>Declare your bike stolen on <a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a>, a UK bike database \u2013 you can do this even if you have not registered your bike on there before. It will help improve the chances of your bike being recovered if there are pictures and descriptions of the bike, and where it was stolen.</p><p>Post on bike and cycling forums, such as <a href=\"https://forum.cyclinguk.org/\">Cycling UK Forum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeforums.net/]\">Bike Forum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclechat.net/\">CycleChat</a> in case people come across it when looking to buy a new bike.</p><p>Look on resale sites such as Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace and eBay to see whether someone is trying to sell your bike. You can set up alerts for bikes that are the same make and model. If you find one that looks like yours, alert the police \u2013 they may be able to recover it. It is not advisable to set up a sting or try to deal with the case yourself.</p><p>Alert the local community on neighbourhood forums such as Nextdoor or local Facebook groups and get in touch any bike shops nearby in case someone comes in to the shop and tries to sell one that matches your description.</p><p>Scuff the frame up a bit using sandpaper, paint and stickers so it is less appealing to thieves. Some kitsch, drawn-on hearts might save you a lot of hassle in the future.</p><p>Register it on <a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a> and upload pictures alongside the frame number, which is usually found on the bottom bracket shell between the pedals or on the rear dropouts where the back wheel slots in. This will help the police trace it back to you if it is stolen and recovered.</p><p>Invest in two high-quality locks to make your bike less of a target. At least one of these should be a good-quality D-lock. Be sure to attach the frame to the stand when locking up.</p><p>Take any removable parts with you whenever you leave it.</p><p>Find and apply for your nearest cycle parking. This gives another layer of protection, but be sure to still lock up securely. In cities there are also many cycle hangars, such as Cyclehoop, which are small bike stores on residential streets you can apply for at a small cost each year. <a href=\"https://www.cyclehoop.rentals/\">Check whether there\u2019s one near you</a>.</p><p>Conceal a Bluetooth tracker on your bike to help locate it if it goes missing. The smaller and more discreet the tracker, the better. Good spots to hide them include under the seat or inside the handlebar. Apple AirTag and Tile Sticker are popular among bike owners.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jun/11/what-to-do-if-your-bike-is-stolen-and-how-to-break-the-cycle\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "description": "<p><strong>4 March 1895</strong>: The popularity of cycling among the aristocracy is remarkable as the bicycle used to be looked upon as the poor man\u2019s horse</p><p>The increasing popularity of cycling among the \u2018aristocracy\u2019 is remarkable. Among recent recruits may be mentioned Lord Zetland, Lady Havelock Allan, Sir Joseph Pease, the Earl of Camperdown, the Duke of Westminster, and two of the daughters of the late Earl of Iddesleigh. Heretofore the only objection urged against the pastime has been its vulgarity. The bicycle was looked upon as the poor man\u2019s horse, and those who patronised it were considered very ordinary people. The utility of the bicycle as a means of conveyance, its capacity for causing harmless and elevating pleasure, and its undoubted health-giving qualities were all ignored at the dictates of the fashionable world. The said fashionable world have suddenly discovered the virtues of the cycle, and, ignoring the fact that even butchers\u2019 boys may derive pleasure from the same source, they have taken to it in numbers. The middle class, a large proportion of whom are born snobs, will, now that the only objection is removed, join the ranks in thousand. It will have an effect also even on those who are not snobs.</p><p>Heretofore many professional and business men have been afraid to appear in public on wheels simply because it would damage them from a business point of view. I have known leading doctors who have made a practice of rising in summer at 5am, to enjoy a long ride before breakfast simply because they dared not appear in public except in the irreproachable brougham. For such as these the bar is being removed.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/04/cycling-notes-snobbery-female-riders-and-dispensing-with-a-brake-1895\">Continue reading...</a>",

With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing</span><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1. What is affiliate marketing?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is an affiliate program?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.&nbsp; Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;5. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing?</span></h4><p><!--Ads Managed by AdSpyglass.com-->\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising.

Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7.

Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10.

If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.</span><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Imagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don\u2019t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That\u2019s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It\u2019s like your computer\u2019s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called \u201cBit Gold.\u201d However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">So, What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:</b></span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain collects information in \u201cblocks\u201d.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blocks form chains, which are called \u201cBlockchains.\u201d</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>Let\u2019s get to know more about the blockchain.</b></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How does blockchain work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Here\u2019s how it works:</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Someone or a computer will transacts</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The transaction is transmitted throughout the network.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A network of computers can confirm the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a block</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The blocks are linked together to create a history.</span></li></ul><p></p>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">And that\u2019s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it\u2019s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.</span></li></ul><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How are Blockchains used?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been\u2014so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is Blockchain Decentralization?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology is safe, even if it\u2019s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called \u201cDecentralization,\u201d meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain guarantees your data's authenticity\u2014not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros and Cons of Blockchain</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Accuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Safe, private, and easy transactions</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Provides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal information</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Cons</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Data storage has limits.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It has a risk of being used for illicit activities&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Frequently Asked Questions About Blockchain</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">I\u2019ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is Blockchain a cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the most prominent blockchain company?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Who owns Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It\u2019s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency&nbsp;</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1) What is an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFT stands for non-fungible&nbsp; token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2) What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information\u2014such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts\u2014in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can\u2019t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3) What makes an NFT valuable?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br />\n</span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn\u2019t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4) How do NFTs work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can\u2019t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFTs also contain smart contracts\u2014small computer programs that run on the blockchain\u2014that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5) What\u2019s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you\u2019ll be able to upload and sell your creations</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain\u2014the bitcoin ledger of transactions\u2014and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10) How do we buy an NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">11) Can i mint NFT for free?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it?</span></h3>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Why are people investing so much in NFT?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><span>&nbsp;Non-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don\u2019t own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet.</span><br /></span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">That\u2019s a wrap.

Why is email marketing important?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email is the marketing tool that helps you&nbsp; create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak&nbsp; to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is benefits of email marketing?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email marketing is best way for creating long term relationship with your clients, and increasing sales in our company.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Benefits of email marketing for bussiness:</span></div><div><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Better brand recognition</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Statistics of what works best</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More sales</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Targeted audience</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More traffic to your products/services/newsletter</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Build credibility</span></li></ul></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Most&nbsp; bussinesses are using email marketing and making tons of money with email marketing.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Again, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be&nbsp; times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your&nbsp; data to decide.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;4. Which metrics should I be looking at?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The two most important metrics for email marketing are&nbsp; open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5. How do I write a decent subject line?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing&nbsp; the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for&nbsp; A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and&nbsp; simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,&nbsp; then repeated&nbsp; at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example \"Click here to download the premium theme for free.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><br />\n\n<br />6. Is email marketing still effective?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site&nbsp; hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans&nbsp; see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely&nbsp; see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span><br /></span><br />\n\n<br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Buying an email list is&nbsp; waste of time &amp; money. These email accounts are unverified and not interested in your brand. The mailing list is useless if your subscribers do not open your emails. There are different ways to grow your mailing list.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span>Give them a free ebook and host it on a landing page where they have to enter the email to download the file and also create a forum page on your website, asks your visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collects email addresses to follow up with them.</span><br />\n\n<br /></span></div>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a\"></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8. How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">If the&nbsp; subject line of the email is irrelevant to&nbsp; customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus&nbsp; on sales, offers and discounts.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Submit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers. You can also update them on recent trends in your industry. The basic role of an email is first and foremost to&nbsp; connect with customers, get the most out of this tool.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">9. What is the difference between a cold email and a spam email?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Cold emails are mostly sales emails that are sent with content align to the needs of the recipient. It is usually personalized and includes a business perspective. However, it is still an unsolicited email. And all unsolicited emails are marked as SPAM.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Regularly receiving this type of unsolicited email in your users' inboxes, chances are&nbsp; your emails will soon be diverted to&nbsp; spam or junk folders. The most important thing to prevent this from happening is to respect your recipients' choice to opt-out of receiving emails from you. You can add the links to easily unsubscribe. You must be familiar with the CAN-SPAM Act and its regulations.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10. Where can I find email template?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Almost all email campaign tools provide you with ready-made templates. Whether you use MailChimp or Pardot, you'll get several email templates ready to use.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;However, if you want to create a template from scratch, you can do so.Most of email campaign tools have option to paste the HTML code of your own design.&nbsp;</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br />11. What email marketing trend will help marketers succeed in 2022?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is it a trend to listen to&nbsp; and get to know your customers? I think people realize how bad it feels for a brand or a company to obsess over themselves without knowing their customers personal needs. People who listen empathetically and then provide value based on what they learn will win.</span></div></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span><br /></span><span>Final Saying</span></span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;You can approach email marketing in different ways.
