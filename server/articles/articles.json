    "description": "<p>U.S. President <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a> has announced trade&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-japan-indonesia-philippines-6e1829cb570d945d13c00f07059a41d4\">deals with Japan</a>&nbsp;and a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91373062/global-markets-rally-following-trumps-tariffs-deal-japan\">handful of other Asian countries</a> that will relieve some pressure on companies and consumers from sharply higher tariffs on their exports to the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91316416/how-trump-china-tariffs-trade-war-threatens-glitter-nail-polish-raising-prices\">deal with China</a> is under negotiation, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying an August 12 deadline might be postponed again to allow more time for talks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steep tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum remain, however, and many other countries, including South Korea and Thailand, have yet to clinch agreements. Overall, economists say the tariffs inevitably will dent growth in Asia and the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-deals-reached-so-far-ahead-of-trump-s-august-1-deadline\">The deals reached so far, ahead of Trump\u2019s August 1 deadline</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump and Japanese&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/japan-politics-election-ishiba-parliament-vote-ldp-0abc031590660859c3ea0a5da9d83310\">Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba</a>&nbsp;announced a deal Wednesday that will impose 15% tariffs on U.S. imports from Japan, down from Trump&#8217;s proposed 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a huge relief for automakers like Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda, whose shares jumped by double digits in Tokyo. Trump also announced trade deals with\u00a0<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/marcos-trump-philippines-china-tariffs-3138d1d7f8368c022ab9242bebb4a2e2\">the Philippines</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/07/joint-statement-on-framework-for-united-states-indonesia-agreement-on-reciprocal-trade/\">Indonesia.</a>\u00a0After meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., Trump said the import tax on products from his country would be subject to a 19% tariff, down just 1% from the earlier threat of a 20% tariff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indonesia also will face a 19% tariff, down from the 32% rate Trump had recently said would apply, and it committed to eliminating nearly all of its trade barriers for imports of American goods. Earlier, Trump announced that Vietnam&#8217;s exports would face a 20% tariff, with double that rate for goods transshipped from China, though there has been no formal announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-talks-with-china-may-be-extended\">Talks with China may be extended</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Negotiations with China are subject to an August 12 deadline, but it&#8217;s likely to be extended, Bessent told Fox Business on Tuesday. He said the two sides were due to hold another round of talks, this time in Sweden, early next week. Meanwhile, Trump said a\u00a0<a href=\"https://apnews.com/9d2364e26c3e250ff70c1c39ff567a3c\">trip to China</a>\u00a0may happen soon, hinting at efforts to stabilize U.S.-China trade relations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A preliminary agreement announced in June paved the way for China to lift some restrictions on its exports of rare earth elements, minerals critical for high technology and other manufacturing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May, the U.S. agreed to drop\u00a0<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/china-us-trump-tariffs-2e05057e973e1e26d1b95c5be003b4cd\">Trump&#8217;s 145% tariff</a>\u00a0rate on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days, while China agreed to lower its 125% rate on U.S. goods to 10%. The reprieve allowed companies more time to rush to try to beat the potentially higher tariffs, giving a boost to Chinese exports and alleviating some of the pressure on its manufacturing sector. But prolonged uncertainty over what Trump might do has left companies wary about committing to further investment in China.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-no-deals-yet-for-south-korea-and-other-asian-countries\">No deals yet for South Korea and other Asian countries</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pressure is mounting on some countries in Asia and elsewhere as the August 1 deadline for striking deals approaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump sent letters, posted on Truth Social,\u00a0<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-countries-letters-166230b4fa2be33ece1825322b34ff6a\">outlining higher tariffs</a>\u00a0some countries will face if they fail to reach agreements. He said they&#8217;d face even higher tariffs if they retaliate by raising their own import duties. South Korea&#8217;s is set at 25%. Imports from Myanmar and Laos would be taxed at 40%, Cambodia and Thailand at 36%, Serbia and Bangladesh at 35%, South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina at 30%, and Kazakhstan, Malaysia, and Tunisia at 25%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The status of talks with India remains unclear, but progress appears to hinge on the country&#8217;s heavily protected farm sector. It faces a 26% tariff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly every country has faced a minimum 10% levy on goods entering the U.S. since April, on top of other sectoral levies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-economists-expect-tariffs-to-sap-growth-even-with-trade-deals\">Economists expect tariffs to sap growth even with trade deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after Trump has pulled back from the harshest of his threatened tariffs, the onslaught of uncertainty and higher costs for both manufacturers and consumers has raised risks for the regional and global economy. Economists have been downgrading their estimates for growth in 2025 and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Asian Development Bank said Wednesday it had cut its growth estimate for economies in developing Asia and the Pacific to 4.7% in 2025 and 4.6% in 2026, down 0.2 percentage points and 0.1 percentage points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The outlook for the region could be further dimmed by an escalation of tariffs and trade friction, it said. \u201cOther risks include conflicts and geopolitical tensions that could disrupt global supply chains and raise energy prices,\u201d as well as a deterioration in China&#8217;s ailing property market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Economists at AMRO were less optimistic, expecting growth for Southeast Asia and other major economies in Asia at 3.8% in 2025 and 3.6% next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While countries in the region have moved to protect their economies from Trump&#8217;s trade shock, they face significant uncertainties, said AMRO&#8217;s chief economist Dong He.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUneven progress in tariff negotiations and the potential expansion of tariffs to additional products could further disrupt trade activities and weigh on growth for the region,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u2014By Elaine Kurtenbach, AP business writer</em></p>",

Now, individuals on the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan will experience a temporary halt in forgiveness, <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/idr-court-actions\">the Department of Education (DOE) announced</a>\u2014well, if you can call slipping a note into its FAQ section an announcement.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCurrently, IBR forgiveness is paused while our systems are updated to accurately count months not affected by the court\u2019s injunction,\u201d the DOE states under a tab about processing IDR forgiveness. \u201cIBR forgiveness will resume once those updates are completed.\u201d However, it notes that loan forgiveness under the IBR is still being processed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s unclear when the program will start back up again. <em>Fast Company</em> reached out to the DOE for comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/22/student-loan-forgiveness-ibr-idr-trump\">Axios</a> and <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/23/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-ibr-explained\">CNN</a>, about two million individuals are reportedly enrolled in the IBR plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plans are also paused.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-save-can-t-be-saved\">SAVE can&#8217;t be saved</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This month has also marked the end of the fight to rescue former president Joe Biden&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91370415/trump-tax-bill-department-education-student-loans\">Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE)</a> plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump\u2019s so-called big, beautiful bill states that it must cease by July 2028, but it was already on its last legs. In February, an appeals court sided with a Republican-backed lawsuit that argued the Biden administration didn\u2019t have the authority to create it in the first place\u2014hence the injunction referenced in the DOE&#8217;s pause announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individuals enrolled in the SAVE plan have been in an <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91336862/confused-about-your-student-loan-status-heres-help\">interest-free forbearance</a> for over a year. Now, the roughly eight million borrowers on the SAVE plan will see interest accrue starting August 1. According to Student Aid, forbearance will continue \u201cuntil the legal situation changes or servicers are able to send bills to borrowers at the appropriate monthly amount.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Borrowers in SAVE, PAYE, or ICR plans who enroll in an IBR plan can count their payments toward forgiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Now, the truth of all their stories \u2014 one by one \u2014 will begin to be told. </p>\n\n<p>Starting here. </p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve compiled <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/venezuelan-immigrants-trump-deported-cecot/\">a first-of-its-kind, case-by-case accounting of 238 Venezuelan men who were held in El Salvador</a>.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>ProPublica, The Texas Tribune and a team of Venezuelan journalists from Alianza Rebelde Investiga (Rebel Alliance Investigates) and Cazadores de Fake News (Fake News Hunters) spent the past four months reporting on the men\u2019s lives and their backgrounds. We obtained government data that included whether they had been convicted of crimes in the U.S. or had pending charges. We found most were listed solely as having immigration violations. We also conducted interviews with relatives of more than 100 of the men; reviewed thousands of pages of court records from the U.S. and South America; and analyzed federal immigration court data.</p>\n\n<p>Some of our findings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>We obtained internal data showing that the Trump administration knew that at least 197 of the men had not been convicted of crimes in the U.S. \u2014 and that only six had been convicted of violent offenses. We identified fewer than a dozen additional convictions, both for crimes committed in the U.S. and abroad, that were not reflected in the government data.</p>\n\n</li>\n<li><p>Nearly half of the men, or 118, were whisked out of the country while in the middle of their immigration cases, which should have protected them from deportation. Some were only days away from a final hearing. </p>\n\n</li>\n<li><p>At least 166 of the men have tattoos. Interviews with families, immigration documents and court records show the government relied heavily on tattoos to tie the men to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua \u2014 even though law enforcement experts told us that tattoos are not an indicator of gang membership. </p>\n\n</li>\n<li><p>The men who were imprisoned range in age from 18 to 46. The impact of their monthslong incarceration extended beyond them. Their wives struggled to pay the rent. Relatives went without medical treatment. Their children wondered if they would see them again.</p>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson did not respond to questions about the men in the database but said Trump \u201cis committed to keeping his promises to the American people and removing dangerous criminal and terrorist illegals who pose a threat to the American public.\u201d She referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security, which did not respond. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/venezuelan-immigrants-trump-deported-cecot/\">Read the men\u2019s stories in our database.</a></p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Reporting by: <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/perla-trevizo\">Perla Trevizo</a>, ProPublica and The Texas Tribune; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/melissa-sanchez\">Melisa S\u00e1nchez</a>, ProPublica; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/mica-rosenberg\">Mica Rosenberg</a>, ProPublica; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/gabriel-sandoval\">Gabriel Sandoval</a>, ProPublica; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/jeff-ernsthausen\">Jeff Ernsthausen</a>, ProPublica; Ronna Risquez, Alianza Rebelde; Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, Cazadores de Fake News; Adriana N\u00fa\u00f1ez Moros, independent journalist; Carlos Centeno, independent journalist; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/maryam-jameel\">Maryam Jameel</a>, ProPublica; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/gerardo-del-valle\">Gerardo del Valle</a>, ProPublica; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/cengiz-yar\">Cengiz Yar</a>, ProPublica; Gabriel Pasquini, independent journalist; Kate Morrisey, independent journalist; Coral Murphy Marcos, independent journalist; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/lomi-kriel\">Lomi Kriel</a>, ProPublica and The Texas Tribune; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/nicole-foy\">Nicole Foy</a>, ProPublica; Rafael Carranza, Arizona Luminaria; <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/lisa-riordan-seville\">Lisa Seville</a>, ProPublica</p>\n<p>Design and development by: <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/ruth-talbot\">Ruth Talbot</a>, ProPublica</p>\n<p>Additional design and development by: <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/zisiga-mukulu\">Zisiga Mukulu</a>, ProPublica</p>\n<p>Additional data reporting by: <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/agnel-philip\">Agnel Philip</a>, ProPublica</p>",

    "title": "The Huawei Dilemma: Why Europe Needs Strong Intelligence Guardrails",
    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/huawei-spain-intelligence",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>Spain's recent decision to award Huawei a contract worth \u20ac12.3 million to manage and store legally authorized wiretaps raises significant concerns about the country's commitment to digital sovereignty. This move jeopardizes Spain\u2019s national security and undermines the trust that is essential for the intelligence-sharing frameworks of the European Union and NATO.</p><p>While Huawei has made considerable efforts to demonstrate technical compliance with European standards, the political reality is more complicated: any sensitive system it builds is, by default, subject to exploitation by Beijing. Huawei is subject to China\u2019s 2017 National Intelligence Law and cannot credibly claim complete independence from the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP\u2019s) security and intelligence apparatus. Despite this, Madrid\u2019s procurement process proceeded as if the controversy around Huawei had no bearing on the domain of sensitive state surveillance networks.</p><p>This episode highlights the lack of clear institutional safeguards in Europe and among transatlantic allies for assessing foreign vendors in critical intelligence systems. While the EU\u2019s 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox has guided member states regarding telecommunications infrastructure, there is no similar framework for the technologies that support law enforcement and intelligence operations. The result is fragmentation: some countries exclude Huawei on national security grounds, while others invite it to manage their surveillance backbones.</p><p>This divergence is not sustainable in an environment that requires intelligence sharing to stay ahead of adversaries.</p><p><strong>Spain\u2019s SITEL Contract is Effectively A Security Breach</strong></p><p>Spain\u2019s wiretap system, SITEL, functions as the core for Spanish law enforcement and intelligence wiretap activities, storing sensitive data about targets involved in terrorism, organized crime, and even foreign espionage.</p><p>Huawei is technically capable of managing such a system, but under China\u2019s 2017 National Intelligence Law, the company is compelled to cooperate with Chinese intelligence services. This creates a constant vulnerability in any critical infrastructure that Huawei or any PRC company operates abroad. However, Spain's procurement process treated Huawei's bid as if it were a neutral supplier.</p><p>Political factors have also shaped Madrid's decision. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez's government has aimed to strengthen economic ties with China, seeking investment and technological collaboration. This approach has caused Spain to clash with several EU states that have taken a more cautious stance toward Huawei in telecom infrastructure. There is also unease within Spain; reports indicate that officials from the national police and Guardia Civil have expressed concerns about depending on a Chinese vendor for such a sensitive role.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Sign up for the </strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>Cyber Initiatives Group</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

The country\u2019s cybersecurity agency later banned Huawei from 5G networks used in critical sectors after detecting unusual data traffic patterns at a Brussels telecom hub.</p><p>The \u201cGeneration\u201d bribery scandal worsened these concerns. Members of the European Parliament accepted lavish perks from lobbyists linked to Huawei, raising fears that influence operations had penetrated EU regulatory bodies. This incident eroded public trust and showed how corruption scandals can weaken vendor neutrality.</p><p>Belgium\u2019s swift and decisive response demonstrates a security-first approach, which should be adopted across the EU and transatlantic alliance. In contrast, Spain\u2019s SITEL contract indicates either a gap in awareness or a willingness to take risks that could affect Europe\u2019s shared security framework.</p><p><strong>Diverging National Paths Across Alliances</strong></p><p>The approach to Huawei varies further across Europe. Greece demonstrates how economic dependence can override security concerns \u2014 the country chose Huawei as a key provider for its telecommunications infrastructure. Huawei has even offered discounted equipment and \u201ctraining centers\u201d for Greek engineers to strengthen this relationship further. However, leaked documents in 2024 revealed that Huawei provided perks to Greek officials to secure these contracts.</p><p>Elsewhere in Europe, Huawei maintains a significant market share in Germany\u2019s 5G infrastructure despite pressure from the U.S. and the EU to choose a different path. Berlin adopted a pragmatic integration strategy and argued that excluding Huawei would incur prohibitive costs and delay 5G deployment. Germany has imposed limited restrictions on Huawei in specific networks, but the company nonetheless remains central to its telecom infrastructure.</p><p>These divergent national approaches illustrate Europe\u2019s fractured response. Greece and Germany focused on cost and speed, while Belgium emphasized national security, leaving the EU without a unified strategy.</p><p><strong>Conflict-Zone Dynamics</strong></p><p>Recent patterns emerging from conflict zones further emphasize the urgent need for a unified security policy. In Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, local populations and military operations are increasingly served by unauthorized mobile operators using Russian and potentially Chinese-supplied infrastructure. These networks\u2014established in Crimea, Donbas, and southern Ukraine\u2014are not only illegal under international law but also structurally opaque, enabling surveillance, population control, and disinformation on a large scale. Evidence indicates that Chinese vendors have been involved in providing equipment to these unauthorized operators, either directly or through intermediaries. In Crimea, for example, existing infrastructure was reportedly transformed using Russian intercept technology (SORM), raising concerns that Chinese equipment may have aided these transitions.</p><p>This reality exposes a significant blind spot in current EU and NATO frameworks. If hostile actors can take over infrastructure built with Chinese components during war, it is naive to think the same systems would stay secure during peacetime or under foreign pressure. The lesson is clear: infrastructure is deeply tied to geopolitical goals. Allowing vendors linked to authoritarian regimes to operate within the backbone of democratic intelligence or law enforcement systems not only compromises sovereignty but also offers adversarial regimes chances to exploit legal ambiguities and technical backdoors in moments of crisis.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

However, the alliance\u2019s guidance remains focused on telecommunications rather than surveillance and intelligence systems. This gap in oversight is significant. Intelligence-sharing within NATO depends on the secure handling of sensitive data. If one member state allows a high-risk vendor to operate its interception system, it creates a weakest-link problem that undermines trust. With adversaries mainly relying on hybrid threats, which exploit economic and technological channels to weaken the alliance, Huawei\u2019s presence in SITEL is a glaring vulnerability.</p><p><strong>Why Binding Guardrails Matter</strong></p><p>Intelligence sharing fundamentally depends on mutual assurances. The EU and NATO operate on the assumption that member states follow similar security standards. When one state diverges, it jeopardizes the effectiveness of the entire group. This creates a real risk, as adversaries can exploit these gaps to breach shared systems and compromise allied operations.</p><p>The debate over Huawei is not just about technology; it is about the integrity of Europe\u2019s intelligence infrastructure. Without enforceable standards, Europe\u2019s goals for strategic autonomy will be undermined by compromises and strategic divisions.</p><p>Policy Prescriptions: Binding EU & NATO Mechanisms</p><ol><li><strong>Codify Vendor Exclusion Policies:</strong> The European Commission should formalize its 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox from a voluntary framework into a binding directive, at least concerning intelligence infrastructure. This regulation must require the exclusion of vendors subject to foreign intelligence laws from operating within critical national security systems.</li><li><strong>Align NATO procurement standards:</strong> NATO must implement a collective security standard that requires member States to vet vendors for potential State influence and espionage risks.</li><li><strong>Support Member-State Transitions:</strong> For countries already relying on high-risk vendors, the EU and NATO should provide transition assistance to subsidize migration to trusted suppliers. This approach balances security needs with economic realities.</li><li><strong>Enhance Transparency in Intelligence Procurement:</strong> Member States should share sanitized risk assessments for major intelligence infrastructure contracts with other member State services whose security relies on them. Transparency enables allied oversight and strengthens democratic accountability.</li></ol><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Spain\u2019s Huawei contract highlights a deeper problem: the lack of binding standards to safeguard Europe\u2019s intelligence infrastructure. Procurement policy is a matter of national security. As hybrid threats grow and alliances face unprecedented pressure, EU and NATO leaders must act to address this critical gap. Without enforceable guidelines, the trust that underpins Europe\u2019s security framework is in jeopardy.</p><p>Europe\u2019s credibility hinges on its ability to align its intelligence infrastructure with alliance standards; otherwise, it risks increasing strategic division.</p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91012502/dry-january-branding-big-alcohol-heineken\">Top alcohol makers</a> have been sitting on the sidelines of a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90258035/the-la-croix-of-cannabis-the-marijuana-market-bets-on-beverages\">cannabis beverage</a> boom, watching brands in the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91227346/cannabis-brands-get-sneaky-with-tiktok-marketing-cann-seltzer\">fast-growing category like Cann</a> and Wynk make deals with beer and booze distributors, and gain valuable space on liquor store shelves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now some alcohol companies, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91018725/wine-industry-decline-gen-z-millennials-aging-drinkers\">seeing their sales falter</a>, are laying the groundwork to potentially enter the lucrative but risky market, a dozen founders of cannabis brands, ingredients suppliers and drinks manufacturers told Reuters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drinks containing THC, the mood-altering ingredient in marijuana, are restricted to licensed dispensaries in 24 U.S. states where <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91144396/new-york-citys-new-luxury-cannabis-stores-are-works-of-high-art\">recreational use of pot is legal</a>. But small amounts of THC can also be extracted from hemp, a crop that&#8217;s related to marijuana but is legal federally. Beverages containing THC derived from hemp can be sold in many liquor shops, convenience stores and supermarkets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s where Big Alcohol sees opportunity, despite some companies having been burned by past cannabis investments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corona brewer Constellation Brands has been internally researching hemp-based cannabis drinks to weigh its next steps, a source familiar with the company&#8217;s thinking said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolut vodka distiller Pernod Ricard has met with Brez, maker of drinks with THC derived from hemp, as recently as last month to discuss a possible investment, Brez&#8217;s founder Aaron Nosbisch said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They did not invest now but are circling,&#8221; Nosbisch said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pernod declined to comment on the meeting. Constellation Brands said it does not comment on rumors and speculation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alcohol makers are still suffering a hangover following <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90949919/this-is-how-covid-changed-the-way-americans-drink\">America&#8217;s pandemic drinking binge</a>, when sales spiked as cash-flush consumers splurged on pricey <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90485448/with-bars-and-restaurants-closed-boozing-at-home-is-booming\">bottles of liquor for their homes</a>, and then rushed back to bars when lockdown restrictions lifted. Alcohol sales have been falling ever since as inflation and interest rates rose and wallets became stretched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The companies also now face growing warnings from public health authorities who say drinking even small amounts of alcohol is associated with at least seven types of cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall U.S. beer volumes fell nearly 6% through May of this year, according to the Beer Institute. Volumes of spirits and wine sold in the same time period have declined by 5.6% and 9%, respectively, according to the Wine &amp; Spirits Wholesalers of America.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a sign of tumult in the industry, the CEO of the world&#8217;s biggest alcohol maker, Diageo, stepped down last week as the company struggles to revive growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But hemp-based drinks are expanding fast. The market for drinks infused with THC from hemp is projected to top $1 billion in sales this year, according to market research firm Euromonitor, and climb past $4 billion in 2028.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley told Reuters in January he&#8217;d be naive to say THC beverages aren&#8217;t having an effect &#8220;at least in a small way.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tilray Brands, the fourth-largest U.S. craft brewer with brands including Montauk and Shock Top, is selling its new hemp-derived THC seltzers through its beer distributors such as United Distributors in Georgia, executives told Reuters in an interview. The company&#8217;s THC drinks are for sale in 13 states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There\u2019s not a real leader that\u2019s taken ahold of the (market) so far, and that\u2019s what we look to do,&#8221; Tilray&#8217;s CEO Irwin Simon told Reuters earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others, including Heineken&#8217;s Lagunitas brand and Pabst Blue Ribbon, the fifth-largest U.S. brewer, have lent their names to THC seltzers for sale in dispensaries in California. Lagunitas is looking to grow distribution of its THC seltzer, potentially using hemp, to other states, a representative from Cannacraft, its ingredient supplier, said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A spokesperson for Lagunitas said it has no immediate plans to expand, but monitors market development and looks for opportunities as consumer tastes and regulations change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boston Beer, the maker of Sam Adams, is one of the brewers with the clearest path to eventually enter the U.S. cannabis drinks market although it has not provided a time frame for doing so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is already selling its Teapot brand of THC-infused tea in Canada where weed is legal, and in the last year tested a potential U.S. version made from THC derived from hemp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To test the reformulated product, a panel of trained sensory experts sampled Teapot with both THC from hemp and marijuana, and could not taste a difference, said the company&#8217;s head of cannabis, Paul Weaver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is a source of growth for our organization, flat out,&#8221; Weaver said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cautious-moves\">CAUTIOUS MOVES</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Big Alcohol is treading carefully in cannabis drinks because state and federal regulations have shifted, and could change again, said five executives at ingredients suppliers and THC beverage brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>California, which has legal weed, banned hemp-based drinks last year to try to prevent children from consuming them. Other states have introduced special taxes or restricted sales, ambiguity that has held alcohol companies back from entering the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Mitch McConnell, who helped first legalize hemp in 2018 to support farmers in his home state of Kentucky, in July introduced a provision in a government spending bill that could ban intoxicating products using the plant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McConnell wrote in an op-ed published in the Louisville Courier Journal on July 17 that his efforts are aimed at keeping THC gummies that look like familiar candies out of the hands of children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He did not provide comment beyond the op-ed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Big brewers have been burned by past cannabis investments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, the biggest U.S. brewer Anheuser-Busch inBev exited a deal with Tilray to research cannabis drinks in Canada. The same year, Molson Coors shuttered its U.S. business selling beverages infused with CBD, a compound in marijuana and hemp that does not have psychoactive effects, citing an uncertain regulatory environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Constellation Brands restructured its investment in Canadian cannabis company Canopy Growth last year after poor sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, however, hemp-based THC drinks are sold widely. Beyond beer&#8217;s declining sales, brewers face an additional squeeze from tariffs, which threaten to push up prices for imported drinks, and Hispanic consumers, who are staying home due to fears of U.S. immigration enforcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-high-margins\">HIGH MARGINS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquor stores are embracing the buzzy beverages to boost their margins as the drinks, typically more expensive than a six-pack of beer, start to outsell other types of alcohol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jon Halper, CEO of Minnesota liquor store chain Top Ten Liquors, told Reuters in June that THC beverages now make up 15% of his business after the company introduced them two years ago. By next year, they could grow to rival wine, currently in the mid twenty percent of his sales, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drinks take shelf space mostly from beer because they are in coolers, Halper said. The margins on cannabis beverages are higher than those for beer and spirits, helping his firm offset softening alcohol sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charleston, South Carolina-based Southern Horizon Logistics, a sister company of Budweiser distributor Southern Crown Partners, is now selling more hemp-based drinks than wine and spirits, said Justin Ashby, the company&#8217;s chief administrative officer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan Moses, CEO of Nashville, Tennessee-based beer, wine and spirits distributor Best Brands, said that growth from THC-infused drinks has helped offset flat and declining alcohol sales. Instead of possible layoffs, Moses has been able to re-allocate employees to the new category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It could be as big as the other categories five to 10 years from now,&#8221; Moses said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers like Josh Goldberg, 39, of Lindenhurst, New York, are also trading out beer and tequila for THC seltzers. Goldberg made the switch almost two years ago, and hasn&#8217;t had a drink since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It replaces the physical act of drinking with drinking something else,&#8221; Goldberg said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Halper, the owner of Minnesota liquor stores, said the customers buying THC-infused drinks tend to skew female and over the age of 35.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The soccer mom has really embraced the category in a big way,&#8221; Halper said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u2014Jessica DiNapoli and Emma Rumney, Reuters</em></p>",

Each year Dambo and his team make about 25 new trolls, which stand up to 40 feet (12 meters) tall.<br /><br />&#8220;I believe that we can make anything out of anything,&#8221; said Dambo, speaking from his farm outside Copenhagen. &#8220;We are drowning in trash. But we also know that one man&#8217;s trash is another man&#8217;s treasure.&#8221;<br /><br />An installation of six sculptures called &#8220;Trolls Save the Humans&#8221; is on display at Filoli, a historic estate with 650 acres of forests and gardens in Woodside, California, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of San Francisco.<br /><br />&#8220;They bring us back to be connected to the earth and to nature,&#8221; said Jeannette Weederman, who was visiting Filoli with her son in July.<br /><br />Dambo&#8217;s trolls each have their own personality and story. At Filoli, the troll Ibbi Pip builds birdhouses, Rosa Sunfinger plants flowers and Kamma Can makes jewelry from people&#8217;s garbage.<br /><br />&#8220;Each of them has a story to tell,&#8221; said Filoli CEO Kara Newport. &#8220;It inspires people to think of their own stories, what kind of creatures might live in their woods and make that connection to living beings in nature.&#8221;<br /><br />Dambo&#8217;s trolls don&#8217;t like humans because they waste nature&#8217;s resources and pollute the planet. The mythical creatures have a long-term perspective because they live for thousands of years and have witnessed the destructive force of human civilizations.<br /><br />But the six young trolls at Filoli have a more optimistic view of human nature. They believe they can teach people how to protect the environment.<br /><br />&#8220;They want to save the humans. So they do this by teaching them how to be better humans \u2014 be humans that don&#8217;t destroy nature,&#8221; said Dambo, 45, a poet and former hip-hop artist. &#8220;They hope to save them from being eaten by the older trolls.&#8221;<br /><br />Dambo&#8217;s trolls are hidden in forests, mountains, jungles and grasslands throughout Europe and North America as well as countries such as Australia, Chile and South Korea. Most were built with local materials and assembled on-site by his team of craftsmen and artists with help from local volunteers.<br /><br />&#8220;My exhibition now has four and a half million visitors a year globally, and it&#8217;s all made out of trash together with volunteers,&#8221; said Dambo. &#8220;That is such a huge proof of concept of why we should not throw things out, but why we should recycle it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u2014Terry Chea, Associated Press</em></p>",

    "description": "<p>At the new <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91372464/popcorn-bots-and-electric-sauce-what-to-know-about-elon-musks-tesla-diner\">Tesla Diner in Hollywood</a>, a retro-futuristic drive-in, you can catch a short film lasting about 30 minutes\u2014the typical length of a charging session at a Supercharger\u2014while you plug in your car. You can also get lunch (on the menu: a Tesla burger with \u201celectric sauce\u201d) while you use one of the 80 chargers on site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not the only attempt to reinvent the gas station in the age of electric cars. A startup called <a href=\"https://www.rovecharging.com/\">Rove</a> opened a charging center last year that includes a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91226613/electric-vehicles-gas-stations-charging-infrastructure\">lounge where drivers can pull out their laptops and catch up on work</a>. <a href=\"https://www.ionna.com/\">Ionna</a>, a coalition formed by automakers, is building \u201cRechargery\u201d sites that also include <a href=\"https://theevreport.com/ionna-launches-first-ev-rechargery-in-north-carolina\">lounges and coffee</a>. The concept is simple: If it takes longer to charge an <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/evs\" title=\"EVs\">EV</a> than to pump gas, gas stations need to become a better place to hang out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this probably isn\u2019t the future of EV charging\u2014or only a small part of it. Elon Musk has said that he wants to build a network of new diners if the Hollywood location is a success. (Don\u2019t hold your breath: It took seven years for Tesla to build the one that just opened.) It could be helpful as an interim solution. But most EV charging will ultimately look different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, faster charging is on the horizon. In China, BYD is rolling out EVs with <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91303128/chinas-new-evs-can-charge-in-5-minutes\">batteries designed to charge in five or six minutes</a>, and building a network of ultra-fast chargers to support the vehicles. Solid-state batteries, under development now, will also enable fast charging when they eventually come to market. If faster-charging battery technology becomes widespread, the typical gas station model wouldn\u2019t have to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s more likely, though, that gas stations will become less and less important, as charging becomes embedded everywhere else. Already, around 80% to 90% of EV drivers in the U.S. charge at home most of the time. It\u2019s more convenient than going out of your way to a charging station. It\u2019s cheaper. It\u2019s also better for your car\u2019s battery\u2014and the electric grid\u2014to charge slowly, over hours rather than minutes. (New tech may help batteries degrade less with fast charging, but the power demand from chargers is still a challenge for the grid.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For EV owners who live in apartments, shared chargers in garages are becoming more common, so they also have the option to charge at night. <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90930093/itselectric-curbside-chargers-urban-ev-ownership\">Curbside chargers on streets</a> are also beginning to roll out in some cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If drivers plugged in at work, and slowly charged during the day, the network of cars could <a href=\"https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2023/04/strategic-ev-charging-could-eliminate-the-need-for-costly-new-infrastructure/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=1618338427&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADqM5AESCFQsyowyUjfx0d0lBHAIn&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw7fzDBhA7EiwAOqJkh2dFQvBdBExJ1Ow5KYBZXWrRNFji_v0XfoHAlZBdvZmUqS-RUuVd7hoCWKYQAvD_BwE\">help store extra solar power</a> without the need to build as much large-scale battery storage infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when someone needs a fast charge, that can happen at the places they already go. Some stores have had EV chargers for years, and more retailers keep rolling them out. Starbucks is building chargers at some stores. Fast food chains from Dunkin&#8217; to Chick-fil-A have started adding chargers at some locations. Walmart plans to install chargers at thousands of its stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cars spend 95% of their time parked. And unlike gas cars, EVs don&#8217;t need supervision while they&#8217;re refueling, so they can take advantage of that unused time. Instead of creating entertainment for new charging stations, maybe we just need to keep adding more chargers to the places where cars already park.</p>",

Jefferson Parish Sheriff Joseph Lopinto said during his testimony in the March trial over Arnold\u2019s lawsuit that Alvarado\u2019s commanders instructed him against writing such a report after video of his actions spread across social media.</p>\n\n<p>Arnold\u2019s run-in with Alvarado, which was captured in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_5arYnINQ&amp;t=22s\">14-second video</a>, left the woman with bruises and scratches across her body, a busted lip and recurring headaches, according to her subsequent account to police investigators.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHad it not been for a bystander capturing how this officer beat up Shantel Arnold, there would be no report, there would be no evidence of it, there would be no indication that it ever happened,\u201d Carter said in a recent interview.</p>\n\n<p>The new law, passed unanimously by state legislators and signed by Gov. Jeff Landry in June, will <a href=\"https://legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1426023\">require all law enforcement agencies</a> to report every time an officer\u2019s use of force results in serious injury. It directs the Council on Peace Officer Standards and Training, which certifies police officers, to adopt a policy on mandatory use-of-force reporting by Jan. 1. Details of how the process will work have not been spelled out, nor has the penalty for failing to comply.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The bill was introduced as \u201c<a href=\"https://legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1414416\">Shantel Arnold\u2019s Law</a>,\u201d but Carter said that name was removed because \u201cSheriff Lopinto got very upset about that, and that almost killed the bill.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Neither the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office nor Alvarado\u2019s attorney responded to requests for comment or an interview.</p>\n\n<p>Alvarado came across Arnold in September 2021, when the officer responded to a 911 call about a fight among 25 people in Jefferson Parish. When the deputy pulled up in his patrol car, Alvarado saw Arnold, covered in dirt, walking down the street. Arnold told the deputy she was attacked by a group of boys who frequently bullied her. When Alvarado ordered her to stop, Arnold said she just wanted to go home and kept walking. That\u2019s when the deputy jumped out of his vehicle, grabbed Arnold and slammed her into the sidewalk, according to several witnesses.</p>\n\n<p>In a video taken by a bystander, Alvarado drags Arnold along the pavement, holds her by her braids and slams her repeatedly onto the pavement. Arnold was not charged with a crime and was later taken to a hospital. The Sheriff\u2019s Office did not use body cameras at the time but has since begun using them.</p>\n\n<p>The Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office denied wrongdoing. A <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/jefferson-parish-sheriff-deputy-alvarado-lopinto\">2022 internal investigation</a> by the Sheriff\u2019s Office determined Alvarado\u2019s actions against Arnold were \u201cboth reasonable and acceptable.\u201d Alvarado received an \u201capproximately\u201d 40-hour suspension for failing to file a written report, Lopinto said in his March testimony.</p>\n\n<p>Arnold alleged in her 2022 lawsuit that the Sheriff\u2019s Office knew Alvarado had a propensity for violence against Black people and other minority groups yet continued to have him patrol such communities, putting the public in danger.</p>\n\n<p>Lopinto attributed Alvarado\u2019s history of complaints to his working a high-crime beat, according to a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/jefferson-parish-sheriff-deputy-alvarado-lopinto\">2022 Times-Picayune interview</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s getting a complaint every month,\u201d Lopinto said. During that same interview, Lopinto dismissed Arnold\u2019s account and accused her of \u201clooking for a paycheck.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Alvarado\u2019s alleged misdeeds fit a broader pattern in the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office, as the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/series/unwatched\">yearlong investigation into the Sheriff\u2019s Office</a> by ProPublica, WRKF and WWNO found. Between 2013 and 2021, deputies disproportionately discharged guns against Black people. Of the 40 people shot at by Jefferson Parish deputies during that time, 73% were Black, more than double their share of the population. Twelve of the 16 people who died after being shot or restrained by deputies during that time were Black.</p>\n\n<p>Alvarado has been named in at least 10 federal civil rights lawsuits since 2007, all involving the use of excessive force; eight of the plaintiffs were members of minority groups. </p>\n\n<p>The Sheriff\u2019s Office settled three of those lawsuits. Arnold\u2019s $300,000 payout is the third \u2014 and largest \u2014 settlement involving Alvarado. Five other lawsuits were closed in favor of the Sheriff\u2019s Office, one was dismissed on a legal technicality and one was indefinitely delayed.</p>\n\n<p>The Sheriff\u2019s Office said in filings responding to the eight lawsuits that were not dismissed or delayed that officers\u2019 actions were \u201creasonable under the circumstances\u201d and characterized the claims as \u201cfrivolous.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Prior to the 2021 incident involving Arnold, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office had settled a 2016 lawsuit accusing Alvarado of grabbing a 14-year-old Hispanic boy by the neck and slamming his head against the concrete as the child screamed, \u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d A woman had called the police complaining that the boy and a friend were wrestling in a parking lot. Alvarado then threatened to have the boy and his family deported, according to the suit. The Sheriff\u2019s Office, which paid the boy\u2019s family $15,000, said in court filings that Alvarado\u2019s actions were \u201creasonable under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In 2018, another lawsuit claimed Alvarado and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/if-everybodys-white-there-cant-be-any-racial-bias-the-disappearance-of-hispanic-drivers-from-traffic-records\">three deputies beat Atdner Casco</a>, a Honduran native, and stole more than $2,000 from him during a traffic stop the year before, then conspired to have him deported. Casco claimed Alvarado beat and choked him until he agreed to keep silent about being robbed. The Sheriff\u2019s Office denied wrongdoing but settled that case in 2020 for $50,000.</p>\n\n<p>Both incidents were cited in Arnold\u2019s lawsuit as evidence that Alvarado has exhibited a pattern of behavior throughout his career that made him unfit for duty. Carter, Arnold\u2019s attorney, raised yet another incident during the March trial in which sheriff detectives in December 2019 witnessed Alvarado patronizing a massage parlor that was being investigated for suspected prostitution. Alvarado denied he went there to \u201chave a sexual act performed on him.\u201d He was demoted from sergeant to deputy for \u201cbringing the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office in disrepute\u201d and for patronizing an \u201cillegitimate business while on duty and neglecting your responsibilities to detectives under your command,\u201d Carter said during the trial, citing an internal police report.</p>\n\n<p>Carter said in an interview that Lopinto\u2019s continued defense and employment of Alvarado represented a permissive attitude toward questionable behavior.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe stood by\u201d Alvarado, who \u201cshows no contrition, no remorse,\u201d Carter said.</p>",

    "description": "<p>An <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91223897/how-a-new-trump-administration-will-treat-the-budding-ai-industry\">artificial intelligence agenda</a> that started coalescing on the podcasts of <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91257772/trump-inauguration-big-tech-donations-list-google-microsoft-meta-apple\">Silicon Valley billionaires</a> is now being forged into U.S. policy as <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91334493/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-could-sideline-state-ai-protections-for-a-decade\">President Donald Trump</a> leans on the ideas of the tech figures who <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91258169/tech-ceos-trump-administration-ai-crypto\">backed his election campaig</a>n.<br /><br />Trump on Wednesday is planning to reveal an &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> Action Plan&#8221; he ordered after returning to the White House in January. He gave his tech advisers six months to come up with new AI policies after revoking President Joe Biden&#8217;s signature AI guardrails on his first day in office.<br /><br />The unveiling is co-hosted by the bipartisan Hill and Valley Forum and the All-In Podcast, a business and technology show hosted by four tech investors and entrepreneurs who include Trump&#8217;s AI czar, David Sacks.<br /><br />The plan and related executive orders are expected to include some familiar tech lobby pitches. That includes accelerating the sale of AI technology abroad and making it easier to construct the energy-hungry data center buildings that are needed to form and run AI products, according to a person briefed on Wednesday&#8217;s event who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.<br /><br />It might also include some of the AI culture war preoccupations of the circle of venture capitalists who endorsed Trump last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-blocking-woke-ai-from-tech-contractors\">Blocking &#8216;woke AI&#8217; from tech contractors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Countering the liberal bias they see in AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google&#8217;s Gemini has long been a rallying point for the tech industry&#8217;s loudest Trump backers.<br /><br />Sacks, a former PayPal executive and now Trump&#8217;s top AI adviser, has been criticizing &#8220;woke AI&#8221; for more than a year, fueled by Google&#8217;s February 2024 rollout of an AI image generator that, when asked to show an American Founding Father, created pictures of Black, Latino and Native American men.<br /><br />&#8220;The AI&#8217;s incapable of giving you accurate answers because it&#8217;s been so programmed with diversity and inclusion,&#8221; Sacks said at the time. Google quickly fixed its tool, but the &#8220;Black George Washington&#8221; moment remained a parable for the problem of AI&#8217;s perceived political bias, taken up by X owner Elon Musk, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Vice President JD Vance and Republican lawmakers.<br /><br />The administration&#8217;s latest push against &#8220;woke AI&#8221; comes a week after the Pentagon announced new $200 million contracts with four leading AI companies, including Google, to address &#8220;critical national security challenges.&#8221;<br /><br />Also receiving one of the contracts was Musk&#8217;s xAI, which has been pitched as an alternative to &#8220;woke AI&#8221; companies. The company has faced its own challenges: Earlier this month, xAI had to scramble to remove posts made by its Grok chatbot that made antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-streamlining-ai-data-center-permits\">Streamlining AI data center permits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has paired AI&#8217;s need for huge amounts of electricity with his own push to tap into U.S. energy sources, including gas, coal and nuclear.<br /><br />&#8220;Everything we aspire to and hope for means the demand and supply of energy in America has to go up,&#8221; said Michael Kratsios, the director of the White House&#8217;s Office of Science and Technology Policy, in a video posted Tuesday.<br /><br />Many tech giants are already well on their way toward building new data centers in the U.S. and around the world. OpenAI announced this week that it has switched on the first phase of a massive data center complex in Abilene, Texas, part of an Oracle-backed project known as Stargate that Trump promoted earlier this year. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and xAI also have major projects underway.<br /><br />The tech industry has pushed for easier permitting rules to get their computing facilities connected to power, but the AI building boom has also contributed to spiking demand for fossil fuel production that will contribute to global warming.<br /><br />United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday called on the world&#8217;s major tech firms to power data centers completely with renewables by 2030.<br /><br />&#8220;A typical AI data center eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes,&#8221; Guterres said. &#8220;By 2030, data centers could consume as much electricity as all of Japan does today.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-new-approach-to-ai-exports\">A new approach to AI exports?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s long been White House policy under Republican and Democratic administrations to curtail certain technology exports to China and other adversaries on national security grounds.<br /><br />But much of the tech industry argued that Biden went too far at the end of his term in trying to restrict the exports of specialized AI computer chips to more than 100 other countries, including close allies.<br /><br />Part of the Biden administration&#8217;s motivation was to stop China from acquiring coveted AI chips in third-party locations such as Southeast Asia or the Middle East, but critics said the measures would end up encouraging more countries to turn to China&#8217;s fast-growing AI industry instead of the U.S. as their technology supplier.<br /><br />It remains to be seen how the Trump administration aims to accelerate the export of U.S.-made AI technologies while countering China&#8217;s AI ambitions. California chipmakers Nvidia and AMD both announced last week that they won approval from the Trump administration to sell to China some of their advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence.<br /><br />AMD CEO Lisa Su is among the guests planning to attend Trump&#8217;s event Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-who-benefits-from-trump-s-ai-action-plan\">Who benefits from Trump&#8217;s AI action plan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are sharp debates on how to regulate AI, even among the influential venture capitalists who have been debating it on their favorite medium: the podcast.<br /><br />While some Trump backers, particularly Andreessen, have advocated an &#8220;accelerationist&#8221; approach that aims to speed up AI advancement with minimal regulation, Sacks has described himself as taking a middle road of techno-realism.<br /><br />&#8220;Technology is going to happen. Trying to stop it is like ordering the tides to stop. If we don&#8217;t do it, somebody else will,&#8221; Sacks said on the All-In podcast.<br /><br />On Tuesday, 95 groups including labor unions, parent groups, environmental justice organizations and privacy advocates signed a resolution opposing Trump&#8217;s embrace of industry-driven AI policy and calling for a &#8220;People&#8217;s AI Action Plan&#8221; that would &#8220;deliver first and foremost for the American people.&#8221;<br /><br />Amba Kak, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute, which helped lead the effort, said the coalition expects Trump&#8217;s plan to come &#8220;straight from Big Tech&#8217;s mouth.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Every time we say, &#8216;What about our jobs, our air, water, our children?&#8217; they&#8217;re going to say, &#8216;But what about China?'&#8221; she said in a call with reporters Tuesday. She said Americans should reject the White House&#8217;s argument that the industry is overregulated and fight to preserve &#8220;baseline protections for the public&#8221; as AI technology advances.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Associated Press writer Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u2014Matt O&#8217;Brien and Ali Swenson, Associated Press</em></p>",

As one man commented on the original TikTok video, \u201cBut have you been a man in NYC who tries to talk to a girl at a bar?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it might not be the meet cute they had in mind, at the very least the TikTok shows people are keen to put themselves out there.

From Birmingham\u2019s grimy streets, he forged heavy metal with Black Sabbath\u2019s doom-laden riffs, reshaping rock forever. His voice \u2013 raw, haunted, unforgettable \u2013 became the soundtrack of rebellion and existential dread. Offstage, he was chaos incarnate: biting bats, snorting ants, and turning scandal into legend. Fired by Sabbath, he returned with Crazy Train, proving he was both survivor and showman. His final concert at Villa Park, days before his death at 76, was a thunderous farewell. Ozzy didn\u2019t just live rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 he weaponised it.",

    "title": "The Microsoft SharePoint breach was massive. The response has been minimal",
    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91373183/microsoft-sharepoint-breach-response-minimal",
    "description": "<p>It\u2019s not every day that U.S. nuclear facilities, the Department for Education, and governments across Europe and the Middle East are breached in a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91371597/microsoft-sharepoint-hack-servers-emergency-patches-update\">single hack</a>. But then again, the vulnerability identified in Microsoft\u2019s document collaboration tool, SharePoint, this weekend isn\u2019t your ordinary issue. It has found a chink in the armor of one of the most widely used suites of software across the world. Microsoft holds a <a href=\"https://6sense.com/tech/document-collaboration/microsoft-sharepoint-market-share\">two-thirds market share</a> in the business <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/productivity\" title=\"Productivity\">productivity</a> space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft disclosed the vulnerability in a <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/\">blog post</a> over the weekend, clarifying that the issue only affected on-premises SharePoint servers. These are locally hosted instances of the collaboration tool, rather than the more broadly used SharePoint Online system in Microsoft 365. The company rolled out updates to plug the hole in security, which it said customers \u201cshould apply [. . .] immediately to ensure they are protected.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dozens of large organizations are known to have already been affected, including U.S. and international governments, and were hacked through the vulnerability. The breach has left some wondering why the reaction has been so muted, given the high-profile targets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Darren Guccione, CEO and cofounder of Keeper Security, notes that although Microsoft 365\u2019s cloud-based services are unaffected, many critical sectors\u2014including government, legal, and financial institutions\u2014still depend on older or hybrid SharePoint setups. These systems, he says, often \u201clack the visibility, access control and agility\u201d needed to respond quickly with security updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some cybersecurity experts say the response so far hasn\u2019t reflected the seriousness of the threat. Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity professor at the University of Surrey, points out that the issue impacts on-premise installations rather than Microsoft-hosted ones. As a result, he explains, Microsoft\u2019s role is limited to releasing a fix, leaving the rest up to organizations themselves. The company, he says, has essentially told users: \u201cOver to you if you operate and maintain your own servers\u2019 instance of SharePoint.\u201d (Microsoft did not immediately respond to <em>Fast Company</em>&#8216;s request to comment.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those servers are often held offline because they are used to store sensitive data, including in the delivery of government services, which isn&#8217;t trusted to be stored in cloud environments. \u201cThe awkward part of the story is that there are still several hundred thousand share points on premises,\u201d Woodward says. \u201cIt could be a double-whammy if it\u2019s not handled properly.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woodward says he\u2019s been struck by the lack of urgency in the broader IT community\u2019s response\u2014including from Microsoft itself. Given the severity of the vulnerability, he expected the company to be far more vocal in alerting its technical user base. Microsoft, he says, should have been \u201cshouting about it.\u201d Meanwhile, both the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/07/20/update-microsoft-releases-guidance-exploitation-sharepoint-vulnerabilities\">U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a> (CISA) and <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/active-exploitation-of-vulnerability-affecting-microsoft-office-sharepoint-server-products-in-the-uk\">U.K. National Cyber Security Center</a> (NCSC) have issued warnings about the risks of the vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other experts are more sympathetic to Microsoft\u2019s situation. \u201cI have some sympathy for all parties here,\u201d says Craig Clark, director of Clark &amp; Company Information Services, a cybersecurity advisor. \u201cThreats are evolving at such a rate that it\u2019s almost impossible to keep up.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clark does admit that \u201cMicrosoft needs to be more dynamic in how it issues its advisories and remember that many security teams are small and perhaps more needs to be done to keep people better informed,\u201d he says. But the relationship goes both ways. \u201cFor their part, security teams need the resources to ensure that patching is seen as more than just a nice to have,\u201d he says. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Clark\u2019s key concerns is how quickly attackers are now able to weaponize newly discovered vulnerabilities\u2014something he attributes to rapid advancements in technology, particularly <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a>. He warns that threat actors are increasingly leveraging these tools to accelerate attacks, which will likely make incidents like this more frequent. Microsoft has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-22/microsoft-says-chinese-hackers-exploiting-sharepoint-flaws?srnd=phx-technology\">already confirmed</a> that Chinese state-sponsored hackers have exploited the flaw. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fixing the problem long-term will be more complex, experts say. Clark advises layering security measures, isolating critical systems, and automating patching wherever possible. Ultimately, he says, organizations \u201cneed to move away from the patch when we can.\u201d Still, what works in theory often falls short in practice\u2014which is why such vulnerabilities continue to surface.</p>",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91372305/wall-street-global-markets-tariffs\">Global shares</a> rallied on Wednesday, with Tokyo&#8217;s benchmark Nikkei 225 index gaining 3.5% after <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91327537/japan-finance-minister-us-treasury-holdings-card-trump-tariff-talks\">Japan</a> and the U.S. announced a deal on <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91364101/trump-tariffs-japan-south-korea\">President Donald Trump&#8217;s tariffs</a>.<br /><br />France&#8217;s CAC 40 added 1.4% in early trading to 7,854.75, while Germany&#8217;s DAX gained 0.9% to 24,260.62. Britain&#8217;s FTSE 100 rose 0.6% to 9,075.46. The future for the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.4% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5%.<br /><br />The tariff agreement as announced calls for a 15% U.S. import duty on goods from Japan, apart from certain products such as <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91345871/trumps-50-tariffs-steel-aluminum-imminent-heres-what-know\">steel and aluminum</a> that are subject to much higher tariffs. That&#8217;s down from the 25% Trump had said would kick in on Aug. 1 if a deal was not reached.<br /><br />&#8220;This Deal will create Hundreds of Thousands of Jobs \u2014 There has never been anything like it,&#8221; Trump posted on Truth Social, noting that Japan was also investing &#8220;at my direction&#8221; $550 billion into the U.S. He said Japan would &#8220;open&#8221; its economy to American autos and rice.<br /><br />Japan&#8217;s benchmark Nikkei 225 surged as much as 3.7%, closing at 41,171.32.<br /><br />Hong Kong&#8217;s Hang Seng jumped 1.6% to 25,538.07, while the Shanghai Composite index was little changed, gaining less than 0.1% to 3,582.30.<br /><br />Australia&#8217;s S&amp;P/ASX 200 edged up 0.7% to 8,737.20 and the Kospi in South Korea edged 0.4% higher to 3,183.77.<br /><br />&#8220;President Trump has signed two trade deals this week with the Philippines and Japan which is likely to keep market sentiment propped up despite deals with the likes of the EU and South Korea remaining elusive, for now at least,&#8221; Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at Kohle Capital Markets, said in a report.<br /><br />There was a chorus of no comments from the Japanese automakers, despite the latest announcement, including Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Corp.<br /><br />Japanese companies tend to be cautious about their public reactions, and some business officials have privately remarked in off-record comments that they hesitate to say anything because Trump keeps changing his mind.<br /><br />The Japan Automobile Manufacturers&#8217; Association also said it had no comment, noting there was no official statement yet. Japan&#8217;s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba welcomed the agreement as beneficial to both sides.<br /><br />Toyota stock jumped 14% in Tokyo trading, while Honda was up more than 11% and Nissan added 8%. In other sectors, Nippon Steel, which is acquiring U.S. Steel, rose 2.7% while video game maker and significant exporter Nintendo Co. added 0.7%. Sony Group surged 4.3%.<br /><br />But Takeshi Niinami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, which groups about 1,600 top executives, issued a note of caution about the nation having to be resilient and pushing free trade, while welcoming the tariff deal.<br /><br />&#8220;I hope this U.S.-Japan tariff deal can work as a starting point to further strengthen U.S.-Japan relations,&#8221; he said.<br /><br />He noted the U.S. policy of putting America first was unlikely to change, and that meant Japan, too, must make policy adjustments, such as making an aggressive push in <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">artificial intelligence</a>.<br /><br />Trump has also said that he reached a trade agreement with the Philippines following a meeting Tuesday at the White House, that will see the U.S. slightly drop its tariff rate for the Philippines without paying import taxes for what it sells there.<br /><br />On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 added 0.1% to Monday&#8217;s all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.4%.<br /><br />Also early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 23 cents to $65.08 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard fell 21 cents to $68.38 a barrel.<br /><br />The U.S. dollar fell to 146.38 Japanese yen from 146.64 yen. The euro cost $1.1736, down from $1.1754.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u2014Yuri Kageyama, AP Business Writer</em></p>",

Then who could forget the dalgona coffee trend that had TikTok in a choke hold back in 2020.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the novelty of drinking your morning cup of coffee from a plastic bucket is likely driving the trend, <em>Snaxshot</em>\u2019s Andrea Hern\u00e1ndez <a href=\"https://open.substack.com/users/14288677-snaxshot?utm_source=mentions\">suggests</a> it may be reflective of a broader shift in attitudes toward caffeine. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of experiencing that sort of backlash from what we were trying to do, like, less caffeine, more mindfulness, more meditation, less palpitations,\u201d she told <em>The Times</em>.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than paying attention to wellness gurus who claim coffee first thing in the morning disrupts cortisol levels, or giving in to Big Matcha, the pendulum has swung back to mainlining caffeine by the bucketload.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, considering a regular-size oat cap is pushing $10 with tip, $12 for 34 ounces of latte is arguably a great deal.\u00a0</p>\n<hr />",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91373076/krispy-kreme-gopro-kohls-stock-price-today-memes",
    "description": "<p>Over the past several days, the share prices of three companies have surged 25% or more in a single trading session. Those companies are Krispy Kreme, GoPro, and Kohl\u2019s. Yet none of these firms have made any major announcements of late that support such lofty rises in their stock prices. So why are their share prices skyrocketing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like meme stock mania is back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-a-meme-stock\">What is a meme stock?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The term \u201cmeme stock\u201d <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90832078/rip-meme-stocks-bed-bath-beyond-bankruptcy-bubble\">first gained popularity</a> during the early pandemic years. During the 2020\u20132021 period, many people were confined indoors due to lockdowns or a general fear of going out, so they turned to the internet to pass the time, often taking on new digital hobbies or joining new communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many, a new hobby emerged: online investing. As a result, many of these new investors turned to social media for advice on which stocks to buy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most popular social media community for stock advice was the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, and it is in this community where many consider meme stock mania to have originated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A meme stock is generally defined as a stock that is promoted by members of an online community, such as the one found in the r/wallstreetbets subreddit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proponents of a meme stock buy shares of a stock at a low price\u2014often in struggling companies with some brand name awareness\u2014and then promote it, attempting to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/meme-stock-5206762\">build hype and a positive narrative</a> about the stock, as noted by Investopedia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is to get in on the meme stock while the price is low, see the value surge as more people who are afraid of missing out on a 10x or 100x bagger buy into the stock, and then often to get out of the stock before the hype collapses and the shares crash again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Reuters points out, meme stocks are <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/highly-shorted-krispy-kreme-gopro-101134199.html\">often heavily shorted</a>. The rise in share prices for these stocks force investors who had bet against the stock to sell their shares to limit their losses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early pandemic years, two of the most popular meme stocks were the struggling video game retailer GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, as of this week, there\u2019s a new trio of meme stocks sending a frenzy through online trading communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-krispy-kreme\">Krispy Kreme</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably the most well-known meme stock among the new trio is Krispy Kreme (Nasdaq: DNUT), the donut company that <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91370676/krispy-kreme-88-cent-dozen-donuts-rules-today-get-birthday-deal\">loves giving away tasty treats</a>. Over the past day or so, people have been <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1m6l36r/dd_the_value_play_cycle_needs_its_third_why_im/\">talking up DNUT stock</a> on social media, and as a result, Krispy Kreme shares have surged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday, Krispy Kreme\u2019s stock price jumped a staggering 26% in a single trading session. DNUT stock went up 87 cents per share to close at $4.13.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And today the stock is surging again in premarket trading, as of the time of this writing. DNUT shares are currently up another 25%.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-gopro\">GoPro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another moderately well-known brand name is also the newest meme stock. GoPro, Inc. (Nasdaq: GPRO), maker of the tiny portable cameras that are popular with extreme sports enthusiasts, saw its shares blast off yesterday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Tuesday\u2019s trading session, GPRO shares leaped an asounting 41%. The company\u2019s stock price went up 39 cents per share to $1.37 by market close.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And today, GPRO stock is trending even higher. As of the time of this writing, in premarket trading, GoPro shares are up another 56% to $2.14 per share.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-kohl-s\">Kohl\u2019s</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The third meme stock in this latest trinity is Kohl&#8217;s Corporation (NYSE: KSS). The clothing retailer\u2019s shares jumped a massive 37% yesterday in a single trading session. During the period, KSS shares climbed $3.92 to $14.34. The volatility led to trading being <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/22/kohls-shares-rise-amid-short-interest-reddit-posts.html\">temporarily halted</a>, as CNBC reported. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as of premarket trading this morning, KSS shares aren\u2019t having continued gains. The stock is currently trading flat in premarket, according to data from Yahoo Finance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fast Company</em> reached out to Krispy Kreme, GoPro, and Kohl&#8217;s for comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-cautionary-tale\">A cautionary tale</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard not to see single-day gains of 25% to 50% in a stock and not feel the urge to buy in. However, most financial advisers would advise against buying into a meme stock as they are considered a relatively high-risk investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s because meme stocks see their prices surge due to the hype online communities build up around that stock, not due to any firm fundamentals of the company itself. This online hype often leads many to buy into the stock, causing its price to surge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if the fundamentals of a company do not support the stock\u2019s price, the stock will most likely crash, and investors who got in at the wrong time could see their entire investment washed away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take one of the most popular meme stocks in history, for example. People went crazy for AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) in December 2020. That month, the stock was trading for around a low of $20, according to Yahoo Finance data. But then meme mania bit, and by June 2021, AMC shares were over $566 each.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet by the next month, AMC shares had declined to $370 apiece, and by December 2021, they were in the low $40s. As of yesterday\u2019s close, AMC shares are worth $3.50 each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesson here is that meme stocks can surge in price rapidly, but they can fall just as rapidly, too. &nbsp;</p>",

Three months ago, when he was still allied with Trump, Musk said he was pulling back from working in the president&#8217;s administration. Founding the party has rekindled worries that Musk will be distracted from business as it faces mounting competition, especially in its key China market, and as he tries to turn Tesla into a robotics and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk said on Sunday that he was back to working seven days a week and sleeping in the office when his small children were away.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-fast-can-robotaxi-services-expand\">HOW FAST CAN ROBOTAXI SERVICES EXPAND?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, Tesla launched a small trial of its self-driving taxi service in Austin, Texas, with roughly a dozen of its Model Y SUVs and several restrictions, including safety supervisors in front passenger seats. Tesla enthusiasts lauded the efforts, although videos showed some driving mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk has said the service would reach the San Francisco Bay Area &#8220;in a month or two,&#8221; depending on regulatory approvals, but Tesla has not applied for necessary permits to test or deploy driverless vehicles, regulators in California told Reuters this month. Investors will want to know how the expansion can go forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-where-is-the-cheaper-tesla\">WHERE IS THE CHEAPER TESLA?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When Musk shifted his focus to robotaxis, he cancelled plans to build a new, cheaper EV platform. Tesla had promised to start producing the first of more affordable EV models by the end of June, but the company has not yet confirmed if it has met that target. Investors are keen for an update on those plans. Sources had told Reuters in April that a stripped-down version of the Model Y was likely to be delayed by months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts have already cut their 2025 delivery estimate for the cheaper car to below 50,000 vehicles, from 63,500 at the start of the year, according to eight of them polled by Visible Alpha.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-the-model-y-refresh-boost-sales\">CAN THE MODEL Y REFRESH BOOST SALES?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla rolled out a refreshed version of the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91183098/tesla-s-plans-revealed-new-variant-model-y-ev\">Model Y</a> this year, a move investors hoped would recharge flagging sales. Deliveries of the SUV and its Model 3 compact sedan \u2014 Tesla&#8217;s volume drivers \u2014 plunged in the second quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Tesla blamed a January production pause to retool plants, some analysts have said the re-styling \u2014 including new front and rear light bars and a touchscreen for back-seat passengers \u2014 was not enough to boost demand. Investors will want to know Musk&#8217;s view of the rollout to date and going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With total deliveries falling 13.5% to 384,122 units in the second quarter, the second straight quarterly decline, revenue is expected to fall 11.2% year-on-year, despite aggressive discounting and low-cost financing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-soon-will-regulatory-credits-dwindle\">HOW SOON WILL REGULATORY CREDITS DWINDLE?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sales of regulatory credits \u2014 a silent profit engine for Tesla \u2014 are set to dry up after <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91264729/trump-ends-ev-subsidies-whats-next\">recent legislation</a>. Tesla earned $2.8 billion in 2024 from such credits sold to legacy automakers to help them comply with emissions rules. Without them, the company would have reported a loss in the first quarter of this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts expect pressure on Tesla and they are already resetting their revenue estimates for the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u2014Akash Sriram and Abhirup Roy, Reuters</em></p>",

Rumors also circulated that his running mate, Hsiao Bi-khim, had misrepresented the status of her U.S. citizenship, falsely <a href=\"https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.34749EQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">claiming</a> to have renounced it to meet the eligibility requirements for office.</p><p>Earlier this summer, videos were posted to social media platforms purporting to show President Lai promoting questionable cryptocurrency investments. Other anti-unification figures are shown in blurry-mouthed clips boasting about the government\u2019s role in developing digital currency software. Other clips that went viral insist that the government in Taipei is undergoing a secret operation to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67891869\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">harvest</a> the blood of its citizens so that the United States can create a bioweapon to attack China.</p><p>Every day, social media feeds in Taiwan are flooded with a mix of sensational and carefully-crafted, more subdued claims. They range from fear-mongering about a potential cross-strait conflict to narratives portraying the Republic of China as grappling with <a href=\"https://english.cw.com.tw/article/article.action?id=3580\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">racism</a> and <a href=\"https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/articles/9972\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">food safety</a> issues, to casting doubt on its relationship with Washington.</p><p>In 2023, Taiwan\u2019s National Security Bureau reported a 60 percent increase in Chinese-origin disinformation over the previous year, with a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-disinformation-3f05dac36399bf672a702100147bf8fa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">documented</a> 2.16 million cases on record. Now, as tensions between Beijing and Taipei continue, so too does the sophistication\u2014and volume\u2014of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s disinformation campaign.</p><p>\u201cChina conducts overwhelming political warfare against Taiwan\u2014disinformation, cognitive warfare, fake news,\u201d Liang-Chih Evans Chen, Associate Research Fellow, Institute for National Defense and Security Research, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant battle for public perception and morale. And it\u2019s getting worse.\u201d</p><p>According to Taiwan\u2019s National Security Bureau, China is increasingly leveraging generative artificial intelligence to amplify disinformation efforts aimed at destabilizing Taiwan.</p><p>\u201cThe quality used to be questionable, but that has changed. With AI and deepfake technology, the People\u2019s Liberation Army can manipulate videos and other very convincing media,\u201d one high-ranking Taiwanese military official working in psychological operations, who spoke anonymously because they are not authorized to speak on the record, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cSometimes, they also take raw local footage and re-edit it to appear as if it\u2019s coming from within Taiwan, making it more believable and easier to influence people.\u201d</p><p>So far in 2025, more than 500,000 \u201ccontroversial messages\u201d <a href=\"https://www.arise.tv/china-using-ai-to-fuel-disinformation-campaigns-against-taiwan-says-security-bureau/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">linked</a> back to China have circulated on platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and X, often spiking during politically sensitive moments such as President Lai Ching-te\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/north-east-asia/taiwan-strait-china/president-lais-first-year-sees-increased-tensions-across-taiwan-strait\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">statements</a> on cross-strait relations or major announcements like new U.S. investments by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).</p><p>Disinformation is also <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-disinformation-3f05dac36399bf672a702100147bf8fa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">spread</a> through YouTube, encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, and via fake accounts that used AI-generated profile photos, deepfakes, and phony news articles to make propaganda appear organic and credible.</p><p>\u201cStarting around 2008, China\u2019s main strategy was to purchase media companies in Taiwan to spread their narratives easily. This was somewhat successful. But in 2014, after the Sunflower Movement, a large student-led social movement, China realized young people weren\u2019t watching traditional TV; they got news online,\u201d DPP Legislator and Associate Professor at National Taipei University Graduate School of Criminology, Puma Shen, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThey created many websites that acted like news outlets but were actually filled with disinformation and fake news. Some were based in Singapore or Malaysia but operated by Chinese actors.\u201d</p><p>Shen explained that Facebook was long the \u201cmain channel for distribution.\u201d His team reported suspicious sites to the tech giant, which subsequently blocked them, but \u201cthis method only worked until around 2019-2020,\u201d according to Shen.</p><p>\u201cAfter that, they shifted focus to YouTube. They used AI voices to convert articles into videos with images and then shared those videos on Facebook. Facebook couldn\u2019t block YouTube URLs, so this became a new battlefield,\u201d Shen told us. \u201cCurrently, 70 to 80 percent of political news in Chinese on YouTube is influenced by China\u2019s disinformation campaigns. Google tries to act but struggles. Before Taiwan\u2019s 2024 presidential election, Google removed about 200 Chinese government-related channels per day, but it\u2019s hard to keep up.\u201d</p><p>The biggest struggle now is TikTok, as Taipei has \u201cno cooperation there,\u201d according to Shen.</p><p>\u201cThe algorithm controls what information people see. It\u2019s designed for quick, passive consumption, making it a great tool for brainwashing. Even if only one video out of fifty contains a political message, that message gets embedded in your mind,\u201d Shen said. \u201cThe algorithm isn\u2019t transparent, so they can decide what to show and influence people\u2019s thoughts. This is dangerous, especially when people spend hours swiping through videos daily.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>From disinformation to deepfakes, Cipher Brief experts are tackling today\u2019s most-pressing national security issues at The Cipher Brief Threat Conference October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. If your business is national security, </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><p>Observers also point out that Beijing has shifted its tactics in recent years, moving away from overt messaging on cross-strait relations to more passively stoking internal divisions within Taiwan. This includes smear campaigns and false claims about local services. Often, the disinformation is masked as clickbait\u2014celebrity gossip or wellness content\u2014that subtly steers readers toward politically motivated conspiracy theories.</p><p>The mainland\u2019s disinformation efforts <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-dossiers/asia-pacific-regional-security-assessment-2024/chapter-5/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">involve</a> a broad network of state actors, including its military\u2019s Strategic Support Force, the Ministry of State Security, the Central Propaganda Department, and the Ministry of Public Security\u2014all playing distinct roles in cyber operations, propaganda, and information control. These agencies push overt messaging through state media and diplomatic channels and run covert campaigns, often in partnership with private companies or loosely affiliated groups like hacktivists.</p><p>Outsourcing these operations to commercial entities is a growing trend, making attribution more difficult. This includes paid propagandists, troll farms, clickbait content creators, and data firms selling disinformation tools. By hiring third parties to execute these campaigns, the Chinese government obscures its involvement, complicating accountability and amplifying the reach and sophistication of its influence operations.</p><p>Tactics also include collaborating with sympathetic Taiwanese media, amplifying critical voices from within Taiwan\u2014such as retired military officials and political influencers\u2014and targeting younger audiences through popular platforms.</p><p>Experts underscore that disinformation is becoming more subtle, often disguised as health advice or entertainment before veering into political messaging. While Beijing denies interfering in Taiwan\u2019s affairs, the growing sophistication of these campaigns, bolstered by evolving AI tools, poses an increasingly complex threat to Taiwan\u2019s information integrity and security.</p><p>China\u2019s disinformation campaign aims, analysts say, to erode public trust in Taiwan\u2019s government, particularly the ruling DPP while deterring support for Taiwanese independence.</p><p>Ching Yang, one of the leading investigators at the Taipei-based disinformation monitoring organization Doublethink Lab, highlighted that newspapers in Hong Kong \u201chave recently accused certain politicians or their families of accepting U.S. money to create divisions between Taiwan and Mainland China.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey use allegations about projects and funding to drive disinformation aimed at weakening Taiwan\u2019s unity,\u201d he tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. The DPP, however, may not be the CCP\u2019s primary target.</p><p>\u201cThe real enemy for China is not Taiwan,\u201d Shen stressed. \u201cIt is the U.S.\u201d He points out that there are around 13 \u201cmain narratives\u201d the CCP uses in its disinformation push.</p><p>\u201cWe tested which resonated most with Taiwanese teenagers \u2014 anti-U.S. messages ranked highest,\u201d Shen explained. \u201cThey push anti-U.S. messages both inside Taiwan and in the U.S. They (CCP) try to undermine trust in the U.S. and the West generally. Also, they discourage cooperation with Japan and India. For Taiwanese who are anti-China but consume enough anti-U.S. messaging, the strategy is to make them see China as not so bad.\u201d</p><p>In Taiwan, the disinformation approach is mainly to suggest that Washington is unreliable, would abandon Taiwan in a conflict, or is exploiting the island\u2014such as claims that U.S. arms sales are a scam or that U.S. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67891869\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pork</a> is not safe to consume, claims that have triggered large protests in the past.</p><p>These messages, often amplified by Beijing-linked actors or Taiwanese figures sympathetic to China, don\u2019t always rely on conspiracy theories; instead, they illuminate real news in ways that cast the U.S. in a negative light, fueling skepticism and weakening trust in the U.S.-Taiwan alliance. From Shen\u2019s purview, the objective is to \u201csow distrust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trust the government, don\u2019t trust the ruling party, don\u2019t trust democracy or the U.S,\u201d Shen noted. \u201cThey (CCP) want to persuade maybe 40-50 percent of Taiwanese that China isn\u2019t so bad, and that if China invades, it could take over quickly \u2014 so better to sign a peace agreement. The CCP wants to persuade its citizens that it\u2019s the best party because it brings stability and prosperity.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

Inside the mainland, disinformation helps legitimize potential military action by manufacturing public support and framing aggression as a justified response to Taiwanese provocation, reinforcing nationalist sentiment. Internationally, these campaigns offer China a legal and moral veneer, particularly for non-Western audiences, while casting Taiwan and its allies\u2014especially the U.S.\u2014as aggressors.</p><p>Taipei faces significant challenges in addressing threats posed by disinformation. The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau <a href=\"https://english.ftvnews.com.tw/news/2024119W09EA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">established</a> the Cognitive Warfare Research Center last year, to counter disinformation campaigns targeting Taiwan\u2019s democracy and security. In January, the government <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-disinformation-3f05dac36399bf672a702100147bf8fa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pledged</a> to double down on its efforts to counter burgeoning disinformation campaigns. In late 2022, the government <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202403220009\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">designated</a> Chinese media platforms\u2014including TikTok\u2014 a \u201cnational security threat\u201d and banned their use on government-issued devices. </p><p>While Beijing\u2019s efforts to influence public opinion have largely fallen flat, fatigue is setting in among Taiwanese citizens who are exposed to constant warnings and pressure. Experts warn that as Taiwan sharpens its defenses, China will only evolve its tactics, making future disinformation campaigns harder to detect and resist.</p><p>\u201cTaiwanese people generally recognize the danger from China. But politicians here, like in many countries, sometimes try to downplay it or persuade citizens otherwise,\u201d Shen said. \u201cSince we speak Chinese, we\u2019re vulnerable to Chinese disinformation and \u201clawfare,\u201d China\u2019s legal and political warfare to keep Taiwan isolated internationally.\u201d</p><p>Yang is concerned that Beijing\u2019s growing use of disinformation as a soft power tool could signal a prelude to more aggressive, hard-power or kinetic action.</p><p>\u201cCompared to Russia\u2019s tactics before invading Ukraine, China uses disinformation to frame their opponents negatively. For example, Russian propaganda accused Ukraine of being run by Nazis,\u201d he added. \u201cSimilarly, in Taiwan, Chinese media accuse the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and President Tsai Ing-wen of being \u2018Nazis\u2019 or extremists. This disinformation aims to justify aggression and create division internally.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.

    "description": "<p>Jon Stewart, who hosted<em> The Daily Show</em> on Comedy Central from 1999 to 2015 and has returned for once-a-week hosting stints since 2024, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOLo_U6bTw\">lashed out</a> at his show&#8217;s parent company for choosing to <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91370686/stephen-colberts-late-show-canceled-cbs\">\u201cunceremoniously\u201d end</a> <em>The Late Show</em> <em>with Stephen Colbert</em> and discontinue the franchise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a segment on Monday, Stewart noted his well-documented allegiance to Colbert, even showing a photo of the duo when they were both on <em>The Daily Show</em> from 1999 to 2005.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While statements about the events surrounding the cancellation of <em>The Late Show</em> have been made by many celebrities on social media\u2014and even by hosts of other late-night programs\u2014Stewart added to the conversation by boldly calling out CBS for appearing to overlook the value that compelling late-night programs bring to the media giants that own them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI understand the fear that you and your advertisers have with $8 billion at stake, but understand this: Truly, the shows that you now seek to cancel, censor, and control\u2014a not insignificant portion of that $8 billion value came from those fucking shows\u2014that\u2019s what made you that money,\u201d Stewart said directly into the camera.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The $8 billion that Stewart is referring to is the proposed merger between Paramount Global, which owns CBS, and Skydance, a production company founded and helmed by David Ellison, son of tech billionaire and Trump supporter Larry Ellison. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deal has faced regulatory hurdles, first under the Biden administration and then under the Trump administration. All of this also comes as CBS News <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91362005/paramount-will-settle-with-trump-for-16-million-over-60-minutes-kamala-harris-interview\">announced in July</a> that it will settle a lawsuit filed against <em>60 Minutes</em> by Trump, who claims that the show unfairly edited an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris to make her look more favorable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe fact that CBS didn\u2019t try to save their No. 1-rated network late-night franchise that\u2019s been on the air for over three decades is part of what\u2019s making everyone wonder, was this purely financial or maybe the path of least-resistance for your $8 billion merger?\u201d Stewart asked on his show.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fast Company</em> reached out to CBS, Paramount Global, and Skydance Media. None immediately responded to a request for comment. CBS has referred to the decision to cancel <em>The Late Show</em> as a financial one and unrelated to the show&#8217;s content, citing a &#8220;challenging backdrop&#8221; for late-night television.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although <em>The Late Show</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/stephen-colbert-late-show-canceled-profit-3dcc48a2?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjGeHddOqaBZwLzMb2OOffTbTmPTHdxyQjTO08nkHDGvo8cT0bRn6vDRE_6BRc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=687fee2a&amp;gaa_sig=-YaimGHbTja10E_mqkg5Y067Rh6v4eOiGUdjIIIsrMXDdoyQYNxPTDdKgjVrQIw_fi_CEAJARj-V8Xadu3QaRQ%3D%3D\">has reportedly been losing</a> roughly $40 million a year, according to a source cited by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, Stewart\u2019s larger point is buoyed by the fact that Paramount <a href=\"https://ir.paramount.com/static-files/b7ec193e-39b1-4871-9150-50df2eeb85fd\">earns more than half of its revenue</a> from its television businesses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Paramount has played up its TV assets, including<em> The Late Show</em> and much of its news content, in its pitch to investors about the proposed merger. Colbert&#8217;s image appears multiple times on the New Paramount <a href=\"https://ir.paramount.com/static-files/f06c4f08-0198-4c25-ad50-15f4071b6ef8\">PowerPoint presentation</a>, with the company touting CBS as a leader in late-night TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ratings from Nielsen likewise show <em>The Late Show</em> as the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91370686/stephen-colberts-late-show-canceled-cbs\">top-rated show</a> in its block, with about 2.417 million viewers across 41 new episodes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf you believe, as corporations or as networks, you can make yourself so innocuous, that you can serve a gruel so flavorless that you will never again be on the boy king\u2019s radar? A) why would anyone watch you? And B) you are fucking wrong,\u201d Stewart said.\u00a0</p>",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91358250/ais-unfulfilled-promise-to-small-businesses-ai-small-business",
    "description": "<p>Over the past few years, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">artificial intelligence</a> has dominated business conversations. What once felt like a futuristic concept is now a tangible, widely accessible tool, one that is now seen as table stakes for businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI\u2019s greatest promise is efficiency. For small-business owners who wear multiple hats, this promise sounds like a dream, and for some larger companies, that dream has become reality. Yet for many small and midsize businesses (SMBs) that have invested precious time and money into AI-enabled solutions, that promise remains unfulfilled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a CEO of a company that provides fintech solutions for SMBs, and as a small-business owner myself, I understand the desire to do more with less. I understand how AI can seem like a magical solution. But the reality is, AI tools are not currently made with small businesses in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you have already invested in AI tools, are in the consideration phase, or still testing tools, I urge you to pause everything, take a step back, and reevaluate AI\u2019s role in your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-s-promise-is-not-for-the-masses\">AI\u2019s Promise Is Not for the Masses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is pitched as a game changer for businesses, promising improved <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/productivity\" title=\"Productivity\">productivity</a>, faster workflows, cost savings, and business growth. Major companies like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-hiring-white-collar-recession-jobs-tech-new-data-2025-6\">Duolingo and Shopify</a> have even suggested AI can replace human-led roles. And this may be true, for enterprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This level of efficiency is possible only through custom, complex, and expensive AI models that are programed by dedicated AI teams and trained on an immense amount of data\u2014resources, and results, that are unattainable by SMBs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality is, many SMBs are still digitizing their practices, their data sets are small, budgets are tight, and IT resources are minimal. This is why, instead of trying to mirror the AI adoption strategies of large enterprises, SMBs should take a different approach, one that is slow, simple, and focused on business fundamentals. By focusing on core operations like admin, customer service, and reporting, small businesses can lay the groundwork to ensure AI enhances, rather an complicates, their workflows.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-false-start-smbs-and-ai-adoption\">A False Start: SMBs and AI Adoption</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise that SMB adoption of AI dropped to <a href=\"https://www.nextinsurance.com/blog/ai-for-small-business/\">28% this year</a>, a 33% year-over-year decline. Some have learned from experience that trying to mimic enterprise adoption of AI has had the opposite effect: draining time, money, and productivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many SMBs still have a poor understanding of AI and its learning curves. Without proper in-house resources to implement and train on the technology, SMBs are paying for expensive tools that are not optimized to their business needs. For SMB owners who feel they\u2019ve overcommitted, I encourage you to pause and reassess. Ask yourself: Is this tool achieving what I need it to?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-back-to-basics\">Back to Basics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Broad adoption of AI is a costly mistake for SMBs. Business leaders must slow down and thoughtfully assess where AI can truly make an impact. Start small: Choose one area, such as <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketing</a> or administrative tasks, and measure results before expanding further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than investing in new tools, explore the AI features already built into your existing tech stack. Tools like Microsoft Office, Google Workspace, and Box now offer AI integrations allowing small businesses to easily explore AI applications without significant investment or complexity. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By starting with the tools you already use, you not only lower the barrier to entry, you also concentrate your learning and adoption in a familiar environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-applications-that-work\">AI Applications That Work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI can be highly effective with repetitive tasks such as answering common customer questions and managing inventory. One small business, <a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/enhancing-entrepreneurship-ais-big-impact-on-small-business\">Something Sweet Cookie Dough</a>, used AI to scale recipes and reduce ingredient waste, while also automating responses to frequently asked customer questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI can be a great resource for creative ideation and research as well. However, it\u2019s important for a human to review all materials produced by AI as the technology is prone to misinformation and to misinterpretation of the task at hand. I suggest treating AI like a new employee: regularly checking its work, conducting performance reviews, and slowly introducing new tasks. Do not overrely on AI or assume it can operate unsupervised.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-is-not-automatically-secure\">AI Is Not Automatically Secure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another major oversight is the assumption that AI is inherently secure. Most AI tools\u2014including popular free versions like ChatGPT\u2014learn from the data you share with them. That means sensitive business information could become part of a model\u2019s training data. If you\u2019re in a regulated industry or working with proprietary or confidential information, this is a major risk to your business and customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you input sensitive data into any AI tool, understand how that data will be stored and used. Once you\u2019ve done some trial and error with free versions, consider upgrading to enterprise-grade AI tools that offer security, data privacy, and compliance features tailored to you industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-will-have-a-place-in-smbs\">AI Will Have a Place in SMBs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI can support small businesses, but only if the tools are chosen, applied, and monitored with care. Until AI companies build solutions tailored to the unique needs of SMBs, emphasizing simplicity, affordability, and support, it\u2019s up to business owners to be diligent in the tool\u2019s evaluation. With a measured approach, SMBs can capture the benefits of AI without overinvestment, complicating workflows, or overwhelming you and your team.</p>\n\n\n<hr />",

    "description": "<p>America\u2019s demand for new infrastructure is surging, driven by the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> data center boom, clean energy projects, and a growing national housing crunch. Yet just as the country needs to build faster than ever, it\u2019s facing a mounting challenge: a severe construction labor shortage. The U.S. construction industry is already <a href=\"https://www.abc.org/News-Media/News-Releases/abc-construction-industry-must-attract-439000-workers-in-2025\">short more than half a million workers</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nccer.org/newsroom/how-apprenticeships-empower-adult-learners-and-bridge-the-construction-workforce-gap/\">nearly 41% of its workforce</a> is expected to retire by 2031. For a sector still heavily dependent on manual labor and analog tools, there soon may not be enough people left to do the building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To confront this growing labor crisis, Boris Sofman\u2014a Carnegie Mellon robotics Ph.D. and early Waymo executive\u2014cofounded <a href=\"https://bedrockrobotics.com/\">Bedrock Robotics</a> in 2024. Instead of building autonomous machines from scratch, Bedrock retrofits existing construction equipment like excavators, bulldozers, and loaders with AI-powered operating systems, sensors, and lidar to make them <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj2g9tuJN8A\">fully autonomous</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sofman has brought together fellow engineers from Waymo, Google, and Caterpillar (CAT), many of whom were instrumental in scaling autonomous technologies in some of the world\u2019s most complex machines. The team shares a fundamental belief: the future of construction lies in autonomy, not more manpower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI saw the powerful potential of applying modern ML approaches we developed at Waymo to construction. This is a problem you could not solve without the modern approaches we saw to be so effective, and helped deploy, in transportation, so it felt like a huge opportunity to address this critical need,\u201d Sofman tells <em>Fast Company</em>. \u201cWe can get to a deployed product for a fraction of the cost it took Waymo, and continue to build toward the full potential while growing revenues and serving real customers.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Based in San Francisco, the startup recently emerged from stealth mode with $80 million in seed and Series A funding from top-tier investors including Eclipse, 8VC, NVIDIA\u2019s NVentures, Valor Equity Partners, Two Sigma Ventures, and Samsara. John Krafcik, former CEO of Waymo, also joined as an early investor and adviser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cConstruction is a sector that represents over 10% of global GDP, and it&#8217;s under extraordinary pressure. We\u2019re entering a new phase where industrial AI becomes the most important, and perhaps most underestimated frontier,\u201d Krafcik says. \u201cWith Bedrock, I saw a chance to take the best of what we built at Waymo and apply it to one of the most vital yet overstressed sectors in the global economy.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of Bedrock\u2019s approach is the Bedrock Operator\u2014an AI-powered software and hardware platform that installs in under four hours and can run 24/7, even in remote or high-heat environments where human crews are difficult to retain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bedrock uses large-scale machine learning to translate real-world inputs into precise actions for construction equipment, starting with excavators focused on heavy earthwork. \u201cThis is designed to start with an excavator . . . but be efficiently scalable to new capabilities and new machines,\u201d says Sofman.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-robo-taxis-to-job-sites\">From Robo-Taxis to Job Sites</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bedrock\u2019s founding team includes Kevin Peterson (CTO), former head of perception for Waymo\u2019s commercial trucking division; Tom Eliaz (VP of engineering), who built Segment\u2019s New York engineering office and worked on IBM\u2019s DB2 query optimizer; and Ajay Gummalla (also a VP of engineering), a former director of engineering at Waymo who also helped launch Google Wifi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The broader team includes engineers from Uber Freight, Google, and Adept (now OMRON), <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketers</a> from Deloitte Consulting, and operators from companies like Sonos. While many startups chase the dream of artificial general intelligence (AGI), Bedrock is laser-focused on industrial autonomy\u2014turning legacy machines into intelligent systems without upending workflows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCoupling AI with a modern safety framework based on data analysis and statistics unlocks true autonomy and collaborative machine capabilities in a sector that desperately needs it and is interconnected with our entire economy,\u201d says Matthieu Guilbert, Bedrock&#8217;s robotics lead. \u201cThis allows robots to work safely and effectively in human-centric environments.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91372644\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-Boris-Sofman-Cofounder-and-CEO.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong>Boris Sofman</strong> [Photo: Bedrock Robotics]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The upgraded machines feature 360-degree cameras with LiDAR for full-field visibility and detailed work area understanding. \u201cSurvey-grade inertial measurement units (IMUs) and GPS provide centimeter-precision localization, while LTE antennas keep worksites connected for real-time monitoring,\u201d explained Sofman. Rugged casings protect components from harsh conditions, while the computing system sits inside the cab, integrating sensor data and executing decisions from a large-scale machine learning model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https://kpmg.com/us/en/articles/2025/april-2025-construction-deep-dive.html\">restrictions on foreign labor</a> tightening and infrastructure investment rising\u2014fueled by federal stimulus and AI-driven demand\u2014autonomous construction is becoming not just feasible but necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With rising costs and economic uncertainty, contractors are seeking more predictability on job sites. Bedrock\u2019s autonomous machines offer consistent performance and accurate forecasting. As Sofman puts it, \u201cThese machines deliver consistent, predictable output . . . helping accurately forecast project timelines.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bedrock\u2019s machines are already running at test sites in California, Texas, Arizona, and Arkansas, in collaboration with firms like Sundt Construction and Zachry Construction. Initial customer deployments are planned for August 2025, with full commercial rollout expected in early 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-industrial-autonomy-the-real-ai-gold-rush\">Is Industrial Autonomy the Real AI Gold Rush?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bedrock isn\u2019t aiming to eliminate human workers\u2014it\u2019s aiming to ensure they\u2019re no longer the bottleneck. Skilled crews can focus on complex tasks like pipe-laying, while autonomous systems handle repetitive work such as digging, loading, and overnight shifts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAutomation and robotics are often misunderstood as a zero-sum game. The Bedrock Operator will enhance safety and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/productivity\" title=\"Productivity\">productivity</a>, fostering growth for team members rather than replacing them, due to its ability to integrate into existing workflows,\u201d says Guilbert. \u201cIncreased productivity is expected to encourage general contractors to undertake more projects, resulting in a net increase in labor.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given construction\u2019s high accident rates, Sofman believes Bedrock\u2019s Operator can deliver \u201csuperhuman safety.\u201d On high-risk or remote job sites, that capability could be transformative. Additionally, the AI provides real-time insights such as project progress, earth volume metrics, and billing data\u2014boosting transparency and speeding up payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91372649\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-1-91372492-bedrock-robotics-ai-construction-bots.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Bedrock Robotics]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That pragmatism appeals to investors like John Krafcik.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While AI headlines often focus on AGI, Bedrock\u2019s investors are betting on near-term impact through industrial autonomy. \u201cWhere can AI deliver real impact today? Industrial autonomy, especially in construction, is one of those places,\u201d says Krafcik, who praises Bedrock\u2019s unusually deep talent pool from <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91270760/waymo-most-innovative-companies-2025\">Waymo</a> as \u201ca significant advantage.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the pace of digital innovation, much of the world still runs on physical industries like construction, agriculture, and logistics. Bedrock is one of the few companies applying autonomy to this economically essential layer. As it approaches commercial launch, it\u2019s positioning autonomy as a pragmatic solution to the modern infrastructure crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sofman envisions a future where construction is fully digitized and managed by intelligent systems. \u201cUltimately, this is about digitizing the entire construction process,\u201d he says. The goal? \u201cA general contractor can just define the goal and let the system run.\u201d</p>",

    "title": "Why Colbert\u2019s cancellation is lighting a fire under every late-night host",
    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91372894/colbert-late-night-host-support-cbs-trump",
    "description": "<p>By axing <em>The Late Show With Stephen Colbert</em> last week, CBS not only put an expiration date on <a href=\"https://latenighter.com/news/ratings/late-night-tv-ratings-q2-2025\">TV\u2019s No. 1 late-night talk show</a>\u2014the network also put an enormous target on its own back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the days since CBS made the announcement that the show would be ending in May 2026, all current late-night talk show hosts have bound together in a show of support for Colbert. That support has taken the form of savage jokes about CBS, which canceled Colbert\u2019s show just days after he called <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91362005/paramount-will-settle-with-trump-for-16-million-over-60-minutes-kamala-harris-interview\">the $16 million settlement between CBS parent company Paramount</a> and President Donald Trump \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzvx3L3DQb8\">a big fat bribe</a>.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Paramount stressed that the cancellation was ultimately a financial decision, the company&#8217;s leadership is clearly unconcerned about how it looks to cancel a show led by one of the president\u2019s critics while its <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91152191/what-to-know-about-paramount-skydance-merger-explained\">$8 billion merger</a> with Skydance is pending before that same president\u2019s Federal Communications Commission chair. But Colbert and his fellow late-night hosts aren\u2019t afraid to say exactly what the show\u2019s pending cancellation looks like\u2014punishment from a corporate parent for putting its business at risk.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the first show of his precancellation run is any indicator, Colbert is ready to go out the same way he rose to No. 1, by lobbing scathing jokes at Trump and those who help prop him up. And as his show\u2019s demise lays bare the precarious situation late night is in, Colbert\u2019s peers seem ready to enter their DGAF eras as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-colbert-s-anti-trump-jokes-made-his-show-more-political\">Colbert\u2019s anti-Trump jokes made his show more political</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump\u2019s election in 2016, just one year into Colbert\u2019s tenure, was crucial to helping the host find his footing. He\u2019d had a bit of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/9/9/9287915/stephen-colbert-late-show-debut-recap\">a rocky transition</a> from his satirical Comedy Central series, <em>The Colbert Report</em>, which he\u2019d hosted in character as a Bill O\u2019Reilly-like blowhard. It took him some time\u2014and some unprecedented times\u2014to figure out the best way to be himself on TV.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to Trump\u2019s election, the top late-night talk show was <em>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</em>, mainly known for its host\u2019s affable banter with celebrities and goofy party games. Trump\u2019s election seemed to light a fire under late-night TV, though, offering most of the hosts a sense of purpose and more nightly material than they could possibly handle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Fallon remained largely apolitical, Colbert pounced. By February 2017, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/arts/television/stephen-colbert-trump-late-show.html\">he snatched the top spot of late night for the first time</a>, and then <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/colbert-is-latest-casualty-late-night-tvs-fade-out-2025-07-19\">maintained it throughout the following season</a>. Colbert\u2019s peers <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90346137/most-creative-people-2019-nbc-seth-meyers\">Seth Meyers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90299299/trump-is-a-climate-change-denier-so-jimmy-kimmel-had-kids-explain-why-hes-wrong\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> also grew into their new roles as thorns in the president\u2019s side, while <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/jimmy-fallon-continues-to-lose-ground-in-the-late-night-wars.html\">Fallon floundered</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Late night is floundering\u2014especially at CBS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But amid a downturn in ratings, even Colbert\u2019s viewership has softened as time has gone on. Between the political exhaustion that followed the 2020 election and <a href=\"https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/parks-nearly-half-of-all-u-s-internet-households-are-now-cord-cutters\">a steady increase in cord-cutting </a> in U.S. households, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/late-night-tv-downsizing-1235997584/\">late-night TV ratings have fallen steadily for five years</a>. Colbert now receives <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/cbs-colbert-late-show-cancel-profit-tv-1236319484/\">an average of 2.47 million viewers per show</a>, down more than a million from <a href=\"https://thecomicscomic.com/2020/05/26/late-night-tv-ratings-for-2019-2020/\">his 2018-2019 peak</a>. Late-night ad revenue fell by half from 2018 to 2024, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/business/media/stephen-colbert-late-show-cbs.html\">from $439 million to just $220 million</a>. Even Trump\u2019s return to the White House, with all its attendant chaos, couldn\u2019t entice viewers back to late night this year, with <a href=\"https://latenighter.com/news/ratings/here-are-final-late-night-ratings-for-q1-2025\">ratings down across the board</a> even from last fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CBS has had an especially tough time programming late night. After host James Corden left <em>The Late Late Show</em> in 2023, CBS opted to end the series rather than find a new host, taking a swing by airing the talk show-game show amalgam <em>After Midnight </em>in its time slot. That show ended in June after two seasons, when host Taylor Tomlinson bowed out to focus on stand-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid the tumult, Colbert and his show\u2019s pole position among his peers seemed like an asset for the network. But given his critique of Paramount\u2019s Trump settlement\u2014which heads off a legal battle over the president\u2019s appearance on <em>60 Minutes </em>last fall, which he alleged was edited unfairly\u2014Colbert\u2019s cancellation can easily be perceived as a potential additional condition for the merger. Trump has certainly not done anything to assuage that notion, <a href=\"https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/07/trump-gloats-amid-colbert-firing-predicts-more-to-come-i-hope-i-played-a-major-part-in-it.html\">gloating about it</a> on Truth Social over the weekend.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Colbert and his late-night compatriots are signaling that they\u2019re ready to call it as they see it now that Colbert\u2019s days at CBS are numbered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How late-night hosts responded</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kimmel was the first of the hosts to respond. In a since-lapsed Instagram story on Saturday, July 19, the host wrote: \u201cLove you, Stephen. Fu*k you and all your Sheldons, CBS\u201d (a nod to the main character from the network\u2019s 12-season hit <em>The Big Bang Theory </em>and its 7-season spin-off <em>Young Sheldon</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next came Jon Stewart\u2019s righteously irate, f-bomb-heavy monologue on Monday night\u2019s episode of <em>The Daily Show</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Jon Stewart reacts to CBS cancelling &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; and tells corporations and advertisers to &quot;sack up&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/v8MrNpg28w\">pic.twitter.com/v8MrNpg28w</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1947496128477335911?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the host admitted the fiscal realities of late-night TV in 2025, comparing it to &#8220;operating a Blockbuster kiosk inside of a Tower Records,\u201d he blasted the network for not doing more to save the top show in the format. Stewart concluded that despite those financial challenges, the cancellation was ultimately due to the &#8220;fear and pre-compliance that is gripping all of America&#8217;s institutions.&#8221; He then led a choir and the audience in a chant of \u201cGo fuck yourselves,\u201d aimed at corporations, including Paramount, who have demonstrated fealty to Trump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, just after <em>The Daily Show</em> came the first episode of <em>The Late Show</em> in what may come to be known as its DGAF era. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIZegLAvK8o\">The gloves are off</a>,\u201d the host said early on in the episode, and then spent the rest of the runtime giving a preview of what that will look like. Perhaps taking a cue from Stewart, Colbert responded to Trump\u2019s gloating over his cancellation by telling the president, \u201cGo fuck yourself.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One particular moment from the episode, though, was notable both for its humor and its sprawling show of solidarity. A parade of famous friends including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Weird Al Yankovic, and Adam Sandler showed up for an elaborate bit based on last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91370971/astronomer-ceos-viral-coldplay-moment-reminds-us-were-all-being-watched-all-the-time\">Coldplay kiss-cam fiasco</a>\u2014and they were joined by Colbert\u2019s peers: Meyers, Stewart, and <em>Last Week Tonight</em> host John Oliver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these hosts standing united in purpose (Jimmy Fallon separately <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jimmy-fallon-colbert-late-show-cancellation-reaction-1236325267/\">cracked jokes in support of Colbert on <em>The Tonight Show</em></a>) is a signal that late night is poised to get its biggest jolt since the early days of Trump\u2019s first term. These hosts may be about to crack jokes like there\u2019s no tomorrow, because for the first time in late night\u2019s storied history, there might not be.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91372732/ikea-ai-generated-concept-ads",
    "description": "<p>A new concept ad format for Ikea is going viral, and it shows that <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> ads can actually be good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept, which appears to have <a href=\"https://x.com/Salmaaboukarr/status/1946530149299634618\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first been created by X user @Salmaaboukarr</a>, starts with a wide shot of a drab, dorm-esque room with a simple Ikea-branded cardboard box in the center. In a matter of seconds, the box explodes open, spewing a full room&#8217;s worth of Ikea furniture throughout the space and immediately transforming it into a cozy haven.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This clever play on Ikea\u2019s iconic build-it-yourself model is a glimpse into how far AI models have come in the past several months, and how much of a role they\u2019re poised to play in the future advertising landscape. While it\u2019s not actually a real ad for the brand, it looks convincing enough to be one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Finally got round to testing Veo 3 for ads- IKEA (inspo ad)<br /><br />Prompt below\ud83d\udc47 <a href=\"https://t.co/fSKhIUXf72\">pic.twitter.com/fSKhIUXf72</a></p>&mdash; Salma (@Salmaaboukarr) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Salmaaboukarr/status/1946530149299634618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 19, 2025</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-the-exploding-box-ad-exploded-online\">How the &#8216;exploding box&#8217; ad exploded online</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The creator listed full instructions on how to achieve a similar result using step-by-step prompts on Google\u2019s Veo 3 model, and dozens of creators have since made their own. The original video has over 1 million views and 11,000 likes on X at the time of writing, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMaD8FltaKq/\">another iteration of the Ikea concept</a> has raked in 99,000 likes on Instagram. One creator designed <a href=\"https://x.com/techhalla/status/1947265082653614244\">a spot for Amazon</a>, and another made a video concept for <a href=\"https://x.com/John_Bailey/status/1947017055984595379\">a fake pet care company</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ikea box ad visuals come with a satisfying mix of cardboard sounds and solid thunks as the digital furniture settles into place. This seems to be a result of using <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/google-veo-3-ai-video\">Veo 3</a> itself, which debuted this March and stands out from AI video generator competitors like OpenAI\u2019s Sora for its ability to generate dialogue and audio alongside near-photorealistic video. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, netizens have used Veo 3\u2019s advanced capabilities for a range of content, from <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91353440/ai-generated-asmr-is-taking-over-tiktok\">benign ASMR clips</a> to <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91346487/enjoy-ai-slop-summer-whats-coming-next-is-worse\">alarmingly realistic</a> <a href=\"https://time.com/7290050/veo-3-google-misinformation-deepfake/\">deepfakes of riots and election fraud</a>\u2014and it\u2019s only going to get more powerful from here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-these-ikea-concepts-show-the-possibility-of-ai-generated-ads\">These Ikea concepts show the possibility of AI-generated ads</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many viewers of the original video are responding positively to the ad, with one calling it \u201cmesmerizing.\u201d Predictably, though, the concept is also receiving its fair share of criticism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the aforementioned Instagram post, which includes the caption, \u201cThis is literally a ~$100,000 VFX ad made with one Veo 3 prompt,\u201d some commenters criticized the video, noting it was likely trained on real (and expensive) projects by creative people.&nbsp;Another, noting the mismatched end tables and armoires, and the placement of the ceiling lamp, felt it pointed to AI&#8217;s shortcomings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethical concerns <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91365992/cloudflare-ai-scraping\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">around AI\u2019s use of copyrighted materials</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91368903/ai-data-centers-require-massive-amounts-of-power-making-electricity-more-expensive-for-everyone-around-them\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">its massive energy consumption</a> are certainly valid. However, critiques of the small flaws in these Ikea concept ads\u2014like the placement of an errant lamp\u2014work to undersell how astronomically AI tools have improved in the past several months, and how useful they will inevitably be for <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketers</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back just a year ago <a href=\"http://fastcompany.com/91146911/you-cant-only-blame-ai-for-that-creepy-toys-r-us-ad\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us\u2019s cursed toy ad</a>, which was billed as the first-ever fully AI-generated commercial, it\u2019s difficult to emphasize just how much worse that actual ad looks compared to today\u2019s fan-made AI content. Not only is the image quality markedly better today, but the prompting savvy of AI creators has also improved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of these Ikea concepts, for example, the focus is on the product itself\u2014an area where AI currently excels. If you observe the Ikea concept ads without a fine-tooth comb, it would be difficult to argue that they\u2019re not effective.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, we&#8217;re likely <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91347017/coign-conservative-credit-card-ai-advertisement\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">still in for a lot of AI slop, and probably more of it</a>. But, as with any other tool, the existence of bad AI-generated ads doesn\u2019t mean it&#8217;s impossible for smart, creative people to make good ones. These Ikea concept ads show that, with the right concept, AI can showcase a product without coming off as cringeworthy.</p>",

    "description": "<p>What happens when you spend decades seeding salacious stories about evil lurking in the halls of power, demanding evidence to prove basic truths, and questioning the veracity of that evidence once it\u2019s presented?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Donald Trump is finding out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last week, the president has been trying to fight his way out of a web of his own creation, as some of his truest followers in MAGA world call for the full release of the government\u2019s investigative files concerning convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The outcry from Trump acolytes comes after the Department of Justice published <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1407001/dl?inline\">a two-page memo</a> earlier this month, stating that Epstein\u2019s supposed \u201cclient list,\u201d which Attorney General Pam Bondi previously said was on her desk, didn\u2019t actually exist.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following a weeklong uproar from both the left and right, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/19/nx-s1-5473430/trump-calls-release-jeffrey-epstein-grand-jury-testimony\">Trump finally called on</a> a federal court judge to unseal the grand jury testimony related to Epstein\u2019s case. The Justice Department has also subpoenaed Epstein\u2019s associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving her own 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. But the moves have done little to quell the outrage from the right, particularly after House Speaker Mike Johnson <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/07/22/us/trump-news#mike-johnson-ends-house-session-epstein-vote\">sent the chamber</a> into summer recess early this week to head off a vote on releasing the files. The move prompted fury from the party\u2019s MAGA wing. \u201cCrimes have been committed,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia told reporters. \u201cIf there\u2019s no justice and no accountability, people are going to get sick of it.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As all this has played out, Trump has cast about for someone to blame, pointing the finger at Democrats and his \u201cPAST supporters\u201d for stoking the scandal. In truth, it\u2019s Trump who is uniquely responsible for cultivating the culture of conspiracy in which he\u2019s now floundering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Credit where it\u2019s due: Trump\u2019s long and well-documented history of conspiracy-mongering has been perhaps one of his greatest skills and has almost always worked out in his favor. His constant questioning of President Obama\u2019s birthplace was so successful that it transformed Trump, then a reality star and real estate mogul, into <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/donald-trump-birther\">a cable news fixture</a>. Later on, his success at convincing <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/03/politics/cnn-poll-republicans-think-2020-election-illegitimate\">nearly three-quarters of Republicans</a> that the 2020 election was stolen played no small role in securing his 2024 election victory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the speculation about which other A-listers were in Epstein\u2019s orbit were often fair game for Trump. In 2019, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-years-including-2024-campaign-trail/story?id=123778541\">Trump fed rumors</a> that the Clintons were somehow involved in Epstein\u2019s death by suicide in prison. \u201cDid Bill Clinton go to the island? That&#8217;s the question,\u201d Trump said at the time. Nevermind that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/19/us/politics/inside-trump-epstein-friendship.html\">Trump and Epstein were close friends</a> or that <a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/\">he once told</a> <em>New York</em> magazine that Epstein \u201clikes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d Trump is a devoted student of the \u201cI\u2019m rubber, you\u2019re glue\u201d school of politics\u2014and for the most part, it\u2019s worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now it\u2019s Trump who\u2019s found himself stuck to Epstein, and he has no one to blame but himself. After all, it was Trump who taught his followers not to trust the abridged version of a story (see: Trump\u2019s campaign to secure Obama\u2019s long-form birth certificate in 2011). Now, it stands to reason those same people want more than a two-page summary of the DOJ\u2019s Epstein investigation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was Trump who convinced a certain subset of the American electorate to scour video evidence for <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=trump+smoking+gun+video+2020&amp;sca_esv=d4acbba8fa1ce30c&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifPk39NhHxJCaUuBKNkLjVsDHjMxTQ%3A1753124211525&amp;ei=c41-aOzmH_2yptQPpa6g-Qc&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis7P_O0M6OAxV9mYkEHSUXKH8Q4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=trump+smoking+gun+video+2020&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiHHRydW1wIHNtb2tpbmcgZ3VuIHZpZGVvIDIwMjBI6AVQwwFYqwRwAXgAkAEAmAFfoAGTA6oBATW4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgCgAgCYAwCIBgGSBwCgB-EBsgcAuAcAwgcAyAcA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp\">alleged election night aberrations</a> in 2020. Is it any wonder they\u2019re now spiraling over the missing minute (or minutes, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-fbis-jeffrey-epstein-prison-video-had-nearly-3-minutes-cut-out/\">according to <em>Wired</em></a>) in the video footage the government released of the night Epstein died?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the stories linking Trump to Epstein just keep growing. On Monday, <em>The New York Times</em> reported that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/20/us/politics/epstein-employee-trump-investigation.html\">one of Epstein\u2019s accusers</a> encouraged the FBI to look into Trump as early as 1996. And<em> The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796?st=sLXzx2\">reported last week</a> that Trump once sent Epstein a lewd birthday card, featuring a hand-drawn outline of a naked woman and allusions to their shared secrets. The <em>Journal</em> reported that the card is among the documents DOJ officials reviewed as part of the Epstein investigation. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-sues-wall-street-journal-over-epstein-report-seeks-10-billion-2025-07-19/\">Trump has denied the story,</a> calling the article \u201cfake news\u201d and has since sued the <em>Journal</em> for defamation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That controversy prompted some conservatives who\u2019d been critical of the Trump administration\u2019s approach to Epstein to leap to the president\u2019s defense. But that reprieve may be short-lived. As one Trump ally, Mike Benz, <a href=\"https://x.com/Bannons_WarRoom/status/1946603260250329116\">said on Steve Bannon\u2019s podcast</a> over the weekend, \u201cYou trained us to go after this issue.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91371531/want-to-adopt-ai-in-your-workplace-start-by-building-a-foundation-first",
    "description": "<p>When Microsoft announced that it would start evaluating employees on their <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> usage, it sent a clear message: AI fluency is now part of the job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-internal-memo-using-ai-no-longer-optional-github-copilot-2025-6\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Business Insider</a>&nbsp;recently reported that Microsoft was asking managers to track employee engagement with internal AI tools like Copilot and consider that usage in performance reviews. This signals that AI skills are becoming as measurable as teamwork or communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is no longer optional in white-collar jobs. It now ranks alongside email, video calls, and spreadsheets as a workplace essential. However, unlike those tools, AI continues to occupy uncharted territory. There\u2019s no standard for how to use it, no shared definition of what \u201cgood\u201d looks like, and no clear line between acceptable and risky behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology is also evolving faster than most companies can keep up with. Many employers are encouraging or requiring the use of AI without offering the training or oversight to match. That mismatch is creating more than confusion. It\u2019s leading to misuse, uneven evaluations, and pressure on employees to guess their way through a system that doesn\u2019t even exist yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft\u2019s decision carries weight. When one of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies sets a precedent, others are likely to follow. But if companies adopt similar policies without fixing the missing guardrails, it can lead to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91316866/this-is-the-hidden-crisis-in-leadership-teams\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">misalignment and dysfunction</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-consequences-of-throwing-employees-into-the-ai-deep-end\"><a></a>The consequences of throwing employees into the AI deep end</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pushing AI adoption is smart, but leaving employees to figure it out alone isn\u2019t. Companies are asking workers to operate fast-changing, complex tools with little support. The results are messy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Gen Z professionals are already improvising in the absence of clear guidance. In a recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://resumegenius.com/blog/career-advice/gen-z-and-ai\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Resume Genius survey</a>, 39% of Gen Z workers said they\u2019ve automated tasks without their manager\u2019s approval. Another 28% admitted to submitting AI-generated work without disclosure. Nearly a third used AI in ways that might violate company policy, and 23% reported that using AI at work negatively affected their mental health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That pattern isn\u2019t just limited to Gen Z. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/ai-and-technology/trust-attitudes-and-use-of-ai.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2025 KPMG study</a>&nbsp;of 48,000 workers across 47 countries found that 57% are hiding their AI use from managers. Most haven\u2019t received formal training. Two-thirds don\u2019t verify AI outputs for accuracy, and more than half have already made AI-related mistakes on the job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, these findings point to workplaces where AI use is rising fast. But employees are making up the rules as they go, often under pressure and without a clear sense of what\u2019s safe, ethical, or expected. This kind of uncertainty isn\u2019t sustainable, especially as job expectations involve the use of AI. Requiring AI without structure is like handing out calculators in math class without ever teaching equations. Sure, the tools are powerful, but if you want good outcomes out of those tools, you need to teach people how to use them properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-productivity-is-improving-but-at-what-cost\"><a></a>Productivity is improving, but at what cost?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI can boost performance. That much is clear. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/05/research-gen-ai-makes-people-more-productive-and-less-motivated\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2025 Harvard Business Review study</a>&nbsp;found that generative AI improves both <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/productivity\" title=\"Productivity\">productivity</a> and creativity. But it also uncovered a troubling side effect: employees felt less motivated and more disengaged when they used AI to complete tasks they once took pride in doing themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91269165/how-to-spot-the-red-flags-for-burnout-in-yourself-and-coworkers\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">burnout is rising</a>. According to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://investors.upwork.com/news-releases/news-release-details/upwork-research-reveals-new-insights-ai-human-work-dynamic\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">July 2025 Upwork survey</a>, employees who report the highest productivity gains from AI are also the most burned out. 88% of top AI users say they\u2019re experiencing burnout, and they\u2019re twice as likely to consider quitting compared to less productive peers. Many also feel disconnected from their company\u2019s AI strategy, with 62% reporting that they don\u2019t understand how their use of AI aligns with broader goals. It seems that the more AI increases productivity, the more it drains the people who use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-happens-when-the-rules-are-missing\"><a></a>What happens when the rules are missing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, AI use at work is both essential and undefined. This creates three major risks for companies:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"1\">\n<li><strong>Compliance breakdowns</strong>:\u00a0Without clear policies, employees may expose sensitive data, rely on flawed outputs, or use AI in ways that open the door to legal risks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Subjective reviews</strong>:\u00a0When \u201cusing AI effectively\u201d becomes part of evaluations, but no standards exist, employees may be graded on personal bias instead of actual performance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Erosion of trust</strong>: Workers are left wondering what\u2019s okay and what isn\u2019t. Managers don\u2019t always know either. This results in second-guessing on all sides, which isn\u2019t ideal for anyone.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-businesses-need-to-do-when-it-comes-to-ai\"><a></a>What businesses need to do when it comes to AI<strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The companies that thrive in this new era won\u2019t be the ones that push AI the fastest. They\u2019ll be the ones that do three things well:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"1\">\n<li><strong>Set clear policies</strong>: Define what\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91069648/ai-ethical-review-should-empower-innovation-not-prevent-it\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">responsible AI</a>\u00a0use looks like in your workplace. Spell out what your companies encourage, what you restrict, and where to ask for help.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Offer practical, task-based training</strong>: Skip the generic webinars. Teach employees how to apply AI to their actual work, whether that\u2019s drafting policy language, summarizing customer feedback, or automating reports.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Build real-time feedback loops</strong>: Hold regular check-ins to ask: What\u2019s working? What\u2019s unclear? What needs to evolve? AI is moving fast. Policies need to move with it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><a></a>If AI is now part of the job, it needs its own set of guidelines. The companies that succeed won\u2019t be the ones who adopt it fastest, but the ones who build the right foundation and teach people how to use it well. Microsoft started the conversation. Now the rest of us need to define what responsible AI adoption looks like and put it into practice.</p>",

The next evolution of work demands a shift from efficiency to emergence, from silos to systems, and from time-tracking to meaning-making.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-machines-to-living-systems\">From Machines to Living Systems</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The metaphors we use drive the systems we design. Treat an organization like a machine and you\u2019ll optimize for speed, control, and predictable outputs. Treat it like a living system\u2014dynamic, interdependent, and regenerative\u2014and a different design logic emerges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what changes when we swap gears for genes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Sense-and-respond edges. </strong>Like cell membranes, customer-facing teams become sensors that provide real-time insights back to the core, allowing the entire organization to adapt quickly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Organizational metabolism.</strong> Energy (attention, data, and trust) is metabolized into creativity, innovation, and renewal, not just raw output.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cultural homeostasis. </strong>Healthy feedback loops foster psychological safety and inclusion, ensuring the system remains vibrant even as external conditions change.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing companies this way frees leaders from predicting the future; instead, they cultivate conditions in which emergent intelligence can thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-measuring-vitality-not-just-time\">Measuring Vitality, Not Just Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The hours worked show little correlation with the value created. What matters is employee vitality, the degree to which people feel rested, connected, and empowered to take risks and experiment. Global four-day-week <a href=\"https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/remote-flexible-companies-with-4-day-workweek\">pilots</a> demonstrate the benefits: burnout dropped by 71%, stress decreased by 39%, carbon emissions are noticeably lower, and retention is markedly higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/04/microsoft-japan-four-day-work-week-productivity\">Microsoft Japan</a>\u2019s Work-Life Choice Challenge, a four-day workweek pilot, proves this point. By closing offices every Friday (while maintaining pay), sales per employee increased by roughly 40%, energy use decreased by 23%, and printing costs dropped by 60%. The gains weren\u2019t the result of heroic hustle; they were the fruit of redesigning the system itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-letting-ai-amplify-humanity\">Letting AI Amplify Humanity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI can be the scaffolding for a more human-centric enterprise. Routine analysis that once devoured strategic attention now finishes in minutes. In my advisory work, I have seen leadership teams channel the freed-up bandwidth into scenario building, story crafting, and high-trust stakeholder dialogues. <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier\">McKinsey</a> estimates that generative AI could lift labor productivity growth by up to 3.4 percentage points per year through 2040. Those gains appear only when roles are deliberately reinvented, not merely automated. This isn\u2019t AI versus humans; it\u2019s AI with humans.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-linear-growth-to-regenerative-growth\">From Linear Growth to Regenerative GROWTH</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the industrial era taught us to measure work in widgets and hours, the new era demands a more integrated lens, one that blends systems thinking, emotional intelligence, and regenerative design. To translate organism thinking into everyday practice, we developed the GROWTH framework\u2014a six-step shift from extractive output to regenerative impact:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>G \u2013 Generate New Metaphors:</strong> Swap \u201cfactory\u201d for \u201cforest,\u201d and \u201cassembly line\u201d for \u201cecosystem.\u201d Fresh language surfaces hidden assumptions and fresh design options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>R \u2013 Reimagine Human Roles:</strong> Let AI handle the rote tasks so people can focus on curiosity, synthesis, and relationship-building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>O \u2013 Optimize for Human Vitality:</strong> Prioritize rest, autonomy, and connection; vital people compound long-term value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>W \u2013 Work in Ecosystems: </strong>Replace silos with cross-functional guilds that share data, talent, and learning loops. Complexity is tamed through connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>T \u2013 Track Whole Metrics:</strong> Pair profit with carbon avoided, bias reduced, and ideas shipped. What gets measured gets improved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>H \u2013 Harvest Regeneration:</strong> Design projects that return energy to the system\u2014employee upskilling, circular supply chains, and community partnerships.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-questions-to-spark-the-shift\">Questions to Spark the Shift</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing how we think about productivity begins with changing our questions. Use the prompts below in leadership sessions, strategy retreats, or team huddles to surface hidden assumptions and align around a more human-centered, system-aware approach to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Which metaphors dominate our language today, and what behaviors do they reinforce?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Where could AI relieve cognitive or emotional load so humans can do higher-order work?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What value are we creating that isn\u2019t yet on a scorecard\u2014culture, climate, social trust?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If we trimmed hours by 10%, where would vitality and innovation likely rise?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What small regenerative habit\u2014repair, reuse, reflective pause\u2014could we start this quarter?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We stand at a crossroads. We can cling to mechanical models that view people as cogs and growth as linear output, or we can adopt a living-systems mindset where vitality, adaptability, and shared purpose define productivity. Redesigned productivity isn\u2019t about working less; it\u2019s about working more wisely. The future won\u2019t be built by those who clock the longest hours. It will be built by those who design the richest conditions for creativity, connection, and contribution. The machine age is ending; the living-system era has begun. Let\u2019s grow accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

Members of the movement, she said, understood that law enforcement agencies were surveilling their activities.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been warned my entire life, \u2018The FBI\u2019s watching us,\u2019\u201d said Farrell-Smith, a member of the Klamath Tribes in Oregon.</p>\n\n<p>Government records later confirmed <a href=\"https://shec.ashp.cuny.edu/exhibits/show/settler-colonialism-and-indige/item/3462\">wide-ranging FBI surveillance of the movement</a> in the 1970s, and now the agency is focused on her and a new generation of Indigenous activists challenging development of a mine in northern Nevada. Farrell-Smith advises the group People of Red Mountain, which opposes a Canadian company\u2019s efforts to tap what it says is one of the world\u2019s largest lithium deposits.</p>\n\n<p>Law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, have for years worked alongside private mine security to surveil the largely peaceful protesters who oppose the mine, called Thacker Pass, according to more than 2,000 pages of internal law enforcement communications reviewed by ProPublica. Officers and agents have tracked protesters\u2019 social media, while the mining company has gathered video from a camera above a campsite protesters set up on public land near the mine. An FBI joint terrorism task force in Reno met in June 2022 \u201cwith a focus on Thacker Pass,\u201d the records also show, and Lithium Americas \u2014 the main company behind the mine \u2014 hired a former FBI agent specializing in counterterrorism to develop its security plan.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re out there doing ceremony and they\u2019re surveilling us,\u201d Farrell-Smith said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey treat us like we\u2019re domestic terrorists,\u201d added Chanda Callao, an organizer with People of Red Mountain.</p>\n\n<p>All told, about 10 agencies have monitored the mine\u2019s opponents. In addition to the FBI, those agencies include the Bureau of Land Management, Humboldt County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Nevada State Police Highway Patrol, Winnemucca Police Department and Nevada Threat Analysis Center, the records show.</p>\n\n<p>Andrew Ferguson, who studies surveillance technology at the American University Washington College of Law, called the scrutiny of Indigenous and environmental protesters as potential terrorists \u201cchilling.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt obviously should be concerning to activists that anything they do in their local area might be seen in this broad-brush way of being a federal issue of terrorism or come under the observation of the FBI and all of the powers that come with it,\u201d Ferguson said.</p>\n\n<p>The FBI did not respond to requests for comment. The Bureau of Land Management, which coordinated much of the interagency response, declined to comment. Most of the law enforcement activity has focused on monitoring, and <a href=\"https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/free-speech-or-interference-in-rare-move-lithium-americas-sues-thacker-pass-protesters\">one person has been arrested to date</a> as a result of the protests.</p>\n\n<p>Mike Allen, who served as Humboldt County\u2019s sheriff until January 2023, said his office\u2019s role was simply to monitor the situation at Thacker Pass. \u201cWe would go up there and make periodic patrol activity,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Allen defended the joint terrorism task force, saying it was \u201cwhere we would just all get together and discuss things.\u201d (The FBI characterizes <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/terrorism/joint-terrorism-task-forces\">such task forces</a>, which include various agencies working in an area, as the front line of defense against terrorism.)</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            In this May 2022 email, an FBI special agent invites Nevada\u2019s Humboldt County Sheriff\u2019s Office to a joint terrorism task force meeting focused on Thacker Pass.\n    \n            (Records obtained by Siskiyou Rising Tide and Information for Public Use.

In all those cases, Lithium Americas avoided engagement with the protestors and coordinated with the local authorities when necessary for the protection of everyone involved.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Crowley noted that Lithium Americas has worked with Indigenous communities near the mine to study cultural artifacts and is offering to build projects worth millions of dollars for the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe, such as a community center and greenhouse.</p>\n\n<p>But individuals and the community groups opposed to the mine don\u2019t want money. They worry mining will pollute local sources of water in the nation\u2019s driest state and harm culturally significant sites, including that of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-lithium-corp-nevada-reno-native-americans-0057adec1750407e862e547a362d3aa8\">an 1865 massacre of Indigenous people.</a></p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe understand how the land is sacred and how much culture and how much history is within the McDermitt Caldera,\u201d Callao said of the basin where Thacker Pass is located. \u201cWe know how much it means to not only the next generation, but the next seven generations.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n\n                            \n                                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n\n            First image: Construction at Lithium Americas\u2019 Thacker Pass mine near Orovada, Nevada.

Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are contributing to increasingly intense hurricanes, heat waves, wildfires and droughts. The solution \u2014 powering the electrical grid, vehicles and factories with cleaner energy sources \u2014 brings tradeoffs.</p>\n\n<p>Massive amounts of metals are required to manufacture solar panels, wind turbines and other renewable energy infrastructure. Demand for lithium will skyrocket 350% by 2040, largely to be used in electric vehicles\u2019 rechargeable batteries, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/lithium-2\">according to the International Energy Agency</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. produces very little lithium \u2014 and China controls a majority of refining capacity worldwide \u2014 so development of Thacker Pass enjoys bipartisan support, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-technology-us-news-nevada-a045e1cb9e5be5d010186720143e4d54\">receiving a key permit</a> in President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-energy-dept-finalizes-226-billion-loan-lithium-americas-nevada-mine-2024-10-28/\">a $2.26 billion loan</a> from President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. (Development ran into issues in June, when a Nevada agency <a href=\"https://gbrw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lithium-Nevada-CD.pdf\">notified the company</a> that it was using groundwater without the proper permit. <a href=\"https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/06/26/state-orders-lithium-mine-to-stop-unauthorized-water-pumping-citing-rancher-dispute/\">Company representatives have said</a> they are confident that they will resolve the matter.)</p>\n\n<p>Many minerals needed to produce cleaner energy are found on Indigenous lands. For example, 85% of known global lithium reserves are on or near Indigenous people\u2019s lands, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-00994-6#Fig1\">according to a 2022 study</a> by researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia, the University of the Free State in South Africa and elsewhere. The situation has put Indigenous communities at odds with mining industries as tribes are asked to sacrifice land and sovereignty to combat climate change.</p>\n\n<p>Luke Danielson is a mining consultant and lawyer who for decades has researched how mining affects Indigenous lands. \u201cWhat I fear would be we set loose a land rush where we\u2019re trampling over all the Indigenous people and we\u2019re taking all the public land and essentially privatizing it to mining companies,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>If companies or governments attempt to force mining on such communities, it can slow development, noted Ciaran O\u2019Faircheallaigh, a professor emeritus of Australia\u2019s Griffith University and author of \u201cIndigenous Peoples and Mining.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf there are bulldozers coming down the road and they are going to destroy an area that is central to people\u2019s identity and their existence, they are going to fight,\u201d he said. \u201cThe solution is you actually put First Peoples in a position of equal power so that they can negotiate outcomes that allow for timely, and indeed speedy, development.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Environmental activists Will Falk, left, and Max Wilbert led early opposition to the mine, after which the Bureau of Land Management fined them tens of thousands of dollars for the cost of monitoring them.\n    \n            (David Calvert/The Nevada Independent)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n\u201cWe\u2019re Not There for an Uprising\u201d\n<p>Most of the documents tracing law enforcement\u2019s involvement at Thacker Pass were obtained via public records requests by two advocacy groups focused on climate change and law enforcement, Siskiyou Rising Tide and Information for Public Use. They shared the records with ProPublica, which obtained additional documents through separate public records requests to law enforcement agencies.</p>\n\n<p>Given the monitoring of mining\u2019s opponents highlighted in the records, experts raised questions about authorities\u2019 role: Is the government there to support industrial development, protect civil liberties or act as an unbiased arbiter? At Thacker Pass, the documents show, law enforcement has helped defend the mine.</p>\n\n<p>Protests have at times escalated.</p>\n\n<p>A small group of <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-an-anti-trans-group-split-the-fight-against-a-lithium-mine/\">more radical environmentalists led by non-Indigenous activists</a> propelled the early movement, setting up a campsite on public land near the proposed mine site in January 2021. In June 2022, a protester from France wrote on social media, \u201cWe\u2019ll need all the AR15s We can get on the frontlines!\u201d Tensions peaked in June 2023, when several protesters entered the worksite and blocked bulldozers, leading to one arrest.</p>\n\n<p>That group \u2014 which calls itself Protect Thacker Pass \u2014 argued that its actions were justified. Will Falk, one of the group\u2019s organizers, said that, in any confrontation, scrutiny unfairly falls on protesters instead of companies or the government. \u201cAs a culture, we\u2019ve become so used to militarized police that we don\u2019t understand that, out of the group of people gathered, the people who are actually violent are the ones with the guns,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Falk and another organizer were, as a result of their participation in protests, barred by court order from returning to Thacker Pass and disrupting construction, and the Bureau of Land Management fined them <a href=\"https://thisisreno.com/2021/09/blm-fines-attorney-involved-in-thacker-pass-lithium-mine-lawsuit/\">for alleged trespass on public lands during the protest</a>. The agency charged them $49,877.71 for officers\u2019 time and mileage to monitor them, according to agency records Falk shared with ProPublica. Falk said his group tried to work with the agency to obtain permits and is disputing the fine to a federal board of appeals.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNone of us are armed. We\u2019re not there for an uprising,\u201d said Gary McKinney, a spokesperson for People of Red Mountain, which parted ways with Falk\u2019s group before the incident that led to an arrest.</p>\n\n<p>McKinney, a member of the Duck Valley Shoshone-Paiute Tribe, leads annual prayer rides, journeying hundreds of miles across northern Nevada on horseback with other Native American activists to Thacker Pass. He described the rides, intended to raise awareness of mining\u2019s impact on tribes and the environment, as a way to exercise rights under the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, which protects tribes\u2019 ability to practice traditional spirituality. Still, the group feels watched. A trail camera once mysteriously appeared near their campsite along the path of the prayer ride. They also crossed paths with security personnel. </p>\n\n<p>Beyond the trail rides, the FBI tracks McKinney\u2019s activity, the records show. The agency informed other law enforcement when he promoted a Fourth of July powwow and rodeo on his reservation, and it flagged a speech he delivered at a conference for mining-affected communities.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re being watched, we\u2019re being followed, we\u2019re under the microscope,\u201d McKinney said.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n\n                            \n                                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n\n            First image: Then-Humboldt County Sheriff Mike Allen questioned whether Raymond Mey, a Lithium Americas security contractor, had a state private investigator\u2019s license in a June 2021 email.

Highlighted, redacted and excerpted by ProPublica.)\n    \n    \n    \n\n            \n                    \n    \n                    \n<p>The records show security personnel hired by Lithium Americas speaking as if an uprising could be imminent. \u201cTo date, there has been no violence or serious property destruction, however, the activities of these protest groups could change to a more aggressive actions and violent demeanor at any time,\u201d Raymond Mey, who joined Lithium Americas\u2019 security team for a time after a career with the FBI, wrote to law enforcement agencies in July 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Mey also researched protesters\u2019 activities, sharing his findings with law enforcement. In an April 2021 update, for example, he provided an aerial photograph of the protesters\u2019 campsite. Law enforcement agencies worked with Mey, and he pushed to make that relationship closer, seeking \u201can integrated and coordinated law enforcement strategy to deal with the protestors at Thacker Pass.\u201d The records indicate that the FBI was open to him attending its joint terrorism task force.</p>\n\n<p>Mey is not licensed with the Nevada Private Investigators Licensing Board, which is required to perform such work in the state, according to agency records.</p>\n\n<p>Mey said that he didn\u2019t believe he needed a license because he wasn\u2019t pursuing investigations. He said that his advice to the company was to avoid direct conflict with protesters and only call the police when necessary.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n\n                            \n                                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n\n            First image: Gary McKinney, spokesperson for People of Red Mountain.

Two recent fights at the heart of this clash have intersected with Thacker Pass \u2014 one concerning an oil pipeline in the Great Plains and the other over a copper mine in the Southwest.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning in 2016 and continuing for nearly a year, <a href=\"https://americanindian.si.edu/nk360/plains-treaties/dapl\">a large protest camp on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation</a> sought to halt construction of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access Pipeline. Members of the Indigenous-led movement contended that it threatened the region\u2019s water. The protest turned violent, leading to hundreds of arrests. Law enforcement eventually cleared the camp and the pipeline was completed.</p>\n\n<p>Law enforcement agencies feared similar opposition at Thacker Pass, the records show.</p>\n\n<p>In April 2021, Allen, then the local sheriff, and his staff met with Mark Pfeifle, president and CEO of the communications firm Off the Record Strategies, to discuss \u201clessons learned\u201d from the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. Pfeifle, who helped the Bush administration build support for the second Gulf War, <a href=\"https://www.desmog.com/2017/07/20/emails-bush-iraq-war-pr-delve-off-the-record-strategies-dakota-access-pipeline/\">had more recently led a public relations blitz</a> to discredit the Standing Rock protesters. This involved <a href=\"https://grist.org/protest/standing-rock-national-sheriffs-association-tigerswan-dakota-access-pipeline/\">suggesting using a fake news crew</a> and mocking up wanted posters for activists, according to emails obtained by news organizations. Pfeifle sent Allen presentations about the law enforcement response at Standing Rock, including one on \u201cExamples of \u2018Fake News\u2019 and disinformation\u201d from the protesters. \u201cAs always, we stand ready to help your office and your citizens,\u201d he wrote to the sheriff.</p>\n\n<p>The department appears not to have hired Pfeifle, although Allen directed his staff to also meet with Pfeifle\u2019s colleague who worked on the Standing Rock response.</p>\n\n<p>Around July 2021, the Humboldt County Sheriff\u2019s Office held a meeting \u201cto plan for the reality of a large-scale incident at Thacker Pass\u201d similar to the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. Police referred to the ongoing protests on public land at Thacker Pass as an \u201coccupation.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Allen said he didn\u2019t remember meeting with Pfeifle but said he wanted to be prepared for anything. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to expect, but from what we understand, there were professional protestors up there and more were coming in,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Pfeifle didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Members of People of Red Mountain have also traveled to Arizona to object to the development of a controversial copper mine that\u2019s planned in a national forest east of Phoenix. There, some members of the San Carlos Apache Tribe oppose the development because it would destroy an area they use for ceremonies. (In May, <a href=\"https://azmirror.com/2025/05/27/supreme-court-refuses-apache-plea-to-save-oak-flat-from-copper-mining-destruction/\">the Supreme Court handed down a decision</a> allowing a land transfer, removing the final key obstacle to the mine.)</p>\n\n<p>On these trips, Callao and others have frequently found a \u201cnotice of baggage inspection\u201d from the Transportation Security Administration in their checked luggage. She provided ProPublica with photos of five such notices.</p>\n\n<p>An agency spokesperson said that screening equipment does not know to whom the bag belongs when it triggers an alarm, and officers must search it.</p>\n\n<p>To Callao, the surveillance, whether by luggage inspection, security camera or counterterrorism task force, adds to the weight placed on Indigenous communities amid the energy transition.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to accept the burden of the climate crisis,\u201d Callao said, \u201cWe should be able to protect our ancestral homelands.\u201d</p>",

Authorities noticed the vehicle was running and unlocked, and the keys were left in the ignition.</p>\n        <p>According to deputies, while they were examining the baby, 28-year-old Clarisse Finnegan exited the bar and told authorities she owned the car. The woman reportedly further said her husband, 60-year-old Norman Finnegan Jr., was inside the bar.</p>\n        <p>A witness allegedly noticed the vehicle at around 10 p.m. when she arrived at the bar, and a man came out approximately 15 minutes later, looked inside, and then went back into the bar.</p>\n        <p>According to the sheriff\u2019s office, Finnegan said she first went to the bar to use the restroom and to get money from her husband to purchase necessities for the baby. She reportedly said she checked on the infant and then went inside the bar to see if her husband was ready to leave. Finnegan Jr. allegedly paid for his tab before his wife went outside and was taken into custody for questioning.</p>\n        <p>The sheriff\u2019s office said the couple provided conflicting statements about Finnegan\u2019s timing in the bar. Witnesses reportedly claimed they saw both Finnegan and her husband drinking inside the establishment.</p>\n        <p>Authorities arrested the couple, and they were charged with felony child neglect without great bodily harm. Finnegan Jr. was released on $2,500 bond, while his wife was released on her own recognizance.</p>\n        <p>Sheriff Rick Staly said, \"These two will never receive parents of the year award with this behavior. It\u2019s never acceptable to leave an infant alone inside a running vehicle \u2014 especially while inside a bar drinking. This kind of recklessness could have ended in tragedy.

Rollins oversees the wildland firefighting workforce at the U.S. Forest Service, a subagency of the Department of Agriculture. Rollins had noted in her remarks that the administration had exempted firefighters from a federal hiring freeze, and she claimed that the administration was outdoing its predecessor: \u201cWe have reached 96% of our hiring goal, far outpacing the rate of hiring and onboarding over the past three years and in the previous administration.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the Forest Service\u2019s assertions have gotten even more optimistic: The agency now claims it has reached <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/fire/workforce\">99% of its firefighting hiring goal</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But according to internal data obtained by ProPublica, Rollins\u2019 characterization is dangerously misleading. She omitted a wave of resignations from the agency this spring and that many senior management positions remain vacant. Layoffs by the Department of Government Efficiency, voluntary deferred resignations and early retirements have severely hampered the wildland firefighting force. According to the internal national data, which has not been previously reported, more than 4,500 Forest Service firefighting jobs \u2014 as many as 27% \u2014 remained vacant as of July 17. A Forest Service employee who is familiar with the data said it comes from administrators who input staffing information into a computer tool used to create organization charts. The employee said that while the data could contain inaccuracies in certain forests, it broadly reflects the agency\u2019s desired staffing levels. The employee said the data showing \u201cactive\u201d unfilled positions was \u201ccurrent and up-to-date for last week.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The Department of Agriculture disputes that assessment, but the figures are supported by anecdotal accounts from wildland firefighters in New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, California and Wyoming. According to a recent survey by Forest Service fire managers in California, 26% of engine captain positions and 42% of engineer positions were vacant. A veteran Forest Service firefighter in California characterized the Trump administration\u2019s current estimate of the size of its firefighting workforce as \u201cgrossly inaccurate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Last week, Tom Schultz, the chief of the Forest Service, circulated a letter to high-ranking officials in the agency that underscored the dire moment. \u201cAs expected, the 2025 Fire Year is proving to be extremely challenging,\u201d wrote Schultz in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by ProPublica. \u201cWe know the demand for resources outpaces their availability.\u201d Schultz at once directed staff to employ full suppression \u2014 stomping out fires as quickly as possible, instead of letting them burn for the sake of landscape management \u2014 and acknowledged that the resources necessary to pursue such an aggressive strategy were lacking. All options were on the table, he wrote, including directing human-resources employees to fight fires and asking recently departed employees with firefighting qualifications to return to work.</p>\n\n<p>When asked about the discrepancy between Schultz\u2019s memo and Rollins\u2019 public statements on firefighting staffing at the Forest Service, an agency spokesperson said that Schultz was referring to employees who can be called on to bolster the agency\u2019s response \u201cas fire activity increases,\u201d while Rollins was pointing only to full-time firefighters. \u201cThe Forest Service remains fully equipped and operationally ready to protect people and communities from wildfire,\u201d the spokesperson said, noting that \u201cmany individuals that have separated from the Agency either through retirements or voluntary resignations still possess active wildland fire qualifications and are making themselves available to support fire response operations.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The federal government employs thousands of wildland firefighters, but the precise number is opaque. Throughout the Department of the Interior, which is overseen by Secretary Doug Burgum, there are about 5,800 wildland firefighters in four agencies that have been impacted by cuts. An employee at a national park in Colorado that is threatened by wildfire said that they were \u201cseverely understaffed during the Biden administration on most fronts, and now it\u2019s so much worse than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But the Forest Service is by far the largest employer of wildland firefighters, and it has long used gymnastic arithmetic to paint an optimistic picture of its staffing. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/wildfires-forest-service-firefighters-preparedness-level-five\">Last summer, ProPublica reported</a> that the Forest Service under President Joe Biden had overstated its capacity. Robert Kuhn, a former Forest Service official who between 2009 and 2011 co-authored an assessment of the agency\u2019s personnel needs, recently said that the practice of selectively counting firefighters dates back years. \u201cWhat the public needs to understand is, that is just a very small number of what is needed every summer,\u201d he said. Riva Duncan, a retired Forest Service fire chief and the vice president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a labor advocacy organization, said staffing is a constant frustration for managers on the ground. \u201cWe have engines that are completely unstaffed,\u201d said Duncan, who remains active in wildland firefighting, having worked in temporary roles this summer. \u201cWe have vacant positions in management.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That said, there is a difference this fire season from years past. Officials in the previous administration <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/wildland-firefighters\">publicly acknowledged the danger</a> presented by an exodus of experienced wildland firefighters. The Trump administration has taken a different approach \u2014 claiming to have solved the problem while simultaneously exacerbating it. When asked about the staffing cuts, Anna Kelly, a White House deputy press secretary, wrote, \u201cPresident Trump is proud of all Secretary Rollins has accomplished to improve forest management, including by ending the 2001 <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/06/23/secretary-rollins-rescinds-roadless-rule-eliminating-impediment-responsible-forest-management#:~:text=Secretary%20Rollins%20Rescinds%20Roadless%20Rule%2C%20Eliminating%20Impediment%20to%20Responsible%20Forest%20Management,-Press%20Release\">Roadless Rule</a> for stronger fire prevention, and Secretary Burgum\u2019s great work protecting our nation\u2019s treasured public lands.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In March, Congress finally codified a permanent raise for federal wildland firefighters via the appropriations process, a change that advocates have sought for years. In her remarks in June, Rollins credited the president: \u201cOut of gratitude for the selfless service of our Forest Service firefighters, President Trump permanently increased the pay for our federal wildland firefighters.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But in February, the Trump administration laid off about <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-doge-cuts-forest-service-firefighting\">700 employees</a> who support wildland fire operations, from human-resource managers to ecologists and trail-crew workers. Those employees possess what are known as red cards \u2014 certifications that allow them to work on fire crews. Many were subsequently rehired, but the administration then pushed Forest Service employees to accept deferred resignations and early retirements.</p>\n\n<p>Last month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to combine their firefighting forces. For the moment, it\u2019s unknown what form that restructuring will take, but many Forest Service firefighters are anticipating further staffing cuts. A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior wrote, \u201cWe are taking steps to unify federal wildfire programs to streamline bureaucracy.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Administration officials have maintained that employees primarily assigned to wildland fire were exempted from the resignation offers this spring. But according to another internal data set obtained by ProPublica, of the more than 4,000 Forest Service employees who accepted deferred resignations and early retirements, approximately 1,600 had red cards. (A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture wrote that the actual number was 1,400, adding that 85 of them \u201chave decided to return for the season.\u201d)</p>\n\n<p>Even those figures don\u2019t account for all the lost institutional knowledge. The departures included meteorologists who provided long-range forecasts, allowing fire managers to decide where to deploy crews. One of the meteorologists who left was Charles Maxwell, who had for more than 20 years interpreted weather models predicting summer monsoons at the Southwest Coordination Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, an interagency office. The thunderstorms can fuel wildfire, with lightning and wind, and extinguish them, with great rains. Lately, according to Maxwell, the monsoons have become less and less reliable, and understanding their nuances can be challenging. Maxwell said that he\u2019d already been planning to retire next year. But he also said he \u201cwas concerned with the degree of chaos, the potential degradation of services and what would happen to my job.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Maxwell noted that his work had been covered by knowledgeable fill-ins from out of state. But another firefighter who worked on blazes in New Mexico said that Maxwell\u2019s understanding of the monsoon had been missed. A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, which oversees the interagency office where Maxwell worked, wrote, \u201cWe do not comment on personnel matters.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The monsoon season is now here and has brought deadly flash flooding along old burn scars in Ruidoso, New Mexico, while distributing sporadic rain in the state\u2019s Gila National Forest.</p>\n\n<p>It is shaping up to be a severe fire season. On Monday, federal firefighters reported 86 new fires across the West; by Tuesday, there were 105 more. And there\u2019s already been some criticism of the federal response. Arizona\u2019s governor and members of Congress have called for an investigation into the Park Service\u2019s handling of a blaze this month that leveled a historic lodge on the Grand Canyon\u2019s North Rim. Last month, Rollins acknowledged, \u201cFires don\u2019t know Republican or Democrat, or which side of the aisle you are on.\u201d This much, at least, is true.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/ellis-simani\">Ellis Simani</a> contributed data analysis.</p>",

It could also, in time, require states to allow more launches or even more launch sites \u2014 known as spaceports \u2014 along their coastlines.</p>\n\n<p>The order is a step toward the rollback of federal oversight that Musk, who has fought bitterly with the Federal Aviation Administration over his space operations, and others have pushed for. Commercial rocket launches have grown exponentially more frequent in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Critics warn such a move could have dangerous consequences.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt would not be reasonable for them to be rescinding regulations that are there to protect the public interest, and the public, from harm,\u201d said Jared Margolis, a senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit that works to protect animals and the environment. \u201cAnd that\u2019s my fear here: Are they going to change things in a way that puts people at risk, that puts habitats and wildlife at risk?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The White House did not answer questions about the draft order.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Trump administration is committed to cementing America\u2019s dominance in space without compromising public safety or national security,\u201d said White House spokesperson Kush Desai. \u201cUnless announced by President Trump, however, discussion about any potential policy changes should be deemed speculation.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The order would give Trump even more direct control over the space industry\u2019s chief regulator by turning the civil servant position leading the FAA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/elon-musk-spacex-doge-faa-ast-regulation-spaceflight-trump\">Office of Commercial Space Transportation</a> into a political appointment. The last head of the office and two other top officials recently took voluntary separation offers.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The order would also create a new adviser to the transportation secretary to shepherd in deregulation of the space industry.</p>\n\n<p>The draft order comes as SpaceX is ramping up its ambitious project to build a reusable deep-space rocket to carry people to Earth\u2019s orbit, the moon and eventually Mars. The rocket, called Starship, is the largest, most powerful ever built, standing 403 feet tall with its booster. The company has hit some milestones but has also been beset by problems, as three of the rockets launched from Texas this year have exploded \u2014 disrupting air traffic and raining debris on beaches and roads in the Caribbean and Gulf waters.</p>\n\n<p>The draft order also seeks to restrict the authority of state coastal officials who have challenged commercial launch companies like SpaceX, documents show. It could lead to federal officials interfering with state efforts to enforce their environmental rules when they conflict with the construction or operation of spaceports.</p>\n\n<p>Derek Brockbank, executive director for the Coastal States Organization, said the proposed executive order could ultimately force state commissions to prioritize spaceport infrastructure over other land uses, such as renewable energy, waterfront development or coastal restoration, along the coastline. His nonprofit represents 34 coastal states and territories.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that it could potentially undermine the rights of a state to determine how it wants its coast used, which was the very fundamental premise of the congressionally authorized Coastal Zone Management Act,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t see any president, no matter what their party is, coming in and saying, \u2018This is what a state should prioritize or should do.\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<p>SpaceX is already suing the California Coastal Commission, accusing the agency of political bias and interference with the company\u2019s efforts to increase the number of Falcon 9 rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base. The reusable Falcon 9 is SpaceX\u2019s workhorse rocket, ferrying satellites to orbit and astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>\n\n<p>The changes outlined in the order would greatly benefit SpaceX, which launches far more rockets into space than any other company in the U.S. But it would also help rivals such as Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin and California-based Rocket Lab. The companies have been pushing to pare down oversight for years, warning that the U.S. is racing with China to return to the moon \u2014 in hopes of mining resources like water and rare earth metals and using it as a stepping stone to Mars \u2014 and could lose if regulations don\u2019t allow U.S. companies to move faster, said Dave Cavossa, president of the Commercial Space Federation, a trade group that represents eight launch companies, including SpaceX, Blue Origin and Rocket Lab.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt sounds like they\u2019ve been listening to industry, because all of those things are things that we\u2019ve been advocating for strongly,\u201d Cavossa said when asked about the contents of the draft order.</p>\n\n<p>Cavossa said he sees \u201csome sort of environmental review process\u201d continuing to take place. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about doing is right-sizing it,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>He added, \u201cWe can\u2019t handle a yearlong delay for launch licenses.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The former head of the FAA\u2019s commercial space office said <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/testimony/statement-kelvin-b-coleman-associate-administrator-commercial-space-transportation-faa-0\">at a Congressional hearing last September</a> that the office took an average of 151 days to issue a new license during the previous 11 years.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial space launches have boomed in recent years \u2014 from 26 in 2019 to 157 last year. <a href=\"https://explore.dot.gov/t/FAA/views/CommercialSpaceTransportation/Main?%3Aembed=y&amp;%3Aiid=1&amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y#1\">With more than 500 total launches</a>, mostly from Texas, Florida and California, SpaceX has been responsible for the lion\u2019s share, <a href=\"https://explore.dot.gov/t/FAA/views/CommercialSpaceTransportation/Main?%3Aembed=y&amp;%3Aiid=1&amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y#1\">according to FAA data</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But the company has tangled with the FAA, which last year proposed fining it $633,000 for violations related to two of its launches. The FAA did not answer a question last week about the status of the proposed fine.</p>\n\n<p>SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab and the FAA did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, the FAA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106193.pdf\">environmental reviews</a> look at 14 types of potential impacts that include air and water quality, noise pollution and land use, and provide details about the launches that are not otherwise available. They have at times drawn big responses from the public.</p>\n\n<p>When SpaceX sought to increase its Starship launches in Texas from five to 25 a year, residents and government agencies submitted thousands of comments. Most of the nearly 11,400 publicly posted comments opposed the increase, a ProPublica analysis found. The FAA approved the increase anyway earlier this year. After conducting an environmental assessment for the May launch of SpaceX\u2019s Starship Flight 9 from Texas, the FAA released documents that revealed as many as 175 airline flights could be disrupted and Turks and Caicos\u2019 Providenciales International Airport would need to close during the launch.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to seeking to cut short environmental reviews, the executive order would open the door for the federal government to rescind sections of the federal rule that seeks to keep the public safe during launches and reentries.</p>\n\n<p>The rule, referred to as Part 450, was approved during Trump\u2019s first term and aimed to streamline commercial space regulations and speed approvals of launches. But the rule soon fell out of favor with launch companies, which said the FAA didn\u2019t provide enough guidance on how to comply and was taking too long to review applications.</p>\n\n<p>Musk helped lead the charge. Last September, he told attendees at a conference in Los Angeles, \u201cIt really should not be possible to build a giant rocket faster than paper can move from one desk to another.\u201d He called for the resignation of the head of the FAA, who stepped down as Trump took office.</p>\n\n<p>Other operators have expressed similar frustration, and some members of Congress have signaled support for an overhaul. In February, Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., <a href=\"https://republicans-science.house.gov/_cache/files/f/7/f722d474-0997-430c-8cc3-7554c4dd5829/B6133FA0A66669E002C1F483872D2B627B4C1B724591D570E2C1E8B8504D0CEA.gao-letter-on-part-450---clean-25-02-12.pdf\">signed a letter asking</a> the Government Accountability Office to review the process for approving commercial launches and reentries.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>In their letter, Babin and Lofgren wrote they wanted to understand whether the rules are \u201ceffectively and efficiently accommodating United States commercial launch and reentry operations, especially as the cadence and technological diversity of such operations continues to increase.</p>\n\n<p>The draft executive order directs the secretary of transportation to \u201creevaluate, amend, or rescind\u201d sections of Part 450 to \u201cenable a diversified set of operators to achieve an increase in commercial space launch cadence and novel space activities by an order of magnitude by 2030.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The order also directs the Department of Commerce to streamline regulation of novel space activity, which experts say could include things like mining or making repairs in space, that doesn\u2019t fall under other regulations.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/brandon-roberts\">Brandon Roberts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/pratheek-rebala\">Pratheek Rebala</a> contributed data analysis.</p>",

    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/putin-echo-chamber-fails",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>Is anyone surprised that Russian President Vladimir Putin so badly overestimated his ability to continue to string along U.S. President Donald Trump? Shocked that Putin has once again become the victim of the echo chamber that he created for himself? Is anyone really surprised that Putin, who so badly miscalculated in February 2022 when he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has again made a serious strategic mistake by failing to take openings offered to him by the U.S. President to end the war in Ukraine?</p><p>Putin's failures are actually years in the making. After assuming power in the early 2000\u2019s, he surrounded himself with sycophants and \u201cloyal\u201d servants who were unwilling to give him bad news, and always ready to repeat the lies and distortions the Russian leader wanted to promote. Anyone who dared disagree with him was either thrown in jail, forced into exile or assassinated by the Russian \u201cstrongman\u201d. </p><p>As a result, in the run up to Putin\u2019s failed February 2022 effort to seize all of Ukraine, there is little doubt that his advisors parroted back to him the things he wanted to hear.  I can imagine what that sounded like. <em>\u201cThe Ukrainian people love Russia and will welcome Russian forces invading their country with \u2018Bread and Salt\u2019;\u201d \u201cUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a \u201cpuppet\u201d placed on his throne by Washington and his unpopular government is incapable of standing up to the great Tsar Vladimir;\u201d \u201cUkraine\u2019s western provided weapons are no match for Russia\u2019s incredible arsenal;\u201d \u201cUkraine\u2019s Armed Forces cannot stand up to the Russian Military, which is the best in the world;\u201d \u201cThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was a weak organization that would collapse under the weight of Moscow\u2019s greatness and would never stand up to Putin over Ukraine\u201d.</em> I could go on.</p><p>Instead of being met with \u2018Bread and Salt\u2019 in the winter of 2022, Russian forces were greeted with Javelins, Stingers, and Bayraktar Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and highly motivated Ukrainian forces that humiliated the Russians on the battlefield and stopped Moscow from achieving its initial objectives. More than three years later, the Russian people have suffered over a million Russian casualties and now face serious social and economic problems.</p><p>When President Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, it appeared Putin\u2019s echo chamber once again failed the Russian President, who was apparently convinced that he could deceive and manipulate Trump endlessly by pretending to want to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine, while continuing to launch attacks on Ukraine day and night.</p><p>For months, President Trump and his Administration tried to look past Putin\u2019s deceitful behavior. The U.S. president appeared willing to \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d when Putin blatantly insulted him by launching strikes while Trump\u2019s Special Envoy was in Moscow to \u201ctalk peace\u201d and Trump\u2019s emissaries were in Kyiv to encourage the Ukrainians to consider making compromises to end the war. Fueled by his own arrogance and lacking advisors around him who will speak the truth, Putin repeatedly insulted the U.S. president and the people who elected him to lead the United States. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong></em><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></em></u></a></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>If the Russians really understood what they were dealing with in President Trump, Putin would have known that there was a limit to what he could get away with vis-a-vis his American counterpart. Instead, his complete failure to understand the dynamics in the U.S. and Trump\u2019s own personality has finally led to the U.S. president turning a corner \u2014 recently announcing his support for continued military support to the Ukrainians in their fight to defend their country against Putin\u2019s aggression, and his willingness to seriously consider adopting secondary sanctions that will place increased pressure on the already struggling Russian economy. </p><p>Trump is calling Putin\u2019s bluff, and the Russian people will once again pay the price for their \u201cleader\u2019s\u201d lack of judgement and self-awareness.</p><p>For those Americans who support continued U.S. assistance to Ukraine and recognize that the loss of Ukraine to Putin will have dire consequences for the U.S. far beyond the battlefield, the U.S. president\u2019s recent shift in thinking is a very welcome sign that the White House understands that in any confrontation with Putin, the U.S. can and will demonstrate the fortitude and stamina needed to counter the Russian dictator\u2019s imperial ambitions and that Washington will not tolerate being insulted by Putin. </p><p>Continued supplies of defense weapons, the removal of Biden-era restrictions on how the Ukrainians can use U.S. weapons systems, and increased economic pressure on the Russian regime are all important steps that the U.S. can now take to demonstrate to Putin that he is wrong if he thinks he can bully the American people and their elected leaders. </p><p>But there is another tool that President Trump can also use to increase pressure on Putin \u2013 his own voice.</p><p>During the 2016 U.S. Presidential elections, then-candidate Trump openly spoke about his desire to forge better relations with Russia. After his election, he continued to try to improve relations with Moscow despite facing significant attacks from his political opponents in Washington. As a result, during Trump\u2019s first term in office he was very popular among the Russian people, who were hopeful that their government would take advantage of Trump\u2019s positive feelings about their country and take advantage of the opening Trump was offering to improve their lives. </p><p>After being re-elected to the White House in 2024, the Russians were once again offered an opportunity to reduce tensions with the U.S. and roll-back economic sanctions and the diplomatic isolation that have undermined the hopes many Russians had in the past of living a better life. Between January and June 2025, Trump offered Putin multiple openings to find an off-ramp to the costly war in Ukraine. Putin not only failed to take advantage of the opportunities presented by Trump, but he openly thumbed his nose at the U.S. president.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

His message then was clear \u2013 The United States is not your enemy.

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>\u201cGovernment has assured emaSwati [the Swazi people] that the arrival [in southern Africa Wednesday in Eswatini, formerly Swaziland] of five third-country deportees from the United States of America poses no security threat to the Nation. Government said these deportees are in transit and will be repatriated to their respective countries. Government has, however, acknowledged the security concerns of emaSwati, further confirming that indeed, the five prisoners are in the country and are housed in Correctional facilities within isolated units, where similar offenders are kept. The Nation is assured that these inmates pose no threat to the country or its citizens.\u201d</p><p>That was Eswatini government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli, confirming last week, the transfer from the U.S. of five immigrant criminals who were citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos.</p><p>Mdluli said their presence in Eswatini was \u201cthe result of months of robust high-level engagements between the U.S. Government and Eswatini,\u201d and that, \u201cThe two Governments will collaborate with the [United Nations] International Organization for Migration (IOM) to facilitate the transit of these inmates to their countries of origin.\"</p><p>Last Thursday, an IOM spokesperson said that the agency \u201cwas not involved in this operation and has not been requested to provide post-removal assistance,\u201d but \u201cas always, stands ready to support Member States.\u201d</p><p>The State Department\u2019s 2023 <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/eswatini/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Human Rights Repor</u></a>t's section on Eswatini noted \u201ccredible reports of: arbitrary or unlawful killings, including extrajudicial killings; torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government.\"</p><p>Last Wednesday, Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin described the five as \u201cindividuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back,\u201d adding, \u201cThese depraved monsters have been terrorizing American communities, but thanks to POTUS [President Trump] and [Homeland Security Secretary Kristi] Noem, they are off of American soil.\u201d</p><p>While much has been written about the law covering domestic activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) here in the U.S., there are still procedural questions about the Trump administration\u2019s decision to send migrant criminals to third countries, a move covered by different American laws and international conventions.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

No such agreement has been made public.  Some analysts suggest Eswatini may be trying to safeguard sugar exports to the U.S. \u2014 the small African country\u2019s fourth largest customer \u2014 from new Trump tariffs.</p><p>The Eswatini government has declined to say whether any money from Washington came as part of the deal. The question was raised because there was a $6 million U.S. payment acknowledged in the Trump administration\u2019s February 2025 arrangement with El Salvador, which involved sending up to 300 Venezuelan deportees to that country.</p><p>Money has also been raised because of the reputation of Eswatini\u2019s 57-year-old King Mswati III, the last remaining absolute monarch in Africa, who has a family that includes 15 wives. He is accused by human rights groups of enjoying a lavish lifestyle, while most of the country\u2019s 1.2 million people are impoverished.</p><p>Last Friday, <em><em>Newzroom Afrika</em></em>, South Africa's 24-hour digital television news channel, carried an interview with Ramza Matimela, the Secretary General of Swaziland Liberation Movement, who is now living in exile in Ireland. He said, \u201cWe know very well that we have got a greedy leader who wants to accumulate everything for himself\u2026Again, we have a government that is trying to please everyone at the expense of its own people.\u201d</p><p>Eswatini is not the only African country the Trump administration has approached to take migrant criminals. According to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/u-s-pushes-more-african-countries-to-accept-deported-migrants-b6f330c5?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiqTzuhk_XU-kJ-QrOHc3XDAG6Pr2Diy2wqy39Zc3xNgRPZ5YChuPrsWuSLDBw%3D&amp;gaa_ts=687ddbd4&amp;gaa_sig=dgp5qQydmBloKZcDTnExveJOIy3DJAMkMXkhl_v4K7huwa60s-5OqRYee2a2BW_205JeyOPtecnhMPu6JiLEDA%3D%3D\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></em></u></a>, the administration asked five West African countries to accept deportees from the U.S. whose home countries refused them or were slow to take them back \u2014 before their leaders met with Trump on July 9.</p><p>President Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 of Guinea Bissau said Trump discussed the topic during the summit, but did not specifically ask the African nations to agree to accept deportees, according to press reports.</p><p> On July 10, Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar said in an interview that his country had rejected a proposal from the U.S. to accept deported Venezuelans, including some with criminal records.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

They were convicted of serious crimes in the United States, though many had either finished or were about to finish serving their sentences. One was from South Sudan, but the others were from Cuba, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam. They were to be deported on May 20 to South Sudan, a war-torn country that recently emerged from civil war.</p><p>Take a moment to consider the legal situation and the laws involved.</p><p>Under the Immigration Act, the U.S. Government can conduct what is known as a \u201cthird country removal,\u201d to any country with a government that will accept the illegal alien. This is permissible if the individual will not be accepted by his/her country of origin. </p><p>The non-citizen facing removal, under domestic and international law, can claim, if given the opportunity, that there are substantial grounds that he/she would be in danger of torture or cruel punishment in the proposed third country.</p><p>On May 20, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts, who in April had issued a temporary restraining order that barred any migrant deportations from the U.S. to countries other than their own, held an emergency hearing on the South Sudan eight. At that hearing, a lawyer for the Vietnam deportee said his client was given less than 24 hours' notice of his removal, and had no ability to contest it in his native language.</p><p>It turned out that notice of their deportation was provided to the detainees at 5:45 p.m. for a 9:35 a.m. departure the next morning without access to an attorney.</p><p>The next day, Judge Murphy ruled that the South Sudan eight fell under his April order barring migrant deportations and that they should be held for interviews. As a result of Judge Murphy\u2019s order, the aircraft carrying the eight from Texas to South Sudan was diverted to an American military base in Djibouti, Africa. There the eight remained under guard for weeks while the Trump Administration took their case opposing Judge Murphy\u2019s restraining order on an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><p>On June 23, by a 6-to-3 vote, the Supreme Court Justices reversed Judge Murphy\u2019s order requiring the government to halt third country deportations until there was settlement on the pending legal issue that migrants are required to have a \"meaningful opportunity\" to tell officials what risks they might face being deported to a third country.</p><p>The Justices in the majority did not give their reasoning. But Justice Sotomayer, joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, wrote an 18-page dissent that in one part pointed out, \u201cRather than allowing our lower court colleagues to manage this high-stakes litigation with the care and attention it plainly requires [meaning the underlying issue of requiring a chance to challenge deportation], this Court now intervenes to grant the Government emergency relief from an order [Murphy\u2019s temporary restraining order] it has repeatedly defied. I cannot join so gross an abuse of the Court\u2019s equitable discretion.\u201d</p><p>I point out that while the South Sudan eight are now in that country facing an unknown fate, there remains the basic legal case at the District Court level of whether the U.S. Government is required by law to give potential third country deportees an opportunity to object.</p><p>As Justice Sotomayor put it, \u201cPlaintiffs alleged that the Government\u2019s apparent policy of removing noncitizens to a third country without notice or the opportunity to file a claim under the [International] Convention violated the immigration laws, the regulations implementing the Convention, and the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Among other things, plaintiffs sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief preventing their own removal and the removal of putative class members without adequate notice and a \u2018meaningful opportunity\u2019 to present a claim under the Convention.\u201d</p><p>I should point out again that one of the South Sudan eight was originally from that country, but on July 16, <em><em>New Yorker Magazine </em></em>reported that, \u201ctheir families have reportedly not heard from them since their arrival [July 8] in that country.</p><p>While those families still have a lot of questions, it's the legal answers that will have the most impact moving forward.</p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

He is set to be sentenced on Sept. 16 and faces 22 years to life.</p>\n        <p>According to prosecutors, on May 27, 2023, Timothy Taylor traveled to Schenectady, New York, from North Carolina and checked into a hotel at around 11 p.m. In the early hours of May 28, 2023, he reportedly entered a home and fatally stabbed his ex-wife while her three children were present. The defendant is reportedly the father of the two youngest children.</p>\n        <p>Taylor and his ex-wife were married for more than a decade. Prosecutors noted that there were numerous incidents of domestic violence during their marriage. At the time of the stabbing, Taylor had three pending charges out of Schenectady for criminal obstruction of breathing, criminal contempt, and harassment against his ex-wife.</p>\n        <p>The district attorney\u2019s office said Taylor then left the residence through a window, walked downtown, and threw away clothing on the way before leaving Schenectady.</p>\n        <p>At the time, the Brooklyn Homicide Squad was reportedly working to locate Taylor on suspicion of fatally stabbing his current wife on May 13, 2023. The case is still pending.</p>\n        <p>U.S. Marshals found Taylor at a bar in Philadelphia, and he was extradited to New York.</p>\n        <p>According to prosecutors, Taylor told detectives that \"after he had killed his then-current wife, he felt bad, and he knew he had to come to Schenectady to kill his former wife because he harbored so much animosity toward her,\" and she, \"unlike his first victim, deserved it.\"</p>\n        <p>In a statement, District Attorney Robert Carney said, \"People should know that Tishawn Folkes-Taylor, while facing down her killer and knowing his intent, made sure to protect her children, and after stabbing her more than 22 times, Mr. Taylor fled into the night without harming them.&nbsp;These children, particularly the oldest, who was a high school student at the time, and their extended family were instrumental to our office in bringing this case.\"</p>\n        <p><strong>MORE:</strong></p>\n        <ul><li><a href=\"https://archive.ph/tYH8u#selection-2549.0-2549.59\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Timothy Taylor Pleads Guilty to Murder in the Second Degree - Schenectady County District Attorney's Office</a></li></ul>",

Sign up for <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/newsletters/briefweekly/\">The Brief Weekly</a> to get up to speed on their essential coverage of Texas issues.</p>\n\n            \n\n                \n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n                    \n<p>Sixteen months had passed since Hurricane Harvey tore through the Texas coast in August 2017, killing more than 80 people and flattening entire neighborhoods. And when Texas lawmakers gathered in Austin for their biennial session, the scale of the storm\u2019s destruction was hard to ignore. </p>\n\n<p>Legislators responded by greenlighting a yearslong statewide initiative to evaluate flood risks and improve preparedness for increasingly frequent and deadly storms. \u201cIf we get our planning right on the front end and prevent more damage on the front end, then we have less on the back end,\u201d Charles Perry, a Republican senator from Lubbock who chairs a committee overseeing environmental issues, said at the time.</p>\n\n<p>In the years that followed, hundreds of local officials and volunteers canvassed communities across Texas, mapping out vulnerabilities. The result of their work came in 2024 with the release of <a href=\"https://www.twdb.texas.gov/flood/planning/sfp/2024/doc/SFP-2024.pdf\">Texas\u2019 first-ever state flood plan</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Their findings identified nearly $55 billion in proposed projects and outlined 15 key recommendations, including nine suggestions for legislation. Several were aimed at aiding rural communities like Kerr County, where flash flooding over the Fourth of July weekend killed more than 100 people. Three are still missing. </p>\n\n<p>But this year, lawmakers largely ignored those recommendations<strong>.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Instead, the legislative session that ended June 2 was dominated by high-profile battles over school vouchers and lawmakers\u2019 decision to spend $51 billion to maintain and provide new <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/06/04/texas-legislature-property-tax-cuts-2025/\">property tax cuts</a>, an amount nearly equal to the funding identified by the Texas Water Development Board, a state agency that has historically overseen water supply and conservation efforts.</p>\n\n<p>Although it had been only seven years since Hurricane Harvey, legislators now prioritized the state\u2019s water and drought crisis over flooding needs.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Legislators allocated <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/feeds/propublica/%20https:/www.texastribune.org/2025/05/27/texas-water-supply-infrastructure-deal-bill/\">more than $1.6 billion</a> in new revenue for water infrastructure projects, only some of which would go toward flood mitigation. They also passed a bill that will ask voters in November to decide whether to approve $1 billion annually over the next two decades that would prioritize water and wastewater over flood mitigation projects. At that pace, water experts said that it could take decades before existing mitigation needs are addressed \u2014 even without further floods.</p>\n\n<p>Even if they had been approved by lawmakers this year, many of the plan\u2019s recommendations would not have been implemented before the July 4 disaster. But a ProPublica and Texas Tribune analysis of legislative proposals, along with interviews with lawmakers and flood experts, found that the Legislature has repeatedly failed to enact key measures that would help communities prepare for frequent flooding. </p>\n\n<p>Such inaction often hits rural and economically disadvantaged communities hardest because they lack the tax base to fund major flood prevention projects and often cannot afford to produce the data they need to qualify for state and federal grants, environmental experts and lawmakers said.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, legislators have declined to pass at least three bills that would create siren or alert systems, tools experts say <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/07/11/kerr-county-flood-warning-system-sirens/\">can be especially helpful in rural communities</a> that lack reliable internet and cell service.  <a href=\"https://texasfloodassessment.org/doc/State-Flood-Assessment-report-86th-Legislation.pdf\">A 2019 state-commissioned report</a> estimated flood prevention needs at over $30 billion. Since then, lawmakers have allocated just $1.4 billion. And they ignored the key recommendations from the state\u2019s 2024 flood plan that are meant to help rural areas like Kerr County, which is dubbed \u201cFlash Flood Alley\u201d due to its geography.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, left, and U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, right, look on as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signs an emergency proclamation during a press conference in Kerrville.\n    \n            (Ronaldo Bola\u00f1os/The Texas Tribune)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Spokespeople for Gov. Greg Abbott and House Speaker Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock, did not answer questions about why the plan\u2019s recommendations were overlooked but defended the Legislature\u2019s investment in flood mitigation as significant. They pointed to millions more spent on other prevention efforts, including flood control dam construction and maintenance, regional flood projects, and increased floodplain disclosures and drainage requirements for border counties. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick did not respond to questions.</p>\n\n<p>This week, the Legislature will convene for a special session that Abbott called to address a range of priorities, including flood warning systems, natural disaster preparation and relief funding. Patrick <a href=\"https://x.com/americarpts/status/1942272990328283564?s=46&amp;t=5cO7LnTkSwhzxq4gxRk5sg\">promised that the state would purchase</a> warning sirens for counties in flash flood zones. Similar efforts, however, have previously been rejected by the Legislature. Alongside Burrows, Patrick also announced the formation of committees on disaster preparedness and flooding and <a href=\"https://www.ltgov.texas.gov/2025/07/10/texas-senate-and-texas-house-announce-creation-of-select-committees-on-disaster-preparedness-and-flooding/\">called the move</a> \u201cjust the beginning of the Legislature looking at every aspect of this tragic event.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/texas-news/texas-senate-house-committee-flood-warning-system/3885139/\">Burrows said</a> the House is \u201cready to better fortify our state against future disasters.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But Rep. Ana-Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez Ramos, a Democrat from Richardson, near Dallas, said state lawmakers have brushed off dire flood prevention needs for decades. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe manual was there, and we ignored it, and we've continued to ignore these recommendations,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez Ramos, who has served on the House Natural Resources Committee overseeing water issues for three sessions. \u201cIt\u2019s performative to say we\u2019re trying to do something knowing well we\u2019re not doing enough.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>One recommendation from the 2024 flood plan would have cost the state nothing to enact. It called for granting counties the authority to levy drainage fees, including in unincorporated areas, that could fund local flood projects. Only about 150 of 1,450 Texas cities and counties have dedicated drainage fees, according to a study cited in the state assessment.</p>\n\n<p>Kerr, a conservative county of 53,000 people, has struggled to gain support for projects that would raise taxes. About a week after the flooding, some <a href=\"https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2025/07/17/kerr-county-protesters-want-to-stop-possible-property-tax-increase-before-it-gets-started/\">residents protested</a> when county commissioners discussed a property tax increase to help cover the costs of recovery efforts. </p>\n\n<p>The inability to raise such fees is one of the biggest impediments for local governments seeking to fund flood mitigation projects, said Robert R. Puente, a Democrat and former state representative who once chaired the state committee responsible for water issues. Lawmakers\u2019 resistance to such efforts is rooted in fiscal conservatism, said Puente, who now heads the San Antonio Water System. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s mostly because of a philosophy that the leadership in Austin has right now, that under no circumstances are we going to raise taxes, and under most circumstances we\u2019re not even going to allow local governments to have control over how they raise taxes or implement fees,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Another one of the flood plan\u2019s recommendations called for lawmakers to allocate money for a technical assistance program to help underresourced and rural governments better manage flood prone areas, which requires implementing a slew of standards to ensure safe development in those hazardous zones. Doing this work requires local officials to collect accurate mapping that shows the risk of flooding. Passing this measure could have helped counties like Kerr with that kind of data collection, which the plan recognized is especially challenging for rural and economically disadvantaged communities. </p>\n\n<p>Insufficient information impacts Texas\u2019s ability to fully understand flood risks statewide. The water board\u2019s plan, for example, includes roughly 600 infrastructure projects across Texas in need of completion. But its report acknowledged that antiquated or missing data meant another 3,100 assessments would be required to know whether additional projects are needed.</p>\n\n<p>In the Guadalupe River region, which includes Kerr County, 65% of areas lacked adequate flood mapping. Kerrville, the county seat, was listed among the areas identified as having the \u201cgreatest known flood risks and mitigation needs.\u201d Yet of the 19 flood needs specific to the city and county, only three were included in the state plan\u2019s list of 600. They included requests to install backup generators in critical facilities and repair low-water crossings, which are shallow points in streets where rainwater can pool to dangerous levels.</p>\n\n<p>At least 16 other priorities, including the county\u2019s desire for an early warning flood system and potential dam or drainage system repairs, required a follow-up evaluation, according to the state plan. County officials <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/07/10/texas-kerr-county-commissioners-flooding-warning/\">tried to obtain grants for the early warning systems for years</a>, to no avail.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Trees uprooted by floodwaters lie across a field in Hunt in Kerr Country on July 5.\n    \n            (Brenda Baz\u00e1n for The Texas Tribune)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Gonzales County, an agriculture-rich area of 20,000 people along the Guadalupe River, is among the rural communities struggling to obtain funding, said emergency management director Jimmy Harless, who is also the county\u2019s fire marshal. The county is in desperate need of a siren system and additional gauges to measure the river\u2019s potentially dangerous flood levels, Harless said, but doesn\u2019t have the resources, personnel or expertise to apply for the \u201cburdensome\u201d state grant process. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is extremely frustrating for me to know that there\u2019s money there and there\u2019s people that care, but our state agency has become so bureaucratic that it\u2019s just not feasible for us,\u201d Harless said. \u201cOur folks\u2019 lives are more important than what some bureaucrat wants us to do.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>For years, Texas leaders have focused more on cleaning up after disasters than on preparing for them, said Jim Blackburn, a professor at Rice University specializing in environmental law and flooding issues.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the Guadalupe is prone to flash flooding. That\u2019s been known for decades,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cThe state has been very negligent about kind of preparing us for, frankly, the worst storms of the future that we are seeing today because of climate change, and what\u2019s changing is that the risks are just greater today and will be even greater tomorrow, because our storms are getting worse and worse.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>At a news conference this month, Abbott said state committees would investigate \u201cways to address this,\u201d though he declined to offer specifics. When pressed by a reporter about where the blame for the lack of preparedness should fall, Abbott responded that it was \u201cthe word choice of losers.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It shouldn\u2019t have taken the Hill Country flooding for a special session addressing emergency systems and funding needs, said Usman Mahmood, a policy analyst at Bayou City Waterkeeper, a Houston nonprofit that advocates for flood protection measures. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe worst part pretty much already happened, which is the flooding and the loss of life,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s a reaction to that.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Misty Harris contributed research.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION</strong> \u2014 Jesse Owens' historic gold medal victories at the 1936 Berlin Olympics exemplified American repudiation of Nazi ideology and Hitler\u2019s ambition for global dominance. Today, America needs to reframe its approach to the artificial intelligence (AI) race with China with the same mindset. President Xi Jinping envisions a world where the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) uses technological dominance to shape global governance, economic development, and limit individual freedoms that do not serve to empower the CCP. Said more directly \u2014 he wants to control the way we live and work to serve his interests.<br /><br />American policymakers a<sub></sub>nd technologists recognize this threat and frame it as an \"AI Race\" between the U.S. and China. They assert, correctly, that the U.S. must win\u2014but how? </p><p>ChatGPT estimates that the global dialogue about the \"AI Race\" focuses on performance, compute and energy (40-50%); geopolitical strategy and national security (10-15%); ethics, regulation, and AI safety (15-20%); economic and labor market impacts (10-15%); and consumer applications and societal use cases (5-10%). </p><p>To \u2018go for the gold\u2019 and win the AI race, the US must establish the demand signal and set adoption goals. We are in an AI-adoption race, not an AI-infrastructure race. Victory will be determined by how AI is embedded into the way we live, work, and fight. Americans should be asking:</p><ul><li>Will AI enable life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness or will AI limit speech and enhance government surveillance and authoritarian controls?</li><li>Will AI create new jobs, new industries, and previously unimaginable growth or will AI eliminate jobs and fundamentally disrupt the labor-based fabric of our economy?</li><li>Will AI promote peace by improving communication, collaboration, and conflict resolution, or will it incite war through decentralization of military capabilities and autonomous warfare?</li></ul><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><ul></ul><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Sign up for the </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Cyber Initiatives Group</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

They are outcome oriented. In his famous 1961 speech to Congress, President John F. Kennedy committed the nation to the ambitious goal of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth before the decade's end. His vision galvanized national support and spurred significant investment in NASA and space technology, ultimately propelling the U.S. to achieve the historic Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969. President Trump\u2019s impending AI Action Plan should set a similar vision.</p><p>In the race to the moon, the U.S. and Soviet Union poured resources into developing cutting-edge technologies, driven by the belief that victory would symbolize the superiority of their respective political and economic systems. America took advantage of the competition by driving unprecedented innovation that cemented America\u2019s lead in the world\u2014both militarily and commercially.<br /><br />Militarily, the U.S. created a robust and resilient arsenal of nuclear weapon delivery systems that deterred the Soviet Union from preemptive attack. Commercially, the impacts of the space race were wide-ranging:</p><ul><li>Texas Instruments played a key role in the development of integrated circuits and miniaturizing electronic components that laid the groundwork for modern computing and consumer electronics.</li><li>AT&amp;T developed advanced satellite communication technology, including the Telstar satellite, which enabled the first transatlantic television broadcasts and paved the way for global communications.</li><li>DuPont created Teflon, a non-stick coating originally used in spacecraft, which is now widely used in cookware and other applications.</li><li>General Electric made significant contributions to medical imaging technologies, including MRI machines, that have a lasting impact on diagnostic medicine.</li></ul><p>During the space race, the Soviets proved just as capable of achieving major breakthroughs and developing exquisite weapons. However, American dynamism won the Cold War, in part, because our citizens incorporated this technology into their everyday lives, while Soviet citizens queued in long lines for cars, washing machines and televisions. These natural benefits of a capitalist economy won\u2019t ensure victory. China learned from Soviet failures and subsidizes commercial production and adoption. Therefore, the U.S. must be even more ambitious at cultivating AI innovation and unleashing AI-driven opportunities to redefine the way we live and work.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em>Sign up today</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em>.</em></strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>Shifting the Paradigm: From Inputs to Impact</strong></p><p>As we reset our course to win the AI race, we must shift our focus from the intricacies of technological inputs to the broader societal impacts that AI can deliver. Just as the Space Race catalyzed innovation across multiple industries, the AI race presents an opportunity to redefine our geopolitical, economic, and social landscapes. To truly capitalize on this potential, the United States must prioritize outcomes that align with our core values of freedom, innovation, and human dignity. Our ambitions should be both bold and broad. Commercially we should set goals for:</p><ul><li><strong>Individualized Healthcare</strong>: AI-driven solutions that enhance patient care, streamline diagnostics, and personalize treatment plans should improve health outcomes, reduce costs, and increase accessibility to medical services. We should strive to cure cancer within a decade.</li><li><strong>Sustainable Agriculture:</strong> Farmers should use AI-optimized irrigation, pest control, and resource allocation to achieve food security and sustainability for all Americans.</li><li><strong>Advanced Manufacturing:</strong> AI-powered automation and predictive maintenance should power American industries and create 1 million new high-skilled jobs in the next five years.</li></ul><p>We should also set grand ambitions for AI-enabled government outcomes:</p><ul><li><strong>Education and Workforce Development:</strong> Teachers should use AI to tailor educational content and learning experiences to individual needs, ensuring that students and workers acquire the skills necessary for the future job market. The U.S. currently ranks in the middle of OECD countries in reading (13th), science (18th), and math (18th). We should set goals to be in the top 3 for all core subjects.</li><li><strong>Public Health and Safety:</strong> Medical and safety professionals should use AI to predict and manage public health crises, optimize resource allocation, and improve response times. AI can assist in early detection of disease outbreaks and enhance emergency response capabilities, ultimately protecting and improving public health. The U.S. should be ranked in the top 5 of global health system performance and efficiency rankings by 2030\u2014improving key health outcomes such as life expectancy. Wait times in emergency rooms should be eliminated.</li><li><strong>Smart Infrastructure</strong>: AI-enabled smart cities and smart towns will optimize traffic management, energy consumption, and public transportation systems. This can lead to more sustainable urban environments and improved quality of life for citizens. The U.S. should achieve 30% reductions in average commute times and crime rates while improving citizen satisfaction with government services by 50% within the decade. Imagine if the U.S. eliminated its almost 40,000 annual traffic deaths.</li><li><strong>Defense and National Security</strong>: Develop AI technologies that bolster all forms of national defense and intelligence capabilities. We can set many broad ambitions including: a Golden Dome, autonomous swarm drones, predictive and auto-reactive cyber defenses, adaptive camouflage and stealth, AI-powered real-time intelligence analysis, and AI-enabled military decision support and implementation.</li></ul><p><strong>A Vision for Victory</strong></p><p><strong></strong>The AI race will likely define what it\u2019s like to live in the 21st century. The path forward requires a commitment to bold ambitions and measurable goals that prioritize human dignity, innovation, and freedom. By focusing on outcomes, like getting to the moon, the U.S. will uplift individuals and communities, and create a world where AI amplifies the best of what humanity has to offer. In this race, the true victory will be measured not by the sophistication of our algorithms or the power of our machines but by the impact we have on the lives of people across the globe.</p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

Yet there are few headlines about Jama\u2019at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), and governments or counterterrorism experts don't seem to have a plan to stop them.</p><p>JNIM is now the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/08/jnim-militants-west-africa-sahel-terrorism/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">most powerful</a> terrorist organization in Africa, and among the most potent jihadist groups anywhere. Beyond its territorial conquests, JNIM fields an estimated 6,000 fighters, counts thousands more civilian supporters, and has established streams of revenue based on everything from extortion to drug trafficking to collecting ransom payments from kidnappings.</p><p>General Michael Langley, who leads the U.S. Africa Command, or AFRICOM, <a href=\"https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/35861/africom-commander-highlights-focus-on-counter-terrorism-partner-capacity-building-during-h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">testified to Congress</a> last month about the threat posed by JNIM. \u201cOur assessment indicates that, if left unchecked, these organizations will continue to grow, and their threat to regional stability, as well as to U.S. national security interests, will only intensify,\u201d Gen. Langley told the House Armed Services Committee. </p><p>As Gen. Langley spoke, the U.S. was contemplating a <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/03/03/2025/dismantling-us-africa-command-could-create-a-damaging-power-vacuum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thinning of AFRICOM</a>, following deep <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/africa/africa-usaid-funds.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cuts to USAID</a> programs in the region and a shift to a more transactional commercial relationship with Africa writ large.</p><p>\u201cThe situation [in West Africa] might end up becoming so bad that it will be impossible for the U.S. to ignore,\u201d Jacob Zenn, an Africa expert at the Georgetown Center for Security Studies, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cGeneral Langley was urging everyone to begin paying attention now, or else you're going to have to do it later when the situation is worse.\u201d</p><p>But because JNIM isn\u2019t perceived \u2013 for now \u2013 as a direct threat to the West, and because governments in West Africa are either disinclined or too weak to push back, the group\u2019s influence is spreading.</p><p>JNIM was <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/nctc/terrorist_groups/jnim.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">founded in Mali</a> in 2017 as a coalition of five jihadist groups, including the Sahara branch of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The group\u2019s leader, Iyad Ag Ghali, is a former Toureg separatist leader and Malian diplomat who is reported to have had a \u201cconversion\u201d to radical Islam during a visit to Saudi Arabia two decades ago.</p><p>Ag Ghali was expelled from the Malian government for his links to extremists, and soon after, he united the militant groups under the JNIM umbrella and pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. </p><p>JNIM began to gain momentum by seizing land and bringing terror to Mali, and then to neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso, in a series of ambushes and attacks against government forces, United Nations missions, and civilians.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

Burkina Faso has suffered the worst of the carnage \u2013 JNIM has carried out over 280 attacks in the country in the first half of 2025 alone, double the number from the same time in 2024. Overall, the <a href=\"https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-july-15/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">group has killed</a> more than 1,000 people across the Sahel region since April. </p><p>\u201cEach year we see the lethality of the conflict growing,\u201d Heni Nsaiba, West Africa Senior Analyst at Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cNot just in terms of fatalities\u2026but also in terms of the violence that the group employs to achieve their objectives.\u201d</p><p>Those objectives differ between JNIM\u2019s factions, Nsaiba said, but all share an ambition to impose hardline Islamic rule, and a willingness to use violence to further that goal. </p><p>\u201cSalafi-Jihadist ideology is the foundation of their governance approach,\u201d Levi West, a counterterrorism expert at the Australian National University, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cMuch like HTS in Syria and the Taliban in Afghanistan, this means minority, deeply conservative, and militant interpretations of Islam as the system of governance and the basis of laws.\u201d </p><p>Experts say the group\u2019s hold on territory has <a href=\"https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-july-15/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">roughly tripled</a> in the last three years, to cover areas of Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso that, taken together, are nearly five times the size of Texas. </p><p>\u201cThese are vast areas and include vast desert terrains as well,\u201d Zenn said. \u201cIt's sort of an insurgents\u2019 paradise. If you are able to hide in the desert and store your weapons in hidden places, store your finances in hidden places, [you can] then force the counter insurgents to come into the bush to find you and then ambush them.\u201d</p><p>Poverty and poor governance in the region have helped boost support for JNIM. Experts say a series of coups that brought military juntas to power in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso have only made a bad situation worse, as the juntas have used brute force in ways that have boosted support for JNIM.</p><p>One expert who asked to remain anonymous given security sensitivities in the region said, \u201cthe real problem is that the military juntas in power have decided to double down on some of the heavy-handed tactics that they've used to try to suppress the insurgency.\u201d Those tactics, he told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>, include an \u201cabusive, kick-the-door-down approach\u201d that has driven communities into the hands of the extremists. </p><p>As they capture territory, JNIM\u2019s fighters are piling up war booty along the way. Nsaiba said the group levies zakat or Islamic alms on the populations it controls, runs smuggling and kidnapping operations, and has pillaged state stockpiles of arms and ammunition \u2013 \u201cbasically everything they need to sustain their operations,\u201d Nsaiba said. \u201cAll combined, they have a quite solid war chest.\u201d</p><p>Nsaiba and other experts say JNIM now has the weapons and warfighting capabilities to capture more land \u2013 including cities \u2013 and pose threats to regional governments.</p><p>In his June testimony, <a href=\"https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/35861/africom-commander-highlights-focus-on-counter-terrorism-partner-capacity-building-during-h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gen. Langley warned</a> that the group is spreading to other parts of West Africa, and may threaten the region\u2019s coastline.</p><p>\u201cGen. Langley is right to worry about the spread,\u201d Zenn said, adding that JNIM has made inroads in Benin, Togo, and towards the borders of Cote D\u2019Ivoire, Senegal and Ghana \u2013 coastal nations which have been relatively safe. \u201cThis is the next area of its expansion,\" Zenn said. \u201cAnd unless these countries really develop strong preventative measures at their borders, there's a major risk that JNIM will continue its spread.\u201d </p><p>West African governments have mounted <a href=\"https://www.fpri.org/article/2025/03/counterterrorism-shortcomings-in-mali-burkina-faso-and-niger/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">counterterrorism operations</a> against JNIM. The U.S. has designated Ag Ghali a \u201cSpecially Designated Global Terrorist\u201d and has issued a multi-million dollar bounty and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has called for a regional response. So far, none of it has stopped the terror. </p><p>In fact, the JNIM threat is growing as the U.S. recalibrates its policy toward Africa. A posture that has long included military deployments, diplomatic efforts and USAID programs is now being scaled back, in favor of the U.S. administration\u2019s push to lessen its global military footprint.</p><p>Acknowledging the reduction in U.S. military and development aid to the region, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/west-african-coast-could-boost-revenue-for-jihadists-us-warns?srnd=phx-politics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gen. Langley struck</a> a balance in his testimony between the urgency of the threat and a message that West African nations must carry more of the security burden themselves. While he said the U.S. would continue to offer intelligence-sharing and capacity-building help, <a href=\"https://www.africom.mil/about-the-command/2025-posture-statement-to-congress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he added</a> that \u201cThe plan is theirs\u2026we don\u2019t push ourselves to invade on their sovereignty.\u201d </p><p>And at a May conference with African Defense Chiefs, <a href=\"https://www.sofx.com/africom-commander-warns-of-growing-terror-threat-from-africas-sahel-region/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gen. Langley</a> brought a blunt message. \u201cSome things that we used to do, we may not do anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cwe\u2019re asking you to step up and burden-share with us\u2026Our goal is not to do more for Africa. It\u2019s to help Africa do more for itself.\u201d</p><p>At a recent White House summit, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygqenwx78o\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">President Trump talked</a> about the \u201cincredible commercial opportunities\u201d in the West African countries who were invited to the summit \u2013 Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal \u2013 and asked their leaders to accept migrants deported from the U.S., a pitch that <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> said underscored \u201cthe overlap between the administration\u2019s <a href=\"https://semafor.com/s/iuXVWzRa2G?email=tgnagorski@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">aggressive deportation campaign and its foreign policy</a>.\u201d Not much was said about the terror threat or the recent U.S. aid cuts, which experts have warned will impact stability in Africa.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Sign up now for The Cipher Brief Nightcap newsletter to stay up to speed on the top national security stories of the day and what the experts say about them. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\">Sign up for your afternoon brief today</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Zenn noted that JNIM\u2019s terror, if unchecked, might actually lead to more migrants seeking to come to the U.S. from Africa. \u201cThe ramifications of these capitals in West Africa falling to jihadist groups, let alone these jihadist groups attacking the coastal West African states, as Gen. Langley mentioned, would involve increased migration, human trafficking, drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, and safe havens arriving for the training of other jihadist militants,\u201d he said. \u201cThe geopolitical fallout would end up being significant. </p><p>A core problem in building the case for greater western involvement is that experts doubt JNIM has either the capability or the ambition to strike the West. Zenn says the group has avoided attacks against international targets like hotels, in a calculated effort to avoid drawing in the U.S. or Europe. </p><p>\u201cIt would appear that their primary objective is local, arguably regional, but not global,\u201d West said. \u201cJNIM are detrimental to many things in Mali and the region, but their threat to international security is relatively limited\u2026It would appear that JNIM is really prioritizing the local jihad as their objective.\u201d </p><p>Nsaibia agreed that \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make the case that JNIM is a threat to the U.S. homeland, or even to Europe.\u201d</p><p>Gen. Langley, in his testimony to Congress, said that while JNIM lacked the capability to attack the United States, it might seek to do so in the future. </p><p>\u201cWithout a persistent presence in the Sahel, we are limited in the ability to monitor the expanding influence of terrorist organizations in the region,\u201d he said in his written testimony. Acknowledging the reduction in U.S. military and development aid to the region, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/west-african-coast-could-boost-revenue-for-jihadists-us-warns?srnd=phx-politics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gen. Langley stressed</a> the importance of intelligence sharing and capacity building to help these nations conduct independent operations against militants.</p><p><strong>The China and Russia factors</strong></p><p>The case many experts make for greater U.S. engagement in West Africa is less about a threat to the homeland, and more about a contest for influence with Russia and China.</p><p>Gen. Langley raised the issue in his testimony, noting that China\u2019s military is outspending AFRICOM about 100-to-1 in African countries. Russia is using surrogates like the Wagner Group (now rebranded as \u201cAfrica Corps\u201d) to increase its influence on the continent, and a Kremlin spokesperson said recently that Moscow would seek to boost its security alliances in Africa <a href=\"https://semafor.com/s/8nTWpMbXhi?email=tgnagorski@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">as Western powers retreat</a>. </p><p>\u201cAfrica is a nexus theater for the great-power competition [with China and Russia],\u201d <a href=\"https://www.stripes.com/theaters/africa/2025-06-10/africom-eucom-al-shabab%C2%A0isis-langley-18079031.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gen. Langley said,</a> and Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee that hosted the hearing, echoed the point. \u201cWe need to be putting more resources in AFRICOM to combat what China and Russia are doing,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.stripes.com/theaters/africa/2025-06-10/africom-eucom-al-shabab%C2%A0isis-langley-18079031.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rogers said,</a> \u201crather than looking at taking away attention and resources.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAfrica is a front line in strategic competition,\u201d West told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. He said that while Russia and China \u201care highly active and influential in the region and across Africa,\u201d the U.S. remains largely on the sidelines. </p><p>\u201cOne would hope that the U.S. and its Western allies would take measures to prevent the emergence of a jihadist-dominated area of contingent territory,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever there seem to be limited efforts being made to disrupt this from occurring.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

The result? I\u2019ve been cycling roughly six hours a week for months now. Generally, I watch a lot of sports: if there\u2019s football, rugby, tennis, boxing, NFL or cricket on, I\u2019ll watch it.

It\u2019s the final day of Robbins\u2019s first tour, this one to promote her latest book and viral sensation, The Let Them Theory \u2013 her tool for helping people detach from other people\u2019s dramas. Outside forces, she teaches, from annoying relatives to strangers in a traffic jam, are not in your control; nor are you responsible for what they do, feel or think (so&nbsp;long as they are not your children). It\u2019s a waste of time, energy and emotion to even try. Instead, you should just say to yourself: \u201cLet them.\u201d</p><p>Robbins is bounding around, sparkling with charisma and no-nonsense charm, first in a comfy tracksuit (available from her website for \u00a3150), then in boss-lady blazer and sexy denim. For nearly two hours, she commands the stage \u2013 occasionally joined by her two grown-up daughters, one of whom, Sawyer, is the book\u2019s co-author \u2013 and the women in the audience smile, nod, hug each other and cry. By the finale, when the confetti cannons go off and yellow ribbons rain down to Coldplay\u2019s booming A Sky Full of Stars, I have promised myself I will (in no particular order) lose my perimenopause tummy, be nicer to my children and care less what other people think. I am, I decide, beaming to myself, ready to change the trajectory of my life.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/19/mel-robbins-self-help-superstar-success-survival-silencing-critics\">Continue reading...</a>",

The arrangement, which was critical to Microsoft winning the federal government\u2019s cloud computing business a decade ago, relies on U.S. citizens with security clearances to oversee the work and serve as a barrier against espionage and sabotage.</p>\n\n<p>But these workers, known as \u201cdigital escorts,\u201d often lack the technical expertise to police the work of foreign engineers with far more advanced skills, ProPublica found.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier Friday, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence, cited ProPublica in a letter to Hegseth asking for details about which DOD contractors use Chinese personnel to maintain the department\u2019s information and computing systems.</p>\n\n<p>China poses \u201cone of the most aggressive and dangerous threats to the United States, as evidenced by its infiltrations of our critical infrastructure, telecommunications networks and supply chains,\u201d Cotton <a href=\"https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1946196464981459316\">wrote in the letter</a>, which he posted on X. \u201cDOD must guard against all potential threats within its supply chain, including those from subcontractors.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Since 2011, cloud computing companies like Microsoft that wanted to sell their services to the U.S. government had to establish how they would ensure that personnel working with federal data would have the requisite \u201caccess authorizations\u201d and background screenings. Additionally, the Defense Department requires that people handling sensitive data be U.S. citizens or permanent residents.</p>\n\n<p>This presented an issue for Microsoft, which relies on a vast global workforce with significant operations in India, China and the European Union.</p>\n\n<p>So the tech giant enlisted staffing companies to hire U.S.-based digital escorts, who had security clearances that authorized them to access sensitive information, to take direction from the overseas experts. An engineer might briefly describe the job to be completed \u2014 for instance, updating a firewall, installing an update to fix a bug or reviewing logs to troubleshoot a problem. Then, with little review, an escort would copy and paste the engineer\u2019s commands into the federal cloud.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trusting that what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t malicious, but we really can\u2019t tell,\u201d one escort told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>In an earlier statement in response to ProPublica\u2019s investigation, Microsoft said that its personnel and contractors operate in a manner \u201cconsistent with US Government requirements and processes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The company\u2019s global workers \u201chave no direct access to customer data or customer systems,\u201d the statement said. Escorts \u201cwith the appropriate clearances and training provide direct support. These personnel are provided specific training on protecting sensitive data, preventing harm, and use of the specific commands/controls within the environment.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Microsoft said it has an internal review process known as \u201cLockbox\u201d to \u201cmake sure the request is deemed safe or has any cause for concern.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Insight Global \u2014 a contractor that provides digital escorts to Microsoft \u2014 said it \u201cevaluates the technical capabilities of each resource throughout the interview process to ensure they possess the technical skills required\u201d for the job and provides training.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/doris-burke\">Doris Burke</a> contributed research.</p>",

Sign up to receive <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/the-big-story?source=54G&amp;placement=top-note&amp;region=national\">our biggest stories</a> as soon as they\u2019re published.</p>\n\n            \n\n                \n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n                    \n<p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is preparing to shut down seven major investigations and cases concerning alleged housing discrimination and segregation, including some where the agency already found civil rights violations, according to HUD records obtained by ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>The high-profile cases involve allegations that state and local governments across the South and Midwest illegally discriminated against people of color by placing industrial plants or low-income housing in their neighborhoods, and by steering similar facilities away from white neighborhoods, among other allegations. HUD has been pursuing these cases \u2014 which range from instances where the agency has issued a formal charge of discrimination to newer investigations \u2014 for as many as seven years. In three of them, HUD officials had determined that the defendants had violated the Fair Housing Act or related civil rights laws. A HUD staffer familiar with the other four investigations believes civil rights violations occurred in each, the official told ProPublica. Under President Donald Trump, the agency now plans to abruptly end all of them, regardless of prior findings of wrongdoing.</p>\n\n<p>Four HUD officials said they could recall no precedent for the plan, which they said signals an acceleration of the administration\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-hud-weakening-enforcement-fair-housing-laws\">retreat from fair housing</a> enforcement. \u201cNo administration previously has so aggressively rolled back the basic protections that help people who are being harmed in their community,\u201d one of the officials said. \u201cThe civil rights protections that HUD enforces are intended to protect the most vulnerable people in society.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In the short term, closing the cases would allow the local governments in question to continue allegedly mistreating minority communities, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. In the long term, they said, it could embolden local politicians and developers elsewhere to take actions that entrench segregation, without fear of punishment from the federal government.</p>\n\n<p>HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett declined to answer questions, saying \u201cHUD does not comment on active Fair Housing matters or individual personnel.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Three of the cases involve accusations that local governments clustered polluting industrial facilities in minority neighborhoods. </p>\n\n<p>One concerned a protracted <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/13052023/chicago-hud-settle-environmental-racism-case-as-lori-lightfoot-leaves-office/\">dispute over a scrap metal shredding plant</a> in Chicago. The facility had operated for years in the largely white neighborhood of Lincoln Park. But residents complained ceaselessly of the fumes, debris, noise and, occasionally, smoke emanating from the plant. So the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250114225712/https:/www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Main/documents/Letter_of_Finding_05-20-0419_City_of_Chicago.pdf\">city allegedly pressured</a> the recycling company to close the old facility and open a new one in a minority neighborhood in southeast Chicago. In 2022, HUD found that \u201crelocating the Facility to the Southeast Site will bring environmental benefits to a neighborhood that is 80% White and environmental harms to a neighborhood that is 83% Black and Hispanic.\u201d Chicago\u2019s mayor called <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/7/22/23274612/lori-lightfoot-showdown-hud-housing-urban-development-federal-funding-homelessness-aids\">allegations of discrimination \u201cpreposterous,\u201d</a> then <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/5/12/23720343/hud-environmental-racism-lightfoot-general-iron-environmental-justice-housing-urban-development\">settled the case and agreed to reforms</a> in 2023. (The new plant has not opened; its owner <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/environment/2025/02/21/general-iron-lawsuit-seeks-millions-chicago-permit-denial-brandon-johnson-pollution\">has sued</a> the city.)</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.nhlp.org/wp-content/uploads/Flint-HUD-complaint-2021.pdf\">another case</a>, a predominantly white Michigan township <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/in-depth/news/local/michigan/2021/12/30/michigan-environmental-justice-pollution-permitting-egle-epa/8888962002/\">allowed an asphalt plant</a> to open on its outskirts, away from its population centers but near subsidized housing complexes in the neighboring poor, mostly Black city of Flint. The township did not respond to a ProPublica inquiry about the case.</p>\n\n<p>Still another case involved <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.caller.com/story/news/local/2025/03/27/city-of-corpus-christi-granted-third-major-permit-for-desalination-plant-inner-harbor/82687294007/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiW7cfS5cKOAxWav4kEHc-aLgYQFnoECBkQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1qBpH2yi4PXZI1SkDjRO61\">a plan pushed</a> by the city of Corpus Christi, Texas, to build a water desalination plant in a historically Black neighborhood already fringed by oil refineries and other industrial facilities. (Rates of cancer and birth defects in the area are disproportionately high, and average life expectancy is 15 years lower than elsewhere in the city, <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/inner_harbor_title_vi_complaint_oct26_final.pdf\">researchers found</a>.) The city denied the allegations. Construction of the plant is expected to conclude in 2028.</p>\n\n<p>Three other cases involve allegations of discrimination in municipal land use decisions. In Memphis, Tennessee, the city and its utility <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250225120632/https:/www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/FHEO/documents/City-of-Memphis-Charge-Redacted.pdf\">allegedly coerced residents</a> of a poor Black neighborhood to sell their homes so that it could build a new facility there. In Cincinnati, the city has <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24487946-hud-complaint-v-cincinnati-2024/?responsive=1&amp;responsive=false&amp;sidebar=false&amp;title=1%3Fembed=true\">allegedly concentrated</a> low-income housing in poor Black neighborhoods and kept it out of white neighborhoods. And in Chicago, the city has given local politicians <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/07/08/hud-affordable-housing-aldermanic-prerogative-discrimination-brandon-johnson\">veto power</a> over development proposals in their districts, resulting in little new affordable housing in white neighborhoods. (Memphis, its utility and Chicago have disputed the allegations; Cincinnati declined to comment on them.)</p>\n\n<p>The last case involved a Texas state agency allegedly <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-hud-texas-housing-discrimination-cases-dallas-houston\">diverting $1 billion</a> in disaster mitigation money away from Houston and other communities of color hit hard by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and toward more rural, white communities less damaged by the storm. The agency has disputed the allegations.</p>\n\n<p>All of the investigations and cases are now slated to be closed. HUD is also planning to stop enforcing the settlement it reached in the Chicago recycling case, the records show.</p>\n\n<p>The move to drop the cases is being directed by Brian Hawkins, a recent Trump administration hire at HUD who serves as a senior adviser in the Fair Housing Office, two agency officials said. Hawkins has no law degree or prior experience in housing, according to his LinkedIn profile. But this month, he circulated a list within HUD of the seven cases that indicated the agency\u2019s plans for them. In the cases that involve Cincinnati, Corpus Christi, Flint and Houston, the agency would \u201cfind no cause on [the] merits,\u201d the list reads. In the two Chicago cases and the one involving Memphis, HUD would rescind letters documenting the agency\u2019s prior findings. Hawkins did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>The list does not offer a legal justification for dropping the cases. But Hawkins also circulated a memo that indicates the reasoning behind dropping one \u2014 the Chicago recycling case. The memo cites an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-equality-of-opportunity-and-meritocracy/\">executive order</a> issued by Trump in April eliminating federal enforcement of \u201cdisparate-impact liability,\u201d the doctrine that seemingly neutral policies or practices could have a discriminatory effect. Hawkins\u2019 memo stated that \u201cthe Department will not interpret environmental impacts as violations of fair housing law absent a showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d Four HUD officials said such a position would be a stark departure from prior department policy and relevant case law.</p>\n\n<p>The reversal on the Chicago recycling case also follows behind-the-scenes pressure on HUD from Sen. Jim Banks. In June, Banks, a Republican from Indiana, wrote a letter to HUD Secretary Scott Turner and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin in which he criticized the administration of President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the case as \u201cbrazen overreach.\u201d Noting that the Chicago plant would supply metal to Indiana steel mills, Banks asked the Trump appointees to \u201ctake any actions you deem necessary to remedy the situation.\u201d Banks did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>That case and others among the seven had also received scrutiny from other federal and state agencies, including the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice. The EPA declined to say whether it was still pursuing any of the cases. The DOJ did not respond to the same inquiry.</p>\n\n<p>The case closures at HUD would be the latest stage in a broad rollback of fair housing enforcement under the Trump administration, which <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-hud-weakening-enforcement-fair-housing-laws\">ProPublica reported on previously</a>. That rollback has continued in other ways as well. The agency recently initiated a plan to transfer more than half of its fair housing attorneys in the office of general counsel into unrelated roles, compounding prior staff losses since the beginning of the year, four HUD officials told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>The officials fear long-lasting ramifications from the changes. \u201cFair housing laws shape our cities, shape where housing gets built, where pollution occurs, where disaster money goes,\u201d one official said. \u201cWithout them, we have a different country.\u201d</p>",

He was afraid the same would happen to him.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cJust in case something happens to me, so you can be aware.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Uncertain about his fate, Ramos wanted to make sure there was a record of what happened to him.</p>\n\n<p>A month later, he was gone.</p>\n\n<p>Ramos never set foot in the U.S. \u2014 at least not as a free man. He left Venezuela in January 2024, hoping to earn enough money to pay for his newborn son\u2019s medical needs. Born with a respiratory condition, the family\u2019s \u201cmilagrito,\u201d or \u201clittle miracle,\u201d had severe asthma and repeatedly needed to be hospitalized. The cost of treatment had become impossible to manage on the meager wages Ramos made washing cars in Venezuela\u2019s collapsed economy, so he trekked thousands of miles through a half dozen countries to reach the U.S. border.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>When Ramos arrived, he didn\u2019t sneak into the country. He followed the rules established by the Biden administration for immigrants seeking asylum. He signed up for an appointment through a government app and, when he was granted one, turned himself in to request protection. An immigration official and a judge determined he didn\u2019t qualify, and Ramos didn\u2019t fight the decision.</p>\n\n<p>The government kept him in detention until he could be deported back to Venezuela. </p>\n\n<p>In the months that followed, Donald Trump was elected president for a second term and began his mass deportation campaign. Among his first actions was to fly groups of Venezuelan immigrants whom he had labeled dangerous gang members to a U.S. military base at <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-administration-migrants-guantanamo-bay\">Guantanamo Bay, Cuba</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Ramos, 30, panicked and called his wife to say he was worried that the same was going to happen to him. On a video call his wife recorded, he held up a document he said was proof that immigration authorities had agreed to deport him to Venezuela. But he worried that they would not honor that promise.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cI have a family,\u201d he said, staring directly into the camera. \u201cI am simply a hard-working Venezuelan. I haven\u2019t committed any crimes. I don\u2019t have a criminal record in my country nor anywhere else.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A month later, a more upbeat Ramos called again. He seemed confident that U.S. officials would send him home. Ramos\u2019 family started preparing for his return. They planned to bake him a cake, cook his favorite chicken dish and go to church together to thank God for bringing him home safely.</p>\n\n<p>They never heard from him again.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n\n                            \n                                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n\n            First image: Bastidas rests with Ramos\u2019 son and her grandson, Jared, at their home in Venezuela. Second image: Rodr\u00edguez holds her phone, showing a photo of her husband.\n    \n            (Adriana Loureiro Fern\u00e1ndez for ProPublica and The Texas Tribune)\n    \n    \n    \n\n            \n                    \n    \n                    \n<p>On March 15, a day after that call, Ramos and more than 230 other Venezuelan men were sent to the CECOT maximum-security prison in El Salvador, one of the most notorious in the Western Hemisphere. Without publicly providing evidence, the administration accused each of them of being members of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan prison gang it designated a terrorist organization.</p>\n\n<p>In the months since the mass deportation \u2014 one of the most consequential in recent history \u2014 the Trump administration has released almost no details about the backgrounds of the people it deported, calling them \u201cmonsters,\u201d \u201csick criminals\u201d and the \u201cworst of the worst.\u201d Several news organizations have reported that most of the men did not have criminal records. ProPublica, The Texas Tribune and a team of Venezuelan journalists from Alianza Rebelde Investiga (Rebel Alliance Investigates) and Cazadores de Fake News (Fake News Hunters) went further, finding that the government\u2019s own records showed that it <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-el-salvador-deportees-criminal-convictions-cecot-venezuela\">knew the vast majority of the men</a> had not been convicted of violent crimes in the U.S. We also searched records in South America and found that only a few had committed violent crimes abroad.</p>\n\n<p>Now, a case-by-case examination of each of the deportees, along with interviews with their lawyers and family members, reveals another jarring reality: Most of the men were not hiding from federal authorities but were instead moving through the nation\u2019s immigration system. They were either in the middle of their cases, which normally should have protected them from deportation, or they had already been ordered deported and should have first been given the option to be sent back to a country they chose.</p>\n\n<p>Like Ramos, more than 50 of the men had used the government app called CBP One to make an appointment with border officials to try to enter the country. Others had crossed illegally and then surrendered to border agents, often the first step in seeking asylum in immigration court. </p>\n\n<p>According to our analysis, almost half of the men were deported even though their cases hadn\u2019t been decided yet. More than 60 of them had pending asylum claims, including several who were only days away from a hearing where a judge could have ruled on whether they would be allowed to stay. Judges or federal officials had issued deportation orders for about 100 of the men, and a handful had even agreed to pay their own way home. Others, like Ramos, had spent their entire time in the U.S. in detention. They had no opportunity to commit crimes in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, many of those who were allowed into the country had been appearing at their court hearings and immigration check-ins. At least nine had been granted temporary protected status, which gives people from countries affected by disasters or other extraordinary conditions permission to live and work in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>By and large, these were men who had been playing by the rules of the country\u2019s immigration system.</p>\n\n<p>Then, the Trump administration changed the rules.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n                                \n            \n        \n\n    \n\n            Rodr\u00edguez reviews the video she recorded of her husband before he was sent to CECOT, a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.\n    \n            (Alejandro Bonilla Su\u00e1rez for ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>A day before the administration deported the men to El Salvador, Trump invoked an obscure 18th-century law called the Alien Enemies Act and declared that Tren de Aragua was invading the country. Administration officials argued that the declaration authorized them to take extraordinary measures to remove anyone it had determined was a member of the gang and to make sure they would not threaten the U.S. again.</p>\n\n<p>Following the March 15 deportations, the Trump administration moved to shut down their pending immigration cases. Since then, more than 95 cases have been dismissed, terminated or otherwise closed by judges, according to our analysis. They disappear from the dockets, some marked as dismissed just hours before a scheduled hearing. </p>\n\n<p>Michelle Bran\u00e9, who served as a senior Department of Homeland Security official in the Biden administration, said it was \u201cvery un-American\u201d to deport people who followed the immigration rules at the time. \u201cYou can\u2019t retroactively say that those people were acting illegally and now punish them for that,\u201d she added. </p>\n\n<p>Lawyers for the Venezuelan men have filed several lawsuits against the administration, calling the summary removals from the country a gross violation of their clients\u2019 rights. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled in June that the move deprived the men of their constitutional rights and called their plight <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436.148.0_1.pdf\">Kafkaesque</a>. He wrote that the men \u201cnever had any opportunity to challenge the Government\u2019s say-so,\u201d and that they \u201clanguish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The government has appealed the ruling.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Ramos\u2019 mother, Cris\u00e1lida del Carmen Bastidas de Ramos, waits anxiously for any news about her oldest child. \u201cWhat is my son thinking? Is my son eating well? Is my son sleeping? Is he cold?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIs he alive?\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Rodr\u00edguez plays with her son at their home in Venezuela.\n    \n            (Adriana Loureiro Fern\u00e1ndez for ProPublica and The Texas Tribune)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Although the Trump administration routinely describes the men as criminals and terrorists, it has not provided evidence to support the claim. Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at DHS, defended sending them to the Salvadoran prison. \u201cThey may not have criminal records in the U.S., beyond breaking our laws to enter the country illegally,\u201d she said in a statement, \u201cbut many of these illegal aliens are far from innocent.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>For example, she said one of the TPS holders sent to El Salvador admitted he had previously been convicted of murder. We obtained Venezuelan court records confirming that the man had been convicted of murder and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. McLaughlin said his case proved that immigrants had been granted status in the U.S. under Biden without being thoroughly vetted. Three former DHS officials from the Biden administration said the vetting process has remained standard across administrations, including during the first Trump term, and that many governments do not share criminal background histories with U.S. officials.</p>\n\n<p>Trump has moved to strip TPS protections from hundreds of thousands of people.</p>\n\n<p>Ramos, McLaughlin said, was a terrorist who was flagged as a Tren de Aragua member in a law enforcement database at his CBP One appointment. His family denies he has anything to do with the gang. His lawyers said in court records that U.S. authorities wrongly identified him as a gang member based on his tattoos and an \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d report from Panamanian officials. A spokesperson for the Panamanian security ministry said he could not locate any documents about Ramos.</p>\n\n<p>At least 163 men who were deported had tattoos, we found. Law enforcement officials in the U.S., Colombia, Chile and Venezuela with expertise in the Tren de Aragua told us that tattoos are not an indicator of gang membership.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Albert Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez Parra had applied for asylum and worked at Chicago\u2019s Wrigley Field before he was detained in November. He was deported to El Salvador in March, where he remains imprisoned.\n    \n            (Courtesy of the Cook County public defender\u2019s office in Chicago)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Days before Albert Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez Parra was whisked away, he appeared in immigration court and tried to convince a judge that his tattoos did not mean he was part of the gang.</p>\n\n<p>He had come to the U.S. with a brother in 2023, applied for asylum and settled in Chicago. He told his mother that it was difficult to find work, but that he\u2019d gotten an electric razor, learned to cut hair and offered trims on the street. In January 2024, he was arrested at a Walmart in the Chicago suburbs for shoplifting about $1,000 worth of food, laundry detergent, shampoo and other items. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, served a two-day jail sentence and tried to move on. </p>\n\n<p>Rodr\u00edguez Parra, 28, got a job working in concessions at Wrigley Field, moved in with his girlfriend and sent money home to his mother to buy a refrigerator and a stove. Then, in November, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents picked him up at his apartment. McLaughlin said he was in the country illegally and was a Tren de Aragua member. Rodr\u00edguez Parra continued his asylum case from immigration detention in Indiana. </p>\n\n<p>He told his family he believed he would be released soon. But in early March, he was transferred to a jail in Missouri, then to one in Central Texas, then another in Laredo, in South Texas, each move bringing him closer to the border. Uncertainty began creeping into his calls home.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the transfers, Rodr\u00edguez Parra\u2019s attorney, Cruz Rodriguez, who works for a small immigration unit at the Cook County public defender\u2019s office in Chicago, said he was confident in the merits of the asylum case. He felt optimistic when he logged into his client\u2019s virtual bond hearing before Judge Eva Saltzman on March 10.  </p>\n\n<p>At the hearing, a government attorney asked Rodr\u00edguez Parra about a TikTok video he\u2019d made of himself dancing to a popular audio clip of someone shouting, \u201cTe va agarrar el Tren de Aragua,\u201d which means, \u201cThe Tren de Aragua is going to get you.\u201d Close to 60,000 users on TikTok have shared the clip. </p>\n\n<p>Rodr\u00edguez Parra scoffed at the notion that a real gang member would make such a video. \u201cIt would be like they were outing themselves,\u201d he said in Spanish. The audio clip has been used by Venezuelans to ridicule the widespread suggestion that everyone from the country is a gangster.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n    \n        <p>\n            <strong><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/help-propublica-report-venezuelans-deported-cecot\">Do You Have Information About the CECOT Deportations? Help ProPublica Report.</a></strong>\n        </p>\n\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The government attorney also asked Rodr\u00edguez Parra about the tattoos that covered his neck, arms and chest \u2014 a rose, a wolf, carnival masks and an angel holding a gun. \u201cIn my country, it\u2019s very normal to have tattoos,\u201d he responded. \u201cEach one represents a story about my life.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He was also questioned about a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member who had crossed the border at the same time as him. Rodr\u00edguez Parra said he did not know the man.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the hearing, he pleaded with the judge to free him on bond. \u201cI\u2019m a good person,\u201d he told her. \u201cIf I was in a gang, I wouldn\u2019t have applied for asylum. I came fleeing my country.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Saltzman denied Rodr\u00edguez Parra\u2019s request, citing his shoplifting conviction. But she offered him a sliver of hope, reminding him that his final hearing was just 10 days away. If she granted him asylum, he\u2019d be released and could continue his life in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not facing a particularly lengthy detention without a bond,\u201d she told him.</p>\n\n<p>Five days later, he was gone. At what was supposed to be his final asylum hearing on March 20, Rodr\u00edguez Parra\u2019s lawyer sounded despondent. He had barely slept. He didn\u2019t know where the authorities had taken his client, but he\u2019d seen a video posted online of shackled men being frog-marched into CECOT. The attorney had visited El Salvador and was aware of that country\u2019s reputation for mistreating prisoners. He feared his client would face a similar fate.</p>\n\n<p>He felt powerless. At the hearing, he turned to the government lawyer on the call. \u201cFor his family\u2019s sake,\u201d he told her, \u201cwould you happen to know what country he was sent to?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The government\u2019s lawyer had little to say.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m operating under the same information as you,\u201d she responded. \u201cI have no further information to provide.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><strong>Update, July 18, 2025:</strong> More than 230 men the Trump administration sent to a prison in El Salvador were returned to Venezuela on Friday in a prisoner swap. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted on X that he had handed over all of the men. In exchange, he said, a \u201cconsiderable number of Venezuelan political prisoners\u201d and Americans held by Venezuela were freed. The Trump administration had accused the men of being members of a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also confirmed the exchange.</p>\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Design and development by <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/anna-donlan\">Anna Donlan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/allen-tan\">Allen Tan</a> of ProPublica. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/Agnel-Philip\">Agnel Philip</a> of ProPublica contributed data reporting. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/gabriel-sandoval\">Gabriel Sandoval</a> of ProPublica contributed research.

That story also became an episode of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/577/something-only-i-can-see\">This American Life</a>.\u201d</p>\n\n        \n\n    \n      \n  \n\n\n\n                    \n<p>Jill Dopf Viles \u2014 self-taught genetic detective, the central figure in <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/muscular-dystrophy-patient-olympic-medalist-same-genetic-mutation\">the most interesting story I\u2019ve ever reported</a> and my friend \u2014 passed away last month in Gowrie, Iowa, at 50.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m heartbroken that Jill did not live to see the publication of her book \u2014 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/manufacturing-my-miracle-9781538197226/\">Manufacturing My Miracle: One Woman\u2019s Quest to Create Her Personalized Gene Therapy</a> \u2014 which came out last week. I know how much she treasured the fact that she would soon be able to call herself \u201cauthor.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Here is a paragraph from her book:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEvery gain I\u2019d made in learning more about my genetic disease had involved some type of deception \u2014 to do my family\u2019s underground blood draw in 1996 required that phlebotomy supplies be lifted from a hospital and a nurse secretly visit our home; gaining journalist David Epstein\u2019s interest began with a wild exaggeration in my email subject line: \u2018Woman with muscular dystrophy, Olympic Medalist\u2014same mutation\u2019; and I\u2019d adopted the lexicon of a research scientist to gain a client rate for Priscilla\u2019s genetic testing (the cost for clients was half what was charged to individual patients).\u201d</p>\n\n<p>If I was deceived, I\u2019m grateful for it. In that paragraph, Jill is describing just a bit of the effort that went into figuring out that she had a rare form of muscular dystrophy called Emery-Dreifuss, which causes muscle wasting, and also an even rarer form of partial lipodystrophy, which causes fat to vanish from certain parts of the body. Jill had been told for years that she didn\u2019t have either of these, never mind both.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>After my first book, \u201cThe Sports Gene,\u201d came out in 2013, I was on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d talking about genetics, and Jill happened to be within earshot of her TV. \u201cI thought, oh, this is divine providence,\u201d Jill later told me. So she sent me that email with the provocative subject line. She followed up by sending me a batch of family photos and a bound packet outlining her theory: that she and Canadian sprinter Priscilla Lopes-Schliep \u2014 bronze medalist in the 100-meter hurdles at the 2008 Olympics \u2014 shared a genetic mutation.</p>\n\n<p>On the face of it, this seemed ridiculous. One could hardly find a picture of two more different women. Take a look at this page from the packet Jill sent me:</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The packet outlined in granular detail why Jill thought, just from looking at pictures of Priscilla, that the two women shared a genetic mutation that caused the same fat wasting, but because Priscilla didn\u2019t also have muscle wasting \u2014 quite the contrary \u2014 her body had found some way to \u201cgo around\u201d muscular dystrophy.</p>\n\n<p>If Jill was right, she thought, perhaps scientists could study both of them and figure out how to help people with muscles like Jill\u2019s develop muscles a little closer to Priscilla\u2019s end of the human physique spectrum. Jill was sharing all this with me because she wasn\u2019t sure how best to contact Priscilla and hoped I would facilitate an introduction.</p>\n\n<p>Jill\u2019s hypothesis struck me as unlikely, to say the least. But her presentation in the packet was so interesting, and her knowledge of the underlying genetics and physiology so thorough, that I felt her idea deserved a hearing. I reached out to Priscilla; she agreed to meet Jill, and after comparing body parts in a hotel lobby, Jill convinced her to get a genetic test. Long story short, Jill turned out to be right. She and Priscilla had a mutation in the same gene, albeit at neighboring locations.</p>\n\n<p>The discovery led Priscilla to get urgent care for a serious health condition that had previously been overlooked because of her obvious fitness. Jill and I shared this story in an <a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/577/something-only-i-can-see\">episode of \u201cThis American Life\u201d in 2016</a> \u2014 which was rerun last week in her honor.</p>\n\n<p>After that story ran, Jill\u2019s genome became the subject of research, exactly as she\u2019d hoped. Today, in a lab in Iowa, there are fruit flies known as \u201cJill\u201d flies, because they have been engineered to carry her same mutation. As expected, Jill flies have severely limited mobility. But just recently, a scientist conducted a genetic experiment in which she increased the production of a particular protein in the Jill flies. Suddenly, they began to move like normal fruit flies.</p>\n\n\n<p>The breadth of life contained in <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/manufacturing-my-miracle-9781538197226/\">Jill\u2019s new book</a> is incredible.</p>\n\n<p>She was a child the first time she heard a doctor discussing her own death with her mother. The indignities of adolescence and young adulthood that she endured were legion, starting with spontaneous falls in school, followed by kids looping their fingers around her arms and legs and asking if her mother fed her.</p>\n\n<p>Jill\u2019s condition accelerated with puberty, so the bodily changes that are confusing for any teenager were absolutely harrowing for her. Almost overnight she lost the ability to do things she loved, like skate or ride a bike.</p>\n\n<p>At one point in her early teen years, a doctor ordered pictures of Jill\u2019s posture, which forced her into a strange and humiliating photo session that hadn\u2019t been properly explained beforehand:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI had seen these photos before \u2014 a stark, frozen moment of a patient\u2019s greatest vulnerability, the body positioned in a way nature and the photographer dictate, all except for the eyes. The eyes cannot be manipulated or coaxed. It is often said that the eyes are the windows to the soul. Maybe that is why black bars are printed over the eyes of the patient. Perhaps this is done to protect the patient\u2019s anonymity, but I wonder if it isn\u2019t really done to shield the peering eyes of the medical community from the humanity before them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In college, when Jill rushed a sorority, she couldn\u2019t keep up with fellow pledges as they walked across campus. When a man who had been following the group saw Jill lag behind, he crept up and exposed himself to her. \u201cI had been targeted because I was weak,\u201d Jill writes. \u201cI had assumed the plight of the injured gazelle, the one separated from the herd with a lame leg. \u2026 Any normal eighteen-year-old would bolt for safety, but I remained glued in place, the shame of my predicament filling every cell of my being. I was trapped alongside a simple street curb, something I couldn\u2019t climb, no matter my desperate need to get away.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But even more powerful in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/manufacturing-my-miracle-9781538197226/\">Manufacturing My Miracle</a>\u201d than the candid humiliations are the scenes of family, love and hope.</p>\n\n<p>Jill\u2019s wry humor comes through when she writes about dating. At one point she used a Match.com profile to come up with the estimate that at least 1% of men are open to dating a woman with a disability. In typical Jill fashion, rather than lamenting the other 99%, she was thrilled that this meant that if she got her profile in front of enough men, she could have a new date every week of the year.</p>\n\n<p>Jill eventually met Jeremy, the man she would marry. She writes about aspects of their relationship with such tenderness that I frequently paused after a passage just to sit and think about her words for a few moments. \u201cI recalled our first weeks of dating when Jeremy made a heartfelt observation,\u201d Jill writes. \u201cPreviously, as a single man, he often went an entire weekend without saying even one word aloud. It was such a contrast to the way I lived my life. I was known to strike up a conversation with the caller of a misdialed number, banter with strangers in a bookstore, or chat freely with the checkout clerk at the grocery store.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In their second month of dating, Jill and Jeremy attended the gigantic Iowa State Fair. Here\u2019s how Jill remembered it:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI lived ten years in a single night, clutching carnival booty tightly to my chest as Jeremy walked up and down the rows of carnival games, taking entirely too long to decide which to go for. \u2018What\u2019s taking you so long?\u2019 I asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m trying to find one you can play,\u2019 he said.</p>\n\n<p>My eyes filled with tears.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<p>After our \u201cThis American Life\u201d segment came out in 2016, Jill became a bit of a celebrity among people struggling to figure out their own mysterious illnesses.</p>\n\n<p>She developed into a sort of clearinghouse for people with undiagnosed muscle conditions seeking help. She kept in constant touch with a man in rural Pakistan who sent her a video of his struggle to rise from his knees following daily prayers at a local mosque. She navigated immense cultural and logistical barriers to help him get a genetic test. \u201cShe was a worldwide person,\u201d her mother, Mary, told me recently, \u201cjust out of her little office in Gowrie, Iowa.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Jill became so fluent in genetics that she was perceived as a scientist when she called labs, lab supply companies or pharmaceutical companies. Toward the end of her life, that fluency allowed her to obtain an experimental gene therapy that isn\u2019t actually available for nonresearch purposes. She knew the drug was both promising and potentially deadly, and with a loving husband and college student son in mind, she was hesitant. \u201cI no longer had a fear of death,\u201d Jill writes in <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/manufacturing-my-miracle-9781538197226/\">her book</a>, \u201cbut this did not imply that I wanted to die. My wish was the opposite, but without a life partner and a child, I wouldn\u2019t need to consider anyone\u2019s viewpoint but my own.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As always, she did consider others, and at the time of her death she had not gone through with this final experiment.</p>\n\n<p>In April, Jill and Jeremy drove to Chicago to attend a wedding. Mary shared photos with me, and it\u2019s the same Jill I began talking to in 2013: dressed impeccably, every strand of blond hair in its right place. She took great care and pride in her appearance. Looking at the pictures, it is extremely hard to imagine that Jill was less than two months away from dying.</p>\n\n<p>Her brother Aaron, afflicted with the same condition, had passed away in 2019. Four of the five siblings inherited the mutation, though the disease severity differed \u2014 likely moderated by other parts of the genome. In \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/manufacturing-my-miracle-9781538197226/\">Manufacturing My Miracle</a>,\u201d Jill writes of the difficult decision regarding whether or not to have a child, given the 50-50 chance of passing down her mutation. Her son, Martin, did not inherit the mutation.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly before the \u201cThis American Life\u201d episode ran, Jill got nervous and wondered if we should hit pause on it. She worried that listeners would only focus on her decision to have a child and criticize her for being selfish. We talked for hours about the potential outcomes. Jill and I had been in touch for three years by that time, and we were going to stick together as friends no matter what criticism came. She decided we should forge ahead. Fortunately, the response was the most overwhelmingly positive of any story I\u2019ve ever been involved with.</p>\n\n<p>Jill and I met up in Chicago after that so I could watch her give an invited lecture. We kept in touch over the years. Sometimes we went months without talking before a burst of calls back and forth.</p>\n\n<p>By this spring, it had been an unusually long while since we last talked. We emailed, but no phone calls. Mary told me that Jill had recently bought a new dress that she planned to wear when giving talks about <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/manufacturing-my-miracle-9781538197226/\">her book</a>. At a visitation before the funeral, she\u2019ll be wearing her book dress.</p>\n\n<p>Mary added that, a few weeks before Jill passed, she caught pneumonia and never recovered. Mary told me her voice was weak. \u201cI kept telling her to call you,\u201d Mary said. \u201cBut she kept saying: \u2018I want my voice to be stronger. I want my voice to be stronger before I call David.\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m crestfallen that I didn\u2019t hear from her again, but I think her voice was plenty strong.</p>",

The owner had purchased it in 2006 through a federal mortgage program designed specifically for people like her: impoverished, first-time homeowners who live in the most rural parts of the United States. The loan, which came directly from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, required no down payment. </p>\n\n<p>But things started going wrong from the day she moved in. First, the basement flooded. Then the furnace stopped working. As major repair costs accumulated over the next six years, the woman\u2019s health deteriorated until she was forced to leave her job as a manager at Kmart. Her disability check was not enough to cover medical expenses and the upkeep required for the house \u2014 let alone the $855 monthly mortgage. </p>\n\n<p>So in 2012 she drove to a USDA office 20 miles away and tried to give the house back. She said staff there would not accept her keys, telling her instead to call a toll-free number for help, as agency protocol requires. She left a message and did not hear back. She stopped paying her mortgage and moved out. </p>\n\n<p>Her dream home sat abandoned for more than a decade.    </p>\n\n<p>USDA guidance says the <a href=\"https://www.rd.usda.gov/media/file/download/hb-1-3550-consolidated.pdf\">agency should act quickly</a> when borrowers fall behind on payments \u201cto minimize any potential loss to the Government and to the borrower.\u201d A prompt sale keeps the government from having to pay the legal and administrative costs associated with foreclosure down the road and may protect the borrower from incurring a major blemish on their credit history.</p>\n\n<p>But that did not happen. Rather, 13 years passed before a sheriff\u2019s deputy knocked on the door of the woman\u2019s public housing apartment in May and served her with foreclosure papers on the now dilapidated ranch home that\u2019s been overtaken by squatters. The government\u2019s delay hurt the value of its investment and left the woman with a bill far greater than the cost of the loan she initially took out \u2014 with additional interest and other fees that had accumulated over those years.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The woman, now 68, declined to be interviewed, but her attorney, Tom Cox, said she allowed him to share her experience on the condition that she not be named to protect her privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Since March, the USDA has filed 56 foreclosures in the federal court system against properties purchased with a rural development mortgage, also known as a Section 502 direct loan. All but one were in Maine. The borrowers have been in default for an average of nearly nine years. </p>\n\n<p>As in the case of the Caribou homeowner, the USDA\u2019s delays in those cases have resulted in borrowers racking up more debt because of the interest and fees that piled up in the intervening years, according to a Bangor Daily News and ProPublica examination of the foreclosure cases and interviews with former USDA officials and legal experts. </p>\n\n<p>On average, borrowers in the 55 Maine cases owe $110,000 more than they would have had the agency moved to take possession of the properties when they first defaulted, the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica found. This includes what the USDA calls <a href=\"https://www.rd.usda.gov/media/file/download/maximum-property-preservation-allowances.pdf\">\u201cpreservation and inspection\u201d fees</a>, a broad category on the foreclosure filings that can include home repairs and yard maintenance, among other things.  </p>\n\n<p>Borrowers who can\u2019t pay risk having the government <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/17/2020-09447/debt-management#:~:text=If%20a%20USDA%20agency%20determines,in%20operations%20of%20USDA%20agencies\">garnish their wages or federal benefits</a> such as Social Security. The Caribou woman had her disability checks garnished six times since 2015 to offset her debt before the USDA even foreclosed on her property, according to her lawyer. The best way to keep the government from garnishing federal benefits is to file for bankruptcy, attorneys said.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt really undermines the concept of giving access to homeownership to a population who might not otherwise have been able to afford it,\u201d said Rhiannon Hampson, former USDA rural development director for Maine who stepped down in January before President Donald Trump was inaugurated. \u201cThe irony, with all of these fees piled on, is that they can\u2019t afford to get out of it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The recent wave of foreclosure filings in Maine underscores the government\u2019s failure to monitor a mortgage program that since its founding in 1949 has poured tens of billions of tax dollars into giving the poorest Americans a shot at homeownership.</p>\n\n<p>The USDA does not publicly report how often it files foreclosures. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Maine Democrat and member of a House appropriations subcommittee overseeing the USDA\u2019s direct loan program, has proposed language in the House agriculture appropriations report for the 2026 fiscal year calling on the agency to regularly report the number of foreclosures and abandoned properties related to the direct loan program. The bill awaits a vote before the full House of Representatives.</p>\n\n<p>The USDA regularly filed foreclosures in Maine prior to the coronavirus pandemic but has rarely done so in recent years, according to Richard H. Broderick Jr., a Maine attorney with whom the agency had contracted to file foreclosures until 2022. Kevin Crosman, the Maine attorney now filing foreclosures on behalf of the USDA, would not comment on why the agency started doing so again.</p>\n\n<p>Reporters visited 12 of the 55 homes in the Bangor Daily News\u2019 core coverage area in May. At least five appeared to be abandoned and in disrepair \u2014 with windows boarded up or a sign affixed to the door saying it was being cared for by a New York company \u2014 raising doubts that the government will recoup its investments. </p>\n\n<p>The USDA is supposed to take custody of properties purchased with a Section 502 direct loan and begin the foreclosure process when the homeowner becomes incapacitated, dies or has abandoned it, according to the agency\u2019s handbook. Otherwise the properties may languish and lose value.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        <p>It really undermines the concept of giving access to homeownership to a population who might not otherwise have been able to afford it.</p>\n\n    \n        \n        \u2014Rhiannon Hampson, former USDA rural development director for Maine\n\n    \n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Agency guidelines do not specify how soon the government should step in after a loan falls into delinquency, but under federal law, lenders cannot foreclose on a property until borrowers have been in default for 120 days.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly a fifth of the USDA\u2019s 159,208 Section 502 direct loans in its active national portfolio \u2014 30,496 \u2014 were delinquent as of March, according to internal agency data obtained by the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica. That rate is double what a 1993 internal agency report said was acceptable. But neither the USDA nor the White House would say why the agency is focusing on foreclosures in Maine. Vermont is the only other state in which the USDA has filed a single foreclosure, according to federal court filings.</p>\n\n<p>The foreclosures started just before Trump\u2019s Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/04/16/news/maine-attorney-general-pam-bondi-civil-rights-lawsuit-title-ix-maine-department-of-education-transgender-athletes/\">sued the state of Maine</a> in April over its inclusion of transgender athletes in girls\u2019 sports, part of a larger spat between Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills. The White House would not say whether the foreclosures are connected in any way to those ongoing conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration is seeking to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf\">eliminate the 76-year-old rural homeownership program</a> in the <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/resource/president-trump-releases-skinny-budget-request-foreshadowing-historic-cuts-hud-full-fy26\">White House\u2019s budget proposal</a> for the 2026 fiscal year. Some of his predecessors, including Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have also sought to cut back the $880 million direct mortgage program, which has bipartisan support in Congress.</p>\n\n<p>A USDA spokesperson said the Trump administration is in the process of reviewing the loans to \u201cunderstand the magnitude of the problems it has inherited.\u201d The agency noted that in Maine alone, more than 800 properties are considered delinquent and nearly 400 homes are being tracked for foreclosure. The USDA did not respond to additional questions.</p>\n\n\u201cHopelessly in Debt\u201d\n<p>In 2013, months after the Caribou woman had abandoned her property, she received a letter at her new residence from the USDA informing her that she had to pay the government $22,000 in missed mortgage payments and late fees or she\u2019d lose the Caribou home, said Cox, her lawyer. He said she did not pay because she did not want the house anymore. The USDA sent her nearly a dozen letters between 2014 and 2015 claiming foreclosure was imminent, but a decade passed before she was served with foreclosure papers this spring. </p>\n\n<p>A sign on the front door says the property is being maintained by a New York City company, which did not return calls seeking comment. A green tarp stretches across missing sections of the roof. Inside, piles of garbage and feces litter the floor.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n\n                            \n                                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n\n            The dilapidated state of the house a woman bought with a USDA mortgage in Caribou, Maine\n    \n            (Courtesy of Tom Cox)\n    \n    \n    \n\n            \n                    \n    \n                    \n<p>A real estate broker who inspected the home in June with Cox estimated the value of the house to be around $40,000, a steep depreciation from the 2006 purchase price of $144,000. </p>\n\n<p>During the time since she abandoned the property, what the woman owes USDA continued to balloon, Cox said. </p>\n\n<p>His client now owes the government $393,463, according to court documents \u2014 nearly 10 times what the home is worth. Nearly 60% of that comprises interest that accumulated after she defaulted, as well as $91,304 in \u201cpreservation and inspection\u201d fees. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf the USDA had dealt with this back in 2012, they might have gotten most or all of their money back by selling the home\u201d before it deteriorated, Cox said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to collect it now. It\u2019s a huge waste of government resources and money to let this happen.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Other USDA borrowers simply continue living in their homes long after they default on their loans, accumulating more debt with each passing year that the government does not move to collect.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        <p>It\u2019s a huge waste of government resources and money to let this happen.</p>\n\n    \n        \n        \u2014Attorney Tom Cox\n\n    \n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Christine Ogden had stopped paying the $465-a-month mortgage for her blue saltbox home in the coastal Maine town of Searsport in 2013, according to court documents. She said she told the USDA at the time to take her home after the agency threatened her with foreclosure if she did not pay.  </p>\n\n<p>But it took the government until 2019 to attempt to foreclose upon her property. The case was dismissed in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. Five years later, in April, she received a summons to appear in federal court to start foreclosure proceedings again.</p>\n\n<p>Ogden now owes $203,787 on what had been a $66,200 mortgage, according to court documents. Half of her debt comprises interest that accumulated after she defaulted, as well as other fees she would not have had to pay had the USDA addressed the delinquency sooner, an analysis by the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica found. </p>\n\n<p>Ogden, who has lived rent-free in the house for 12 years, says she is unable to pay the burgeoning debt and does not know what will happen. The foreclosure will hurt her credit, making it harder for her to get another loan or find rental housing, she said. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI'm 59,\u201d Ogden said. \u201cI\u2019ll be homeless, basically.\u201d </p>\n\nLittle Government Oversight\n<p>The owners of another property, in Norridgewock in central Maine, also stopped paying their mortgage \u2014 and moved out of the house \u2014 years before the USDA foreclosed on the home this spring, court records show. The owners have not appeared to live at the property since at least 2014, according to property tax records, and defaulted on their loan in 2019 \u2014 but the government did not file for foreclosure until April. </p>\n\n<p>The owners, it turned out, were violating USDA rules by renting out their home. The tenant, who answered the door when a reporter visited in May after the foreclosure was filed in federal court, would not share his name but estimated that he has paid $100,000 in rent to the owners during the 12 years he said he has lived there. USDA guidelines allow borrowers to rent their homes for up to three years, and only under very narrow circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Properties purchased under the 502 direct loan program are supposed to be the borrower\u2019s permanent residence and not meant to generate income, according to <a href=\"https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/single-family-housing-programs/single-family-housing-direct-home-loans-10\">USDA guidelines</a>. Homeowners can rent out their properties only due to certain life events such as if their families outgrow their current home or if they are moving for a job. But the borrower must still pay the mortgage every month.</p>\n\n<p>The USDA says the owners of the Norridgewock home owe the agency $276,191. The homeowners live in Tennessee, according to foreclosure summons and other court records filed this year by the USDA; they did not respond to calls made to phone numbers listed under their names.</p>\n\n<p>USDA staff based in Maine who once were in close touch with borrowers when they ran into financial trouble now have little to no oversight of Section 502 loans. That\u2019s because a major restructuring in the 1990s eliminated many of the county offices that had managed all aspects of the loans and centralized the servicing of these loans to an office in St. Louis, said Leslie Strauss, a senior policy analyst for the Housing Assistance Council, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit focused on affordable rural housing.</p>\n\n<p>These changes came on the heels of an internal study in 1991 concluding that centralizing the administration of these loans would result in better service and a lower delinquency rate of about 10%, according to a <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/rced-93-231br\">1993 report</a> by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. More than three decades later, the delinquency rate for Section 502 direct loans has nearly doubled to 19%. </p>\n\n<p>Hampson, Maine\u2019s former USDA rural development official who now leads economic development for the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, said she had been pushing the agency to allow local staff to regain oversight of borrowers\u2019 financial situations \u201cso that we can go out and monitor what\u2019s going on, so that we aren\u2019t caught by surprise.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But her effort did not gain traction, Hampson said. </p>\n\n<p>As the foreclosures accumulated in Maine in recent months, the USDA website <a href=\"https://www.rd.usda.gov/media/file/download/maine-sfh-pay-asst-memo-may-2025.pdf\">published an advisory</a> directing struggling Maine borrowers to call the St. Louis office for help. But fewer staff members are available to respond after Trump\u2019s recent cuts to the federal workforce.</p>\n\n<p>As of early May, 1,536 employees \u2014 nearly a third of the rural development office \u2014 had taken the buyout, according to USDA documents outlining the results of the Trump administration\u2019s two financial incentive offers to quit. Of those, 197 worked in the St. Louis office.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford failure,\u201d Hampson said of the long-delayed foreclosures leading to insurmountable debt. \u201cThe onus is on the government to make sure that we\u2019re providing the right kind of safety nets to prevent this sort of thing from happening.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.bangordailynews.com/author/mshepherd/\">Michael Shepherd</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bangordailynews.com/author/sray/\">Sasha Ray</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bangordailynews.com/author/pbrewer/\">Paula Brewer</a> of BDN contributed reporting. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/mariam-elba\">Mariam Elba</a> of ProPublica contributed research.</p>",

Adams, former officials said, was so close to the unit he had access to a little-known livestream of the CRT\u2019s body-worn camera footage, a detail that Donlon cited in his legal complaint.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What They Said:</strong> \u201cThe Community Response Team speaks to the culture under Adams of willfully violating the constitutional rights of civilians and officers,\u201d John Scola, Donlon\u2019s lawyer, told ProPublica. That culture is: \u201cWe\u2019ll do whatever we want.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> In 2023, a senior NYPD official wrote a scathing internal audit after finding that CRT officers were wrongfully stopping New Yorkers and failing to document the incidents. Weeks later, Adams took to Instagram to boost the unit. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CuQ1thnMJJy/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=a0de6eaf-c574-4c60-bb2b-cce35a41005b&amp;img_index=2\">Turning out with the team</a>,\u201d he wrote, showing a photo of him wearing a wide smile and khaki pants, CRT\u2019s official uniform.</p>\n\n<p>The official who wrote that audit was pushed out months later. He and other top former commanders recently sued Adams alleging favoritism and misconduct, charges the mayor denies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Donlon, a former FBI agent who held the job of police commissioner for only two months, from September to November 2024, lobbed his accusations against Adams as the mayor has been waging an uphill battle to keep his job. Adams was indicted last fall on federal charges of bribery, fraud and illegally taking campaign contributions from foreigners. He pleaded not guilty. He avoided trial by making a deal with President Donald Trump, who dropped the prosecution in exchange for Adams working with the administration on immigration enforcement. Still, he remains unpopular in the city and is running for reelection as an independent against a popular Democrat, Zohran Mamdani.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Response:</strong> In a statement, the mayor\u2019s office dismissed Donlon\u2019s claims.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese are baseless accusations from a disgruntled former employee who \u2014 when given the opportunity to lead the greatest police department in the world \u2014 proved himself to be ineffective,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis suit is nothing more than an attempt to seek compensation at the taxpayer\u2019s expense after Mr. Donlon was rightfully removed from the role of interim police commissioner.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Previously, Adam has defended the CRT. Asked about the unit at a press conference this spring, the mayor said, \u201cCRT is here.\u201d He continued, \u201cI support all my units.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The NYPD did not respond to requests for comment about the suit.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT Q&amp;A \u2014 </strong><em><em>President Donald Trump has offered a strong hand of support to Ukraine in recent days, pledging new weapons and threatening Russia with tariffs and sanctions if it does not end the war. It\u2019s a reversal from previous engagement with Moscow, which has failed to result in any substantial progress to peace.</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Cipher Brief spoke with former senior CIA officer and 6-time station chief Ralph Goff - who has traveled to Ukraine and the region multiple times since the Russian war in Ukraine began - about why he believes Putin has pushed too far this time and about how Europe sees the Russian threat beyond Ukraine. This interview - which you'll only find in The Cipher Brief - has been edited for length and clarity.</em></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong>You were in Lithuania during the NATO summit. What was your sense there about the threat that Russia really poses to Europe today?</em></p><p><em><strong><em>Goff: </em></strong></em>Unlike the United States, where most people probably followed the NATO summit tangentially, the summit was pretty much front and center in the news in Lithuania. The Baltic States, being frontline states, the NATO border with the Russian Federation, the people there, not just the politicians, but the people, the public, tend to follow these security issues such as NATO quite closely because they see the threat literally every day across the border.</p><p>It was interesting because the summit was pretty much a victory lap by President Trump. In his first administration, he pressured Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the others to increase their military spending. And he had some success there. But then of course, there was some backsliding in the intervening years. And now, once again, he's been pressuring our European allies to step up their defense spending, seeking this 5% commitment from the member states, which he by and large got. The summit was interesting because he got what he wanted.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong>Trump may be getting what he wants from NATO, but he's certainly not getting what he wants from Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 which is to bring about an end to the war in Ukraine. His frustration seems to be growing over the last few weeks as he's realized that Putin is not really making any significant progress toward a ceasefire deal.</em></p><p><em><strong><em>Goff: </em></strong></em>I think Putin has drastically overplayed his hand with President Trump. I think Putin, the old KGB case officer, was rather condescending to the president. I think he overestimated his skills as a case officer, where he thought he could manipulate and flatter the president into performing the way he wanted \u2014 and that didn't happen.</p><p>President Trump likes President Putin; they're both very transactional people. From President Vladimir Putin\u2019s side, all he had to do was behave himself. And he didn't. He had President Trump bludgeoning Kyiv into a position to accept some sort of peace negotiations. And the Ukrainians were in line. Meanwhile in Russia, they did nothing. Vladimir Putin, in fact, doubled down. In the last week, the air attacks on Ukraine have been unprecedented. Before, the norm was 30 to 40, maybe 80 drones at night attacking various Ukrainian cities. Now they're firing hundreds of them at night, along with scores of cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles, air-to-air missiles, the S-300s used in ground attack mode.</p><p>Putin has doubled down looking to break the Ukrainian will with his attacks, and it hasn't worked. The exact opposite has happened. Now he's got President Trump upset with him. President Trump feels that he\u2019s done everything he could to mollify Putin and kind of see things his way, and it hasn't worked. So now it's time to try something else. That had a lot to do with how he changed his mind on NATO as well.</p><p>When Putin invaded Ukraine, he gave them one one bloody gift: he gave them their national identity. After the attack, it was clear to Ukrainians they were Ukrainians. Their national identity was firm. And Donald Trump kind of did the same thing where he kind of turned his back on NATO. He expressed his skepticism, he kind of made them think that perhaps at some point the United States wouldn't not take a leading role in NATO and force the Europeans to grow up to suddenly not just talk about playing a more active role in NATO but actually do it as well. So now instead of just meetings where they issue polite statements, you have NATO where they're spending more money and they're rebuilding their defense industrial complex. So it's a big change, and I would say Vladimir Putin has no one to blame but himself.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em>Sign up today</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em>.</em></strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong>As of Monday, July 14,<strong> </strong>President Trump was giving Vladimir Putin another 50 days to come to an agreement to cease fire. From a non-expert perspective, I would think that the Russian President would use that 50 days to pound Ukraine even harder to try to create as much devastation as he can. How likely do you think that President Putin is going to change any part of his behavior in this 50-day window that President Trump has offered?</em></p><p><em><strong><em>Goff: </em></strong></em>One thing Vladimir Putin is very consistent about is that he does not respond to pressure. It takes a lot to get Putin to move and it's going to take a lot more than a 50 day deadline, right? President Trump has become very fond of deadlines such as the deadline imposed on Iran before striking them. I guess that's a tool that he sees some usefulness for.</p><p>But with Vladimir Putin, I don't really think deadlines are gonna have any impact. What will matter is the actions that come through. You've got a very robust set of sanctions that the Senate has prepared under the leadership of Senator Lindsey Graham. He says something like 84 senators are in support of what is supposedly a more robust package of sanctions than the White House had developed. So we'll see where that goes.</p><p>And then there\u2019s also getting the Europeans to crack down. Getting the Europeans not just to commit to spending more money, but to also commit to providing that aid immediately to the Ukrainians. Then there's things like getting Europe fully off of Russian oil. They're still buying oil and gas from Russia. Although they say by the end of 2027, I think they're supposed to be off of it. And in the meantime, things like cracking down on the so-called shadow fleet that the Russians have. There's a lot that can be done there to stem the flow of oil out of Russia and the money that goes back in for that oil.</p><p>And then things like when you see provocations in the Baltic Sea \u2014 sabotage of underwater internet cables or other type of infrastructure between the Nordic states and the Baltics \u2014 that there\u2019s a response. Maybe we're seeing a hint of that with what triggered some remarks from Russia, where the Estonians did a test firing of their HIMARS batteries out to sea. It shows that they can cover a good chunk of the Baltic Sea from the shores of Estonia. So, there's a lot that the NATO countries and the United States can do to put pressure on Putin within that 50-day window. The trick is not to wait until the end of it, but to start ratcheting out now.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

You've got sizable Russian minorities in the Baltic regions. For instance, Estonia is a country of about 1.4 million people and they have about 300,000 Russians, the bulk of whom live in one area kind of in the northeast, the town of Narva. One could see a situation where little green men show up in Narva to protect the Russian population from some sort of perceived Estonian nationalists. Then you know what we're looking at is not just the Crimea where russia successfully annexed a part of the Ukraine, but an incursion into a NATO country which is protected under Article Five. I would say any kind of information operations against Estonia and the other Baltic countries, Latvia and Lithuania, any kind of increased sabotage activity, gray zone activity in the Baltics, that would be signs that maybe there's worse to come. So we really have to be vigilant there.</p><p><em><strong><em>Are you Subscribed to </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> on YouTube?

Kennedy Jr. wants to overhaul an obscure but vital program that underpins the nation\u2019s childhood immunization system.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on what he does, the results could be catastrophic.</p>\n\n<p>In his crosshairs is the <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation\">Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a>, a system designed to provide fair and quick payouts for people who suffer rare but serious side effects from shots \u2014 without having to prove that drugmakers were negligent. Congress created the program in the 1980s when lawsuits drove vaccine makers from the market. A special tax on immunizations funds the awards, and manufacturers benefit from legal protections that make it harder to win big-money verdicts against them in civil courts.</p>\n\n<p>Kennedy, who founded an anti-vaccination group and previously accused the pharmaceutical industry of inflicting \u201cunnecessary and risky vaccines\u201d on children for profits, has long argued that the program removes any incentive for the industry to make safe products.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://tuckercarlson.com/tucker-show-rfk-jr-2025\">interview with Tucker Carlson</a>, Kennedy condemned what he called corruption in the program and said he had assigned a team to overhaul it and expand who could seek compensation. He didn\u2019t detail his plans but did repeat the long-debunked claim that vaccines cause autism and suggested, without citing any evidence, that shots could also be responsible for a litany of chronic ailments, from diabetes to narcolepsy.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of ways he could blow up the program and prompt vaccine makers to stop selling shots in the U.S., like they did in the 1980s. The trust fund that pays awards, for instance, could run out of money if the government made it easy for Kennedy\u2019s laundry list of common health problems to qualify for payments from the fund.</p>\n\n<p>Or he could pick away at the program one shot at a time. Right now, immunizations routinely <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/covered-vaccines\">recommended for children or pregnant women</a> are covered by the program. Kennedy has the power to drop vaccines from the list, a move that would open up their manufacturers to the kinds of lawsuits that made them flee years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Eddy Bresnitz, who served as New Jersey\u2019s state epidemiologist and then spent a dozen years as a vaccine executive at Merck, is among those worried.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf his unstated goal is to basically destroy the vaccine industry, that could do it,\u201d said Bresnitz, who retired from Merck and has consulted for vaccine manufacturers. \u201cI still believe, having worked in the industry, that they care about protecting American health, but they are also for-profit companies with shareholders, and anything that detracts from the bottom line that can be avoided, they will avoid.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for <a href=\"https://phrma.org/\">PhRMA</a>, a U.S. trade group for pharmaceutical companies, told ProPublica in a written statement that upending the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program \u201cwould threaten continued patient access to FDA approved vaccines.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The spokesperson, Andrew Powaleny, said the program \u201chas compensated thousands of claims while helping ensure the continued availability of a safe and effective vaccine supply. It remains a vital safeguard for public health and importantly doesn\u2019t shield manufacturers from liability.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Since its inception, the compensation fund has <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vicp/vicp-stats-06-01-25.pdf\">paid about $4.8 billion</a> in awards for harm from serious side effects, such as life-threatening allergic reactions and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an autoimmune condition that can cause paralysis. The federal agency that oversees the program found that for every 1 million doses of vaccine distributed between 2006 and 2023, about <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vicp/vicp-stats-06-01-25.pdf\">one person was compensated</a> for an injury.</p>\n\n<p>Since becoming Health and Human Services secretary, Kennedy has turned the staid world of immunizations on its ear. He reneged on the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/health/kennedy-vaccines-gavi.html\">U.S. government\u2019s pledge</a> to fund vaccinations for the world\u2019s poorest kids. He fired every member of the federal advisory group that recommends which shots Americans get, and his new slate vowed to scrutinize the U.S. childhood immunization schedule. Measles, a vaccine-preventable disease eliminated here in 2000, roared back and hit a grim record \u2014 more cases than the U.S. has seen in 33 years, including three deaths. When a U.S. senator asked Kennedy if he recommended measles shots, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO7eteLb178\">Kennedy answered</a>, \u201cSenator, if I advised you to swim in a lake that I knew there to be alligators in, wouldn\u2019t you want me to tell you there were alligators in it?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Fed up, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical societies sued Kennedy last week, <a href=\"https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/FiledSuit.pdf\">accusing him of dismantling</a> \u201cthe longstanding, Congressionally-authorized, science- and evidence-based vaccine infrastructure that has prevented the deaths of untold millions of Americans.\u201d (The federal government has yet to respond to the suit.)</p>\n\n<p>Just about all drugs have side effects. What\u2019s unusual about vaccines is that they\u2019re given to healthy people \u2014 even newborns on their first day of life. And many shots protect not just the individuals receiving them but also the broader community by making it harder for deadly scourges to spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that routine childhood immunizations have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm?s\">prevented more than 1.1 million deaths</a> and 32 million hospitalizations among the generation of Americans born between 1994 and 2023.</p>\n\n<p>To most people, the nation\u2019s vaccine system feels like a solid, reliable fact of life, doling out shots to children like clockwork. But in reality it is surprisingly fragile.</p>\n\n<p>There are only a handful of companies that make nearly all of the shots children receive. Only one manufacturer makes chickenpox vaccines. And just two or three make the shots that protect against more than a dozen diseases, including polio and measles. If any were to drop out, the country could find itself in the same crisis that led President Ronald Reagan to sign the law creating the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in 1986.</p>\n\n<p>Back then, pharmaceutical companies faced hundreds of lawsuits alleging that the vaccine protecting kids from whooping cough, diphtheria and tetanus caused unrelenting seizures that led to severe disabilities. (Today\u2019s version of this shot is different.) One vaccine maker after another <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/12/us/maker-of-vaccine-quits-the-market.html\">left the U.S. market</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At one point, pediatricians could only buy whooping cough vaccines from a single company. Shortages were so bad that the CDC recommended doctors <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000452.htm\">stop giving booster shots</a> to preserve supplies for the most vulnerable babies.</p>\n\n<p>While Congress debated what to do, public health clinics\u2019 cost per dose jumped 5,000% in five years.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe were really concerned that we would lose all vaccines, and we would get major resurgences of vaccine-preventable diseases,\u201d recalled Dr. Walter Orenstein, a vaccine expert who worked in the CDC\u2019s immunization division at the time.</p>\n\n<p>A Forbes headline captured the anxiety of parents, pediatricians and public health workers: \u201cScared Shotless.\u201d So a bipartisan group in Congress hammered out the no-fault system.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the program covers vaccines routinely <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/covered-vaccines\">recommended for children or pregnant women</a> once Congress approves the special tax that funds awards. (COVID-19 shots are part of a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46982#:~:text=HRSA%20reports%20that%20as%20of,eligible%20for%20compensation%20(1.6%25).\">separate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/health/covid-vaccines-side-effects.html\">often-maligned</a> system for handling claims of harm, though Kennedy has said he\u2019s looking at ways to add them to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.)</p>\n\n<p>Under program rules, people who say they are harmed by covered vaccines can\u2019t head straight to civil court to sue manufacturers. First, they have to go through the no-fault system. The law established a <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vicp/vaccine-injury-table-01-03-2022.pdf\">table of injuries</a> and the time frame for when those conditions must have appeared in order to be considered for quicker payouts. A tax on those vaccines \u2014 now 75 cents for every disease that a shot protects against \u2014 flows into a trust fund that pays those approved for awards. Win or lose, the program, for the most part, pays attorney fees and forbids lawyers from taking a cut of the money paid to the injured.</p>\n\n<p>The law set up a dedicated vaccine court where government officials known as special masters, who operate like judges, rule on cases without juries. People can ask for compensation for health problems not listed on the injury table, and they don\u2019t have to prove that the vaccine maker was negligent or failed to warn them about the medical condition they wound up with. At the same time, they can\u2019t claim punitive damages, which drive up payouts in civil courts, and pain and suffering payments are capped at $250,000.</p>\n\n<p>Plaintiffs who aren\u2019t satisfied with the outcome or whose cases drag on too long can exit the program and file their cases in traditional civil courts. There they can pursue punitive damages, contingency-fee agreements with lawyers and the usual evidence gathering that plaintiffs use to hold companies accountable for wrongdoing.</p>\n\n<p>But a Supreme Court ruling, interpreting the law that created the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, limited the kinds of claims that can prevail in civil court. So while the program isn\u2019t a full liability shield for vaccine makers, its very existence significantly narrows the cases trial lawyers can file.</p>\n\n<p>Kennedy has been involved in such civil litigation. In his federal disclosures, he revealed that he referred plaintiffs to a law firm filing cases against Merck over its HPV shot in exchange for a 10% cut of the fees if they win. After a heated exchange with Sen. Elizabeth Warren during his confirmation proceedings, Kennedy said his share of any money from those cases would instead go to one of his adult sons, who he later said is a lawyer in California. His son Conor works as an attorney at the Los Angeles law firm benefiting from his referrals. When ProPublica asked about this arrangement, Conor Kennedy wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t work on those cases and I\u2019m not receiving any money from them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In March, a North Carolina federal judge overseeing hundreds of cases that alleged Merck failed to warn patients about serious side effects from its HPV vaccine <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-prevails-gardasil-safety-litigation-2025-03-11/\">ruled in favor of Merck</a>; an appeal is pending.</p>\n\n<p>The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program succeeded in stabilizing the business of childhood vaccines, with many more shots developed and approved in the decades since it was established. But even ardent supporters acknowledge there are problems. The program\u2019s staff levels haven\u2019t kept up with the caseload. The law capped the number of special masters at eight, and congressional bills to increase that have failed. An influx of adult claims swamped the system after adverse reactions to flu shots became eligible for compensation in 2005 and serious shoulder problems were added to the injury table in 2017.</p>\n\n<p>The quick and smooth system of payouts originally envisioned has evolved into a more adversarial one with lawyers for the Department of Justice duking it out with plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, which Kennedy says runs counter to the program\u2019s intent. Many cases drag on for years.</p>\n\n<p>In his recent interview with Carlson, he described \u201cthe lawyers of the Department of Justice, the leaders of it\u201d working on the cases as corrupt. \u201cThey saw their job as protecting the trust fund rather than taking care of people who made this national sacrifice, and we\u2019re going to change all that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve brought in a team this week that is starting to work on that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The system is \u201csupposed to be generous and fast and gives a tie to the runner,\u201d he told Carlson. \u201cIn other words, if there\u2019s doubts about, you know, whether somebody\u2019s injury came from a vaccine or not, you\u2019re going to assume they got it and compensate them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Kennedy didn\u2019t identify who is on the team reviewing the program. At one point in the interview, he said, \u201cWe just brought a guy in this week who\u2019s going to be revolutionizing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The HHS employee directory now lists Andrew Downing as a counselor working in Kennedy\u2019s office. Downing for many years has filed claims with the program and suits in civil courts on behalf of clients alleging harm from shots. Last month, HHS awarded a <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75P00125P00036_7570_-NONE-_-NONE-\">contract for \u201cVaccine Injury Compensation Program expertise\u201d</a> to <a href=\"https://bss.law/team-member/drew-downing/\">Downing\u2019s firm</a>, as <a href=\"https://www.notus.org/health-science/hhs-award-vaccine-injury-compensation-program\">NOTUS has reported</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Downing did not respond to a voicemail left at his law office. HHS didn\u2019t reply to a request to make him and Kennedy available for an interview and declined to answer detailed questions about its plans for the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. In the past, an HHS spokesperson has said that Kennedy is \u201cnot anti-vaccine \u2014 he is pro-safety.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>While it\u2019s not clear what changes Downing and Kennedy have in mind, Kennedy\u2019s interview with Carlson offered some insights. Kennedy said he was working to expand the program\u2019s three-year statute of limitations so that more people can be compensated. <a href=\"https://www.standinguptopots.org/potscast/e171-post-gardasil-pots-litigation-with-attorney-drew-downing/\">Downing has complained</a> that patients who have certain autoimmune disorders don\u2019t realize their ailments were caused by a vaccine until it\u2019s too late to file. Congress would have to change the law to allow this, experts said.</p>\n\n<p>A key issue is whether Kennedy will try to add new ailments to the list of injuries that qualify for quicker awards.</p>\n\n<p>In the Carlson interview, Kennedy dismissed the many studies and scientific consensus that shots don\u2019t cause autism as nothing more than statistical trickery. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do real science,\u201d Kennedy said.</p>\n\n<p>The vaccine court spent years in the 2000s trying cases that alleged autism was caused by the vaccine ingredient thimerosal and the shot that protects people from measles, mumps and rubella. Facing more than 5,000 claims, the court asked a committee of attorneys representing children with autism to pick test cases that represented themes common in the broader group. In the cases that went to trial, the special masters considered more than 900 medical articles and heard testimony from dozens of experts. In each of those cases, the <a href=\"https://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism-decisions-and-background-information\">special masters found</a> that the shots didn\u2019t cause autism.</p>\n\n<p>In at least two subsequent cases, children with autism were granted compensation because they met the criteria listed in the program\u2019s injury table, according to a vaccine court decision. That table, for instance, lists certain forms of encephalopathy \u2014 a type of brain dysfunction \u2014 as a rare side effect of shots that protect people from whooping cough, measles, mumps and rubella. In a 2016 vaccine court ruling, Special Master George L. Hastings Jr. explained, \u201cThe compensation of these two cases, thus does not afford any support to the notion that vaccinations can contribute to the causation of autism.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Hastings noted that when Congress set up the injury table, the lawmakers acknowledged that people would get compensated for \u201csome injuries that were not, in fact, truly vaccine-caused.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Many disabling neurological disorders in children become apparent around the time kids get their shots. Figuring out whether the timing was coincidental or an indication that the vaccines caused the problem has been a huge challenge.</p>\n\n<p>Devastating seizures in young children were the impetus for the compensation program. But in the mid-1990s, after a yearslong review of the evidence, HHS <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1995-02-08/html/95-2945.htm#:~:text=SUMMARY:%20This%20final%20rule%20amends,is%20effective%20March%2010%2C%201995.\">removed seizure disorder from the injury table</a> and narrowed the type of encephalopathy that would automatically qualify for compensation. Scientists subsequently have discovered genetic mutations that cause some of the most severe forms of epilepsy.</p>\n\n<p>What\u2019s different now, though, is that Kennedy, as HHS secretary, has the power to add autism or other disorders to that injury table. Experts say he\u2019d have to go through the federal government\u2019s cumbersome rulemaking process to do so. He could also lean on federal employees to green-light more claims.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Kennedy has made it clear he\u2019s thinking about illnesses beyond autism. \u201cWe have now this epidemic of immune dysregulation in our country, and there\u2019s no way to rule out vaccines as one of the key culprits,\u201d he told Carlson. Kennedy mentioned diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, seizure disorders, ADHD, speech delay, language delay, tics, Tourette syndrome, narcolepsy, peanut allergies and eczema.</p>\n\n<p>President Donald Trump\u2019s budget estimated that the value of the investments in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program trust fund could reach $4.8 billion this year. While that\u2019s a lot of money, a life-care plan for a child with severe autism can cost tens of millions of dollars, and the CDC reported in April that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/ss/ss7402a1.htm\">1 in 31 children</a> is diagnosed with autism by their 8th birthday. The other illnesses Kennedy mentioned also affect a wide swath of the U.S. population.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Paul Offit, a co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, for years has sparred with Kennedy over vaccines. Offit fears that Kennedy will use flawed studies to justify adding autism and other common medical problems to the injury table, no matter how much they conflict with robust scientific research.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can do that, and you will bankrupt the program,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are ways to end vaccine manufacturing in this country.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>If the trust fund were to run out of money, Congress would have to act, said Dorit Reiss, a law professor at University of California Law San Francisco who has studied the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Congress could increase the excise tax on vaccines, she said, or pass a law limiting what\u2019s on the injury table. Or Congress could abolish the program, and the vaccine makers would find themselves back in the situation they faced in the 1980s.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not unrealistic,\u201d Reiss said.</p>\n\n<p>Rep. Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, last year proposed the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9828#:~:text=Summary%20of%20H.R.9828%20-%20118th%20Congress\">End the Vaccine Carveout Act</a>, which would have allowed people to bypass the no-fault system and head straight to civil court. His press release for the bill \u2014 written in September, before Kennedy\u2019s ascension to HHS secretary \u2014 <a href=\"https://gosar.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=8582\">quoted Kennedy</a> saying, \u201cIf we want safe and effective vaccines, we need to end the liability shield.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The legislation never came up for a vote. A spokesperson for the congressman said he expects to introduce it again \u201cin the very near future.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ren\u00e9e Gentry, director of the George Washington University Law School\u2019s Vaccine Injury Litigation Clinic, thinks it\u2019s unlikely Congress will blow up the no-fault program. But Gentry, who represents people filing claims for injuries, said it\u2019s hard to predict what Congress, faced with a doomsday scenario, would do.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNormally Democrats are friends of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers,\u201d she said. \u201cBut talking about vaccines on the Hill is like walking on a razor blade that\u2019s on fire.\u201d</p>",

One FDA inspector saw a worker put on a sterile gown and then brush up against a waste bin and use their hands to push down the overflowing trash. Investigators also saw liquid dripping through ceiling cracks and the growth of what appeared to be fungus and mold in a storage area for samples used for testing.</p>\n\n<p>The FDA in late 2022 had banned the factory in the city of Halol from shipping drugs to the United States because of similar manufacturing failures.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/fda-drug-loophole-sun-pharma\">ProPublica reported last month</a> that a low-profile group inside the agency at the same time exempted some medications from that ban, ostensibly to prevent drug shortages. The FDA has granted similar exemptions for drugs made at more than 20 other foreign factories that violated critical standards in drugmaking and were barred from the U.S. market.</p>\n\n<p>The FDA kept the practice largely hidden from the public. The agency did not regularly test drugs coming from the banned factories or proactively monitor reports about potential harm among consumers, ProPublica found.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In Sun\u2019s case, more than a dozen drugs were initially excluded from the Halol import ban. The company is still allowed to send five to the United States, <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_189.html\">government records show</a>, including vecuronium bromide, a muscle relaxer used during surgery, and the cancer drug doxorubicin. Also excluded are divalproex delayed release tablets, which treat seizures and other conditions; leuprolide injection, used by people with prostate cancer, endometriosis and other conditions; and temozolomide capsules, for brain cancer.</p>\n\n<p>The inspection last month marked the first time the FDA had been back to the factory in the 2.5 years since it imposed the import ban and Sun started sending exempted drugs to the United States. Inspectors found that procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of sterile drugs were not established or followed and that equipment wasn\u2019t maintained to prevent malfunctions that would \u201calter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the drug product,\u201d according to the report. </p>\n\n<p>Some of the concerns focused on the exempted drugs still being sent to the United States, according to a person familiar with the situation who did not want to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The FDA <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25998843-sun-pharma-2025-483/#document/p15/a2664414\">blacked out the names of the drugs</a> that were potentially compromised on its publicly released inspection report, including a medication made on a manufacturing line in which several batches had to be rejected because they were filled with black particles.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            A portion of the FDA\u2019s June inspection report redacted the names of potentially compromised drugs manufactured by Sun that continue to be released to the U.S. market.\n    \n            (Obtained by ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see issues continue to come up at this site given the site\u2019s role in potentially manufacturing critical drugs for U.S. consumers,\u201d said the person familiar with the inspection findings. </p>\n\n<p>Sun did not respond to questions about the latest inspection or its regulatory history with the FDA. In an email, the company said that adherence to quality standards \u201cis a top priority for Sun, and we maintain a relentless focus on quality and compliance to ensure the uninterrupted supply of medicines to our customers and patients worldwide. We continue to work proactively with the US FDA and remain committed to achieve full resolution of any FDA regulatory issues at our facilities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The FDA said factories that receive exemptions from import bans are required to conduct extra testing on drugs with third-party oversight before they are sent to the United States, helping to ensure patient safety. Sun\u2019s Halol plant, however, was cited in 2022 and again last month for failing to thoroughly investigate unexplained quality problems, including impurities, found during drug testing. The FDA did not respond to a request for comment about the latest Sun inspection. </p>\n\n<p>U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Michigan, who recently <a href=\"https://debbiedingell.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5712\">co-sponsored a bill</a> to lower prescription drug costs, said in a statement to ProPublica that the FDA has a responsibility to ensure that drugs coming into the country are safe.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe need full transparency about the extent to which exemptions enabled sub-par, unsafe, or ineffective drugs to be distributed to American patients,\u201d she said.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Medill Investigative Lab student Katherine Dailey contributed reporting.</p>",

Trump also issued an ultimatum of additional U.S. sanctions if Russian President Vladimir Putin fails to end his attacks and agree to a ceasefire within 50 days \u2013 as of Monday.</p><p>Amid the barrage of Russian attacks, experts note that the commitment of additional Patriot systems will allow Ukraine to defend itself but won\u2019t do much to move the needle toward ending the war, unless Putin flinches at the threat of sanctions, which he has not done. \u201cUkraine was given just enough support not to lose against Russia under President Joe Biden, but never enough support to actually win and end this war,\u201d writes former Chief of CIA\u2019s Central Eurasia Division Rob Dannenberg in a piece exclusive to <em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/trump-winning-president-ukraine\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> </em>this week. Meanwhile, there are signs that President Trump\u2019s patience is wearing thin.</p><p>The White House responded yesterday to the readout of a July 4 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that signaled the president\u2019s interest in Ukraine\u2019s ability to launch <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b66f03b5-e295-4f8c-92ba-516a527d588c\" target=\"_blank\">deep strikes</a> on Russian territory. Sources familiar with the call said Trump asked Zelensky, \u201cVolodymyr, can you hit Moscow? Can you hit St. Petersburg, too?\u201d Zelensky reportedly replied, \u201cAbsolutely. We can, if you give us the weapons.\u201d</p><p>While the administration downplayed the report, saying President Trump \u201cwas merely asking a question, not encouraging further killing,\u201d a White House spokesperson said Trump also said Zelensky \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-zelenskiy-should-not-target-moscow-2025-07-15/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shouldn\u2019t target Moscow</a>\u201d. In the meantime, Kyiv has been incredibly innovative in working with what it has available, to strike at the heart of Russian aggression.</p><p>On June 1, in a military strike that stunned analysts worldwide, Ukraine launched a bold drone operation\u2014dubbed <em>Spider\u2019s Web</em>\u2014that struck four Russian air bases <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/graphics/UKRAINE-CRISIS/DRONES-RUSSIA/mypmjzayyvr/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">up to</a> 3,000 miles from Kyiv, reportedly destroying or damaging a dozen nuclear-capable bombers. Satellite imagery suggests that among the damaged aircraft were Tu-95s and Tu-22s, long-range bombers used to launch cruise missiles at Ukraine.</p><p>The drones\u2014simple quadcopters costing less than $1,000\u2014were reportedly guided through Russia\u2019s own 4G <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2025/06/ukrainian-attack-on-russian-bombers-shows-how-cheap-drones-could-upset-global-security/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">networks</a> and possibly using AI to avoid detection and strike with precision. While Moscow denied any significant damage and threatened retaliation, Western analysts saw something more significant: a clear sign that modern warfare is entering a new era. Small, inexpensive drones can now slip past advanced air defenses, giving countries like Ukraine a way to challenge far larger militaries.</p><p>However, the implications go far beyond Ukraine and Russia. The operation sent a clear message to militaries worldwide: Ukraine can strike deep into enemy territory with precision and surprise\u2014and others could, too.</p><p>\u201cIt suggests a new angle of surprise attack that our defenses need to adjust to,\u201d Kori Schake, director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt\u2019ll be very difficult to calibrate warning against small drone attacks. You can bet militaries are scrambling to figure it out.\u201d</p><p><strong>Moment of Reckoning</strong></p><p>While Russia\u2019s immediate damage was a significant setback, the true shockwave from Ukraine\u2019s <em>Spider\u2019s Web</em> operation spread far beyond the battlefield.</p><p>Military experts worldwide recognized this attack as a clear warning\u2014exposing new vulnerabilities and signaling a shift in how modern warfare will be fought.</p><p>U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/04/ukraine-attacks-us-dangers-aircraft-00385666\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">referred</a> to it as a \u201cwake-up moment,\u201d noting the sheer magnitude of destruction and the ease with which it was executed. As U.S. aircraft continue to sit exposed on runways across the Pacific and homeland, the risk of similar strikes has become more than theoretical.</p><p>Nolan Peterson, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and former Air Force Special Operations pilot, concurs that the operation was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the Pentagon and \u201cshowed how drones are now a bridge between conventional and unconventional combat, having democratized long-range, precision strike capabilities that were once exclusive to conventional state militaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the hands of conventional and unconventional operators, drones can have tactical, operational, and strategic effects \u2014 from precision strikes on the battlefield to disabling power stations and oil refineries, shutting down airports, or destroying nuclear-capable bombers sitting on the tarmac at an air base,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd, even if they are armed with relatively weak munitions, small drones now offer America\u2019s adversaries a low-cost, plausibly deniable way to spread panic and paralyze our economy.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

Coordination between federal agencies is sluggish, legal authorities are fragmented, and training at the base level hasn't kept pace with the growing threat, something U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth promises to change with a new plan to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJxD-Bjqk3w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">modernize DoD\u2019s use of drones</a>.</p><p>But beyond the technical vulnerabilities, the strategic implications of the June 1 strike are far-reaching. A new reality is emerging\u2014one in which commercial drones launched from anywhere near a military site, concealed in barns, trucks, or civilian buildings, can carry out devastating attacks once reserved for high-end missiles. As military drone technology becomes more autonomous and lethal, the urgency to adapt grows by the day.</p><p>\u201cMilitaries can\u2019t just rely on missiles and stealth jets anymore,\u201d said Nolan Peterson, former Air Force Special Operations pilot. \u201cDrones now serve as the bridge between conventional and unconventional warfare, granting near-peer capabilities to smaller actors.\u201d</p><p>Peterson warned that even relatively weak munitions, when paired with drone agility and scale, can paralyze economies, take down power grids, or disable key strategic aircraft\u2014often without attribution.</p><p>\u201cThis is the democratization of strategic strike,\u201d he said.</p><p>The United States, he added, must recognize that air superiority now hinges not only on dominance in the skies\u2014but in the so-called <em>air littoral</em>, the low-altitude zone where small drones thrive.</p><p>\u201cWe need a layered defense that combines traditional systems with new tech specifically designed to track and eliminate small UAVs, including both kinetic interceptors and directed energy weapons,\u201d Peterson said.</p><p><strong>In the future</strong></p><p>The June 1 drone strikes marked a turning point in global stability, exposing how small, low-cost drones can now threaten even the nuclear assets of major powers\u2014something once only possible for other nuclear states.</p><p>Traditional doctrines designed to prevent nuclear escalation were never built to handle strikes from smaller, non-nuclear actors like Ukraine or to anticipate the risk posed by non-state groups potentially launching false-flag operations to provoke conflict. As drones become cheaper and more accessible, their disruptive power demands urgent attention\u2014in ethical debates around AI autonomy and regulatory efforts to prevent misuse.</p><p>So, what can be done?</p><p>Justin Bronk, Senior Research Fellow for Airpower and Technology in the Military Sciences team at the Royal United Services Institute, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em> that the United States and most other NATO air forces should \u201curgently invest in reconditioning old Hardened Aircraft Shelters and building new ones since aircraft stored in such shelters when not in use are essentially invulnerable to small UAV attacks and are also much safer against a host of other potential threats than when out in the open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardened Aircraft Shelters are not difficult or high-risk technologies; their utility is clear against the threat, and Russia has already started building new ones at multiple fighter bases to defend against Ukrainian strikes,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cSecondarily, air forces need to both invest in soft-kill anti-UAV defenses such as jammers but recognize that the main defense against such attacks by infiltration teams with large numbers of explosive-equipped UAVs has to be the intelligence and security services.\u201d</p><p>Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research and the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, points out that now that the mode of the \u201csurprise\u201d attack is known, \u201cit is conceivable that people will start taking appropriate defensive measures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLight nets over aircraft, for example, jamming mobile networks, these kinds of things,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, it will add complexity and cost to operations, and no defense is perfect, but a reasonable defense is not impossible.\u201d</p><p>Some analysts also warn that governments <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2025/06/ukrainian-attack-on-russian-bombers-shows-how-cheap-drones-could-upset-global-security/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">may need</a> to treat small drones more like firearms, implementing tighter export controls and purchase restrictions, even if doing so would impede the booming commercial drone market. The attack also raises questions about artificial intelligence and its role on a drone-dominated battlefield in the future.</p><p>\u201cAI in weapons systems is nothing new, but the off-the-shelf and cheap implementation of AI is revolutionary,\u201d Retired Special Forces Colonel Jason Amerine tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cBillion-dollar weapons programs look silly in the face of Ukraine\u2019s ingenuity. The lesson I take away is the constant reminder that we can do things much more cheaply and elegantly with significant cost savings.\u201d</p><p>He also observed that while the U.S. military has developed a \u201crobust short-range air defense capability,\u201d it still lacks \u201can extensive and inexpensive counter-drone system\u201d that can be deployed at scale.</p><p>\u201cLegacy platforms like the aging Avenger can be upgraded to help plug some of the gaps,\u201d Amerine continued. \u201cBut the long-term solution lies in funding experimental laser weapons and spectrum dominance systems. With enough investment, lasers and jamming tech could provide a cost-effective way to neutralize small drones before they strike.\u201d</p><p>Peterson, however, contends that it was the \u201cskills of Ukraine\u2019s drone operators that made the operation a success \u2014 along with tradecraft, covert logistics, and a host of other operational achievements that had nothing to do with technology.\u201d</p><p>In any case, <em>Operation Spider\u2019s Web</em> marked a critical moment in modern warfare, revealing how low-cost, commercially available drones can deliver devastating blows to even the most fortified military assets.</p><p>The assault exposed how vulnerable even the most advanced militaries are to cheap, small, and easily concealed weapons. Dozens of AI-enabled drones were launched from within Russian territory, damaging or destroying a significant number of nuclear-capable bombers. These aircraft had been central to Russia\u2019s ability to fire long-range, hard-to-intercept cruise missiles\u2014now, that capability is diminished.</p><p>Rather than high-end equipment, the attack relied on ingenuity, autonomy, and scale-transforming commercial-grade drones into strategic weapons.</p><p>\u201cAbove all, America\u2019s military leaders need to understand that you cannot have air superiority, supremacy, or dominance without also controlling the so-called air littoral \u2014 the low altitude airspace at which small drones operate,\u201d Peterson explained. \u201cWe need a layered approach, pairing traditional air defense systems with new technologies purpose-built to detect and destroy small drones. And this included both kinetic and directed energy systems.\u201d</p><p>Yet Schake is \u201cnot convinced yet that it revolutionizes warfare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt signals that small, cheap, disposable drones are a genuine threat to expensive, exquisite platforms,\u201d she added. \u201cIt makes restoring mobility on the battlefield a real challenge, and it imposes cost-exchange ratios unfavorable to expensive platforms, but it\u2019s not a substitute for taking and holding territory.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

    "title": "CIA's Latest Existential Challenge",
    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/cia-s-latest-existential-challenge",
    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION --</strong> Today, the Central Intelligence Agency faces a crisis of trust. While CIA officers have long confronted adversaries abroad, the Agency now finds itself navigating an increasingly politicized relationship with the American public it serves.</p><p>A dangerous perception has taken root in recent years, namely that the CIA, intended to be apolitical by design, has become a partisan actor in our polarized national politics. If left unaddressed, this perception threatens not only the Agency\u2019s effectiveness but, by extension, the country\u2019s broader national security. Reflecting on my 34-year career in intelligence and nearly a decade beyond it, I recognize that such existential challenges, though rare, are not unprecedented. And there are ways to recover.</p><p>In the more than four decades since I first took the oath of office as a new CIA operations officer, I cannot recall a time when CIA was not confronted with daunting challenges. From the Cold War through the 1990\u2019s when we dealt with what then-Director James Woolsey called \u201ca jungle full of a number of poisonous snakes,\u201d to the post-9/11 war against jihadi terror and the reappearance of peer competitors, there was never a time when the Agency was not called upon to provide crucial intelligence on, and sometimes to directly confront, our nation\u2019s adversaries. I imagine those serving today face similarly formidable tasks: from countering China\u2019s rise, dealing with Russian irredentism and Iranian-inspired terrorism, to integrating <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/to-counter-china-reform-u-s-intelligence-for-the-digital-age\" target=\"_self\">cutting-edge AI</a> across the breadth of Agency operations, and rebuilding the service\u2019s human intelligence arm after the severe damage wrought by the \u2018reorganization\u2019 of 2015.</p><p>I can, however, recall only a few times when the Agency\u2019s existence was existentially challenged. The Church Committee and \u2018Time of Troubles\u2019 of the mid-1970\u2019s, were before my time. But I served during the interregnum of the 1990\u2019s, when some misguided souls thought we had reached the end of history and that, with the demise of the \u2018Evil Empire,\u2019 the nation no longer needed an intelligence service. I was also there in the post-9/11 era when the Agency was assigned disproportionate blame for that murderous assault on our nation. The professionalism and effectiveness of CIA officers in carrying out the Agency\u2019s mission were ultimately proof against those efforts to dismantle the organization.</p><p>Today, as I look at CIA from afar, it seems to me yet again to be under existential threat because many of the citizens the Agency serves have come to see it as an adversary. In truth, there has always been a particular tension in the juxtaposition between the secret world in which Agency officers live and the values of the democracy they serve. Even Presidents have sometimes voiced discomfort with the nature of the CIA\u2019s mission. President Harry S. Truman judged that \u201csecrecy and a free, democratic government don\u2019t mix.\u201d John F. Kennedy thought that \u201cthe very word secrecy\u2019 is repugnant in a free and open society.\u201d Those views are reflective of the uneasiness of the American people with the secret world and with actions seen or portrayed as less than honorable that are undertaken in their name. Former CIA Director Richard Helms addressed this inherent friction between secrecy and democracy when he wrote that \u201cthe nation must take it to a degree on faith that we, too, are honorable men dedicated to their service.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>What national security news are you missing today? Get full access to your own national security daily brief by upgrading to<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\"> Subscriber+Member</a> status.</strong> </em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>There were rare moments when the Agency enjoyed popularity. I will never forget watching the cheering crowd in front of the White House hailing CIA and the U.S. military in the wake of our delivery of justice to Osama Bin Laden. But, for the most part, the American people seemed in accord with the reluctant toleration of the Agency\u2019s activities expressed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower when he pronounced intelligence \u201ca distasteful but vital necessity.\u201d They seemingly understood that CIA has an incredibly difficult job, and that, consequently, its officers must \u2013 as John le Carre wrote in <em>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</em> \u2013 sometimes \u201cdo disagreeable things so that ordinary people here and elsewhere can sleep safely in their beds at night.\u201d</p><p>Public opinion surveys show confidence in the CIA has experienced fluctuations over time, marked by periods of erosion and recovery. Such shifting views of CIA are understandable given its role. An assertion by the Agency\u2019s first Director, Allen Dulles, that an issue under discussion in his time was \u201ca policy matter and not my job\u2019 notwithstanding, CIA has often found itself at the center of policy debates.</p><p>I can recall seemingly innumerable instances over the course of my career when the Agency, invariably hindered by its secret nature in defending itself, was used as a political football in all too often internecine arguments.</p><p>Of late, however, public confidence in the CIA has eroded significantly compared to previous decades. While most Americans still view the Agency as vital to national security, there are persistent and growing concerns about civil liberties, partisanship, and transparency.</p><p>Partisan polarization is a particular concern as trust in the CIA is increasingly shaped by political affiliation. Support among Democrats grew during the Biden administration, while Republican support declined. Moreover, Americans are more likely to judge the CIA\u2019s performance based on their alignment with the sitting president. Given the dictates of our democratic system, that perception of <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/402464/government-agency-ratings-cia-fbi-federal-reserve-down.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">political bias</a> portends serious problems not only for CIA\u2019s mission-effectiveness, but potentially for its very existence, if not addressed. </p><p>In order to do so, it is necessary to ask how that perception took hold. How did CIA which, by definition, must be an apolitical organization, come to be tarred with a partisan brush? Some will see it is a natural outgrowth of the deep divisions that characterize our nation\u2019s politics today. There is, sadly, a lot of truth in this. However, it must also be admitted that the actions of some who have an abiding love for the organization they serve, or served in, helped widen those rifts. They include, in the first instance, any CIA officers who, in the wake of the 2016 Presidential election, violated the law and their oaths to the Constitution by joining in what could only be described as a tsunami of leaks of classified or politically sensitive information as part of an attempt to \u2018resist\u2019 a President elected to office by a majority of American voters. </p><p>Further, one need only listen to half the country to understand that those serving and former officers who explicitly or implicitly cited their CIA affiliation \u2013 thereby implicitly indicating access to information unknown to the average citizen - in support of political causes contributed greatly to that perception of partisanship. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Subscriber+Members have exclusive access to the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">Open Source Collection Daily Brief</a>, keeping you up to date on global events impacting national security. It pays to be a <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\">Subscriber+Member</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Specific instances of this include lending support to the legitimacy of the since conclusively discredited \u201cSteele Dossier\u201d and, particularly, signing the open letter characterizing the \u2018Hunter Biden laptop\u2019 as having the hallmarks of a Russian information operation. Whatever personal views individual officers might hold on these and other politically contentious issues, there can be no doubt that many of our countrymen \u2013 not to mention many senior government officials - view the public statements of former CIA officers as the Agency putting its thumb on the political scale.</p><p>The organization has made clear this is not the case. But, as Henry Kissinger said, \u201cit is not a matter of what is true that counts, but a matter of what is perceived to be true.\u201d The question now is what CIA and Agency officers, past and present, can do to change that perception. A few steps come to mind.</p><p>First, CIA needs to reinforce its efforts to identify leakers and bring them to justice. As the Snowden case demonstrated, given the nature of modern technology and the speed with which information can be propagated, there is no difference in terms of the negative impact of their actions on U.S. national security between those who leak information and those spying for a foreign power. </p><p>Second, the time when former Director William J. Casey\u2019s expressed desire for a \u201cno-profile agency\u201d having long passed, CIA should re-double its public outreach efforts. Such programs will not, of course, quash the many conspiracy theories out there ranging from the serious (i.e., that CIA somehow had a hand in the JFK assassination) to the ridiculous (e.g., disproving the presence of the remains of space aliens being stored in the basement of the Original Headquarters Building). But the judicious release of historical information and the like does help educate the American people on what the Agency does in their name. </p><p>Finally, the Agency should remind former officers that they have life-long secrecy obligations but also reinforce the message that they remain representatives of CIA even after leaving the service in the eyes of their countrymen who, for the most part, do not distinguish between past and present Agency officers. Consequently, invoking their Agency experience in support of any endeavor that is clearly politically partisan can only damage the organization they served and make the already difficult jobs of those still serving harder still. And those are consequences to which no one who had the privilege and honor of serving at CIA wants to contribute.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><em>All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the US Government.

    "link": "https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-floods-oral-histories",
    "description": "<p class=\"byline\">\n                by <a class=\"name\" href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/logan-jaffe\">Logan Jaffe</a>                </p>\n                                          \n  \n\n\n\n                    \n<p>In late September 2000, longtime Kerr County, Texas, resident W. Thornton Secor Jr. sat down with an oral historian to <a href=\"https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth636788/\">tell his story</a>. Like many of the residents recorded as part of a decadeslong effort by the Kerr County Historical Commission to document the community\u2019s history, Secor had a lot to say about the area\u2019s floods. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt always seems to happen at night too,\u201d Secor said of local floods he and his family had experienced. \u201cCan\u2019t see most of it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Secor, who died in 2022, was a third-generation manager of a lodge that still operates along the Guadalupe River. His oral history shares family memories of floods going back to 1932 \u2014 like the time a flood that year washed away most of the cabins his grandfather built. </p>\n\n<p>Now, Secor\u2019s daughter, Mandi Secor Lipscomb, is left considering the future of the lodge in the aftermath of another devastating flood, on July 4. Secor Lipscomb is the fourth-generation owner and operator of the same lodge, <a href=\"https://www.waltonialodges.com/\">Waltonia on the River</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Often when I try to understand a place or process a big news event, I look for records kept by local historical societies and libraries. In archived documents, preserved photographs and oral history collections, one can start to see how a community understands itself. So, as news reports about the floods in the Central Texas Hill Country poured in throughout the week, I went looking for historical context. What local knowledge is held by people who live, or have lived, in what\u2019s repeatedly described as \u201cFlash Flood Alley\u201d? How have people in Kerr County\u2019s past contended with floods of their own time? </p>\n\n<p>A trove of more than 70 oral histories <a href=\"https://www.co.kerr.tx.us/historical/oralhistories.html\">recorded by the Kerr County Historical Commission</a> begins to answer those questions. The recordings document memories of floods going back to 1900, but oral histories alone rarely tell a full or accurate story. Still, there\u2019s at least one conclusion to draw: Everything has a history. The flood that killed more than 100 people in the Kerr County area this month <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/central-texas-hill-country-flooding-history/\">is not the first time</a> a flash flood on the Guadalupe River took lives of people, including children.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            The front page of a local newspaper, the Kerrville Daily Times, on July 20, 1987. A flash flood killed 10 campers as they tried to evacuate.\n    \n            (Kerrville Daily Times via Newspapers.com)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>I keep this history in mind when I hear local and state officials say no one could have seen this coming. Take <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLsbgiaSrg5/\">this exchange</a> between a reporter and Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reporter:</strong> Why weren\u2019t these camps evacuated?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> I can\u2019t answer that. I don\u2019t know.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reporter:</strong> Well you\u2019re the judge. I mean you\u2019re the top official here in this county. Why can\u2019t you answer that? There are kids missing. These camps were in harm\u2019s way. We knew this flood was coming.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> We didn\u2019t know this flood was coming. Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming. We have floods all the time. This is the most dangerous river valley in the United States. And we deal with floods on a regular basis. When it rains, we get water. We had no reason to believe that this was gonna be anything like what\u2019s happened here. None whatsoever. </p>\n\n<p>My colleague Jennifer Berry Hawes wrote last week about the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-flooding-evacuations-hurricane-helene\">uncanny similarities</a> between the Texas floods and Hurricane Helene, which struck North Carolina last year. In both disasters, weather forecasts predicted the potential devastation, yet people were left in harm\u2019s way.  </p>\n\n<p>And as another colleague, ProPublica editor Abrahm Lustgarten, pointed out in a piece about how <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-flash-flood-camp-mystic-climate-change-trump-noaa-fema\">climate change is making disasters like the flood in Texas more common</a>, \u201cthere will be tireless \u2014 and warranted \u2014 analysis of who is to blame for this heart-wrenching loss\u201d in the weeks to come.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShould Kerr County, where most of the deaths occurred, have installed warning sirens along that stretch of the waterway, and why were children allowed to sleep in an area prone to high-velocity flash flooding?\u201d Lustgarten wrote. \u201cWhy were urgent updates apparently only conveyed by cellphone and online in a rural area with limited connectivity?\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>As we wait for answers \u2014 or as journalists dig for them \u2014 the oral histories show Kerr County residents have warned one another, as well as newcomers and out-of-towners, about flooding for a long time. In his 2000 oral history, Secor said he remembered a time in the spring of 1959 when his father tried to warn one new-to-town woman about building a house so close to the river. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe took her out and showed her the watermarks on the trees in front of our house and all,\u201d Secor said, likely referring to the watermarks from the flood of 1932, which a local newspaper described at the time as \u201cthe most disastrous flood that ever swept the upper Guadalupe Valley.\u201d The flood killed at least <a href=\"https://climatexas.tamu.edu/products/severe-weather-summaries/1930s-texas-severe-weather\">seven people</a>. </p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 she says, \u2018that will never happen again,\u2019\u201d Secor recalled. </p>\n\n<p>He said her body was found in a tree a few months later after a flood swept her and the roof she stood on away. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to surprise newcomers when we get another flood like the \u201932 flood,\u201d Secor said in 2000.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get us again someday.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>As the Guadalupe River rose over the July 4 weekend, the 16-cabin lodge his daughter owns was sold out and full of guests. All of them escaped the floods, said Secor Lipscomb. They ran, some barefoot in the mud, up a steep hill beyond the property\u2019s retaining wall. They took shelter in a barn. </p>\n\n<p>Later, Secor Lipscomb assessed the damage to her family property. What she saw left her in tears: Four cabins had water up to the ceiling. Another two had flooded about 5 feet. But among the wreckage was a crew of nearly 40 volunteers, ready to help with the cleanup.</p>\n\n<p>By the time I reached out to her to ask her about her father\u2019s oral history, six cabins and the main camp office were already demolished. </p>\n\n<p>The cabin her great-grandfather and grandfather built together more than 100 years ago still stood. But it won\u2019t for much longer. It is so damaged with water that it, too, will have to go. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is our family history, our family legacy,\u201d Secor Lipscomb told me. \u201cOf course we\u2019re going to rebuild.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When they do, their customers will be ready. Many of the families who survived the flood already told her they\u2019ll be first in line to book for the next available July 4.</p>\n        \n                       \n                \n            Correction\n            <p><strong>July 21, 2025:</strong> This story originally misstated the death toll in the Kerr County area. The flood killed more than 100 people there, not more than 130.</p>",

This was an \u201cunattended\u201d death: one where no doctor could attest to a medical reason for the person\u2019s demise. That made it the coroner\u2019s job to determine how and why she died.</p>\n\n<p>Strong, a stocky man with white hair and bushy eyebrows, explained that he and his wife lived in an RV park on the edge of the woods nearby. He said his wife had been bedridden for years with Parkinson\u2019s disease. That morning she\u2019d woken up and asked for peanut butter and water, Strong told the deputy. He found her dead some time later.</p>\n\n<p>The coroner looked over Betty Strong\u2019s body. It was thin and frail. He didn\u2019t see a reason to suspect anything other than a natural death for this 75-year-old woman. The sheriff\u2019s deputy seemed to be satisfied with the explanation too. So, the coroner ruled that Betty Strong died around 8:40 a.m. on Dec. 14, 2016, from complications of Parkinson\u2019s, and he signed off on allowing cremation of her body.</p>\n\n<p>Less than five years later, Clayton Strong\u2019s next wife turned up dead, too: shot in the chest in Texas.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that both marriages had a history of domestic unrest, with visits from police who documented threats to each woman\u2019s safety.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s impossible to know whether a different approach to investigating Betty Strong\u2019s death would have uncovered foul play. What is certain is that clues and evidence in the case were lost forever \u2014 and Idaho\u2019s system for death investigation let it happen.</p>\n\n<p>Family members of both women believe a more thorough investigation of the death in Idaho might have saved the life of Clayton Strong\u2019s next wife in Texas.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSomeone shows up with a dead body and just says they died of natural causes,\u201d said Amy Belanger, one of Betty Strong\u2019s children. \u201cI mean, really, do you just take their word for it?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The answer is no, according to five of six national death investigation experts ProPublica consulted. They said the coroner should have obtained medical records to confirm Betty Strong was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s, examined the trailer where her husband said she died, or both.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can think of all sorts of scenarios \u2014 criminal, accidental or natural \u2014 that could have occurred there,\u201d said Jennifer Snippen, a death investigator, educator and consultant in Oregon. \u201cBut my argument is, if you don\u2019t go to the scene and you don\u2019t look at the medical records, you just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Most of the county coroners in Idaho are part-time elected officials with tiny budgets and no oversight or state funding to support their work. The national experts said that kind of system is more prone to cursory investigations like the one into Betty Strong\u2019s death.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/idaho-coroner-law-failed-reform\">failure to reform death investigations in Idaho</a> has <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/idaho-coroner-reform-timeline\">raised alarms for more than 70 years</a>, according to current and former Idaho coroners and previous ProPublica reporting.</p>\n\n<p>A national magazine called Idaho \u201cthe best place in the nation for a criminal to \u2018get away with murder\u2019 in the literal sense\u201d because of the state\u2019s \u201cantiquated county coroner\u2019s system,\u201d the Idaho Statesman newspaper reported in 1951.</p>\n\n<p>Asked whether murderers have escaped prosecution in Idaho\u2019s coroner system, Rich Riffle, coroner for the county that includes Boise, said, \u201cMy humble opinion? Yes.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>That almost happened in 2019 when one inexperienced Idaho coroner decided to take the word of Chad Daybell that his wife, Tammy Daybell, had died in her sleep after chronic health problems, vomiting and a cough. Her body was later exhumed after his next wife\u2019s children went missing. An autopsy by the Utah medical examiner\u2019s office found what medical records would have shown, had the Idaho coroner requested them: Tammy Daybell was healthy. A jury convicted Chad Daybell of murdering her by asphyxiation and of killing his next wife\u2019s two youngest children. The case is under appeal.</p>\n\n<p>At trial, coroner Brenda Dye said she had regrets. Her voice shaking, Dye told the court she would have ordered an autopsy if she\u2019d known better, but \u201cat that time, with my limited training and being new, I did the best I could.\u201d She declined ProPublica\u2019s interview request, citing <a href=\"https://www.ksl.com/article/50799068/idaho-coroner-discusses-case-thats-still-giving-her-nightmares-and-why-1st-year-was-worst-ever\">the case\u2019s effect on her mental health</a>.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            The community set up a memorial to two children who Chad Daybell was convicted of murdering; he was also convicted of killing his previous wife Tammy. The coroner originally believed Chad Daybell when he said that Tammy had died in her sleep.\n    \n            (John Roark/Post Register via AP)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Idaho isn\u2019t the only place where death investigations fall short. Because there is no uniform federal system, the rigor with which your death is investigated depends on where you die. Other states lack enough forensic pathologists to do autopsies. And many local systems like Idaho County\u2019s are squeezed for money.</p>\n\n<p>But even among its short-staffed, underfunded peers, Idaho stands out. One measure is the state\u2019s autopsy rate: third-lowest for autopsies in all deaths, last in the nation for autopsies in known cases of homicide.</p>\n\n<p>Gov. Brad Little said in January that he would support more state resources to help Idaho\u2019s coroners do their jobs. But he never got the chance; coroner-related bills passed by the Idaho Legislature this year contained no funding or other assistance for coroners and death investigations.</p>\n\n<p>So for now, each of Idaho\u2019s 44 coroners will bear costs that other states help cover: driving a body hundreds of miles to an autopsy; paying for some of those autopsies; or trying to recruit one more person to join Idaho\u2019s statewide forensic pathology workforce of three.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t care enough about how death investigations are done in your jurisdiction to invest in the people doing it, to provide them with the resources or to have high enough standards for the people that you hire to do this, you\u2019re going to get what you get, what you accept,\u201d said Snippen. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get what you allow to happen.\u201d</p>\n\nFlorida, 2010-2015\n<p>Betty Brock was a mother of seven who enjoyed singing and art, long bicycle rides, organizing family photos and researching her ancestry.</p>\n\n<p>She was caring for her terminally ill husband in 2010 when Clayton Strong befriended her on the internet, according to Belanger, her daughter. Strong claimed to be \u201cbasically destitute and living in his car,\u201d a backstory that appealed to a woman with a soft spot for taking in \u201cwounded people\u201d and trying to heal them with love, Belanger said.</p>\n\n<p>Strong drove hundreds of miles from Southwest Florida and showed up at the Brocks\u2019 property in the Florida panhandle. They agreed he could sleep in his car there as long as he helped with caregiving and housework. Soon he was sleeping in an outbuilding on the property, then in the house.</p>\n\n<p>Betty\u2019s children were puzzled as this newcomer became a fixture in their mother\u2019s life. They wanted to give Strong a chance, but they soon grew suspicious.</p>\n\n<p>Betty Brock\u2019s husband died in August 2010. By January, she was Betty Strong.</p>\n\n<p>After their courthouse marriage, Clayton Strong used their now-shared funds to buy a Ford truck and an Airstream trailer and took his bride on the road, Belanger said. The couple visited national parks that Betty had always wanted to see. They camped and hiked their way across the continent. They bought mining claims and panned for gold in the remote Idaho wilderness.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Betty and Clayton Strong. Betty\u2019s children say Clayton isolated her, threatened them when they tried to visit her, kept her from seeing her doctor, then took her to Idaho, where she died.\n    \n            (Courtesy of Amy Belanger)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>After that honeymoon, the walls around Betty Strong grew impenetrable, her children said. According to what two of her children told ProPublica and to statements two others made to police, Clayton became the gatekeeper of all communication with their mother, and he padlocked the doors of their Florida home and held the key.</p>\n\n<p>The last time Betty Strong saw her primary care doctor in Florida was in May 2013, according to records her son obtained after the death. Before that, she hadn\u2019t been in since 2010, the year Clayton Strong entered her life. The notes from the 2013 checkup show health issues common in older adults but no Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis, and neither Parkinson\u2019s nor other neurodegenerative diseases were listed in the family history section.</p>\n\n<p>The children watched from afar as the marriage devolved over the next two years. Between January 2014 and February 2015, police went to the couple\u2019s residence for welfare checks and domestic disturbances at least six times, according to police reports that Belanger provided to ProPublica. </p>\n\n<p>Her children told police that Clayton Strong threatened to shoot them if they set foot on the property, threatened to hurt their mother if they didn\u2019t back off, and prevented her from seeing a doctor.</p>\n\n<p>In the first of those police visits, in January 2014, the records show that Belanger\u2019s sister, who lived nearby, called the sheriff while standing outside the Strong residence, a brown house surrounded by oak trees and pines on a winding country road. A deputy arrived to find Belanger\u2019s sister and Clayton Strong in a stalemate, then talked to everyone outside, according to a sheriff\u2019s office report. The deputy then watched as Betty Strong turned to her husband to \u201cask him for permission\u201d to hug her daughter, and Clayton Strong \u201cremoved a set of keys from his pocket and unlocked the porch entrance gate so Betty could go in the yard\u201d for the hug.</p>\n\n<p>The report says the deputy made a referral to Florida Department of Children and Families, the agency that investigates possible abuse of vulnerable adults, and that the department opened a case.</p>\n\n<p>A similar scene played out when one of Betty Strong\u2019s sons went to the house to check on her in February 2015. For two years, Clayton Strong turned the son away when he tried to visit, and this time Strong \u201cthreatened to shoot him with a gun if he did not leave,\u201d the son told a sheriff\u2019s deputy. Clayton Strong denied that, the deputy\u2019s report says.</p>\n\n<p>The deputy found Betty Strong alone on a bed in an RV parked behind the home, the report says. She said she had Parkinson\u2019s disease and couldn\u2019t get around well. Clayton wasn\u2019t holding her against her will, she told the deputy, but she couldn\u2019t take care of herself without him.</p>\n\n<p>She had a walkie-talkie. The deputy asked: Is Clayton using that radio and telling you what to say? Betty answered \u201cno\u201d while nodding her head \u201cyes.\u201d It was a chilly afternoon, and the deputy noticed Betty had a blanket but no heater. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cBetty\u2019s demeanor, living conditions, and the controlling behavior by Clayton\u201d warranted a referral to the Florida Department of Children and Families, the deputy wrote.</p>\n\n<p>Asked for the outcome of that referral, a spokesperson told ProPublica the department investigates \u201call allegations of abuse, neglect, or exploitation\u201d but that records of those investigations are confidential under state law.</p>\n\n<p>Days after the referral in February 2015, police were again dispatched to the Florida home. This time, it wasn\u2019t one of Betty Strong\u2019s children who called; it was someone from adult protective services in need of police backup. According to the dispatch log, the worker said Clayton Strong \u201chas threatened before to pull a gun on her and is very anti-law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The couple left town a month later. Betty Strong\u2019s children never heard from her again.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Betty Strong early in her relationship with Clayton Strong. Within a few years of this trip, Clayton told authorities she\u2019d died of Parkinson\u2019s, but her children say she never had the disease.\n    \n            (Courtesy of Amy Belanger)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \nIdaho, December 2016\n<p>By the time Betty Strong died in Idaho County in December 2016, she hadn\u2019t been seen in Florida in 21 months.</p>\n\n<p>Idaho County\u2019s elected coroner, Cody Funke, had been in the job about as long.</p>\n\n<p>He knew the county well. Its vast forests, mountains and meadows stretch across more land than Massachusetts. Rugged and remote, it attracts people who want to be left alone and who distrust both government and conventional medicine. </p>\n\n<p>Funke, pronounced \u201cfunk,\u201d was in his late 20s in 2014 when he learned his part-time job at a funeral home was being eliminated. His boss asked: Had he considered running for coroner? The coroner at the time was retiring and urged Funke to do it. So did Funke\u2019s boss from his other part-time job, as an EMT. What sealed the deal for Funke: As coroner, he would get health insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Funke started the job with a feeling of \u201cgood luck, godspeed, you\u2019re gonna need it.\u201d There was no apprenticeship or ride-along to watch seasoned pros, like he\u2019d gotten when he trained to be an EMT. There was a training conference he attended in Las Vegas before taking office, and Funke received more than double the 24 hours of coroner education required by Idaho law. Even so, he isn\u2019t sure it was enough to prepare him. </p>\n\n<p>Funke learned on his first day that he wasn\u2019t getting a vehicle to move bodies from a death scene. If the local funeral home\u2019s vehicle was occupied, Funke had to use his family truck. A year after Betty Strong\u2019s death, the county commission got the coroner a vehicle: a pickup truck the sheriff\u2019s office didn\u2019t need anymore.</p>\n\n<p>The office he inherited also had no camera, and the county hadn\u2019t budgeted to give him one. He\u2019d have to use his phone to take pictures of bodies and death scenes.</p>\n\n<p>There was no morgue.</p>\n\n<p>The Idaho County coroner\u2019s office didn\u2019t even have an actual office.</p>\n\n<p>Funke\u2019s predecessors kept their files on paper, at home, he learned. The previous coroner\u2019s house had flooded, so when Funke took over, all that remained fit in two manila folders.</p>\n\n<p>The coroner\u2019s entire budget this year is $85,651. By comparison, coroner\u2019s offices serving small populations had an average budget of $280,000 in 2018, according to a national study.</p>\n\n<p>Paid $13,000 a year, Funke is on call 24 hours a day and, last year, investigated and ruled on 71 deaths, about one every five days. Papers on an additional 102 deaths of people under a doctor\u2019s care came through needing his signature for cremation.</p>\n\n<p>Funke does the coroner work on top of a full-time job. When a call comes in during business hours, he dips out to go to a death scene. If someone dies at dinnertime, he might not see his family until morning.</p>\n\n<p>He must decide with each death what the circumstances require: a simple phone call; an all-out investigation with autopsy, witness interviews, tissue samples and more; or something in the middle.</p>\n\n<p>To examine a death scene, Funke might have to drive three hours or longer each way. Whenever he orders an autopsy, Funke or his deputies have to take the body to the nearest autopsy center, a trip that takes a full day and usually demands an overnight stay. His current budget can cover 10 autopsies a year.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Cody Funke, the Idaho County coroner, also worked full time as a city wastewater treatment operator. He now works for the state prison system while remaining the coroner.\n    \n            (Liesbeth Powers for ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In those first years as coroner, Funke often leaned on police.</p>\n\n<p>Funke found it strange that Clayton Strong had loaded his wife\u2019s body into their SUV and driven to the hospital. Most people call 911 to report a death and wait for help to arrive, Funke said. But Strong offered an explanation that seemed to satisfy the sheriff\u2019s deputy: He didn\u2019t know many people in town and wasn\u2019t sure what to do.</p>\n\n<p>Strong had said his wife hadn\u2019t seen a doctor because she stuck to homeopathic remedies. That\u2019s not unusual for Funke to hear. </p>\n\n<p>The widower gave Funke the impression a coroner and sheriff\u2019s deputy wouldn\u2019t be welcome inside the trailer where she died. That\u2019s not so outside the norm for Idaho County either, Funke said.</p>\n\n<p>Betty Strong\u2019s death looked like an easy call. So Funke helped move her body to a cot to be taken from the hospital to a local funeral home.</p>\n\n<p>According to a later report from the sheriff\u2019s office, Clayton Strong showed up at the funeral home that day, said he wanted her cremated and paid $2,310 in cash. The way Funke heard it from a funeral home employee a few days later, Strong paid in $100 bills out of a lunch box.</p>\n\n<p>The detail struck Funke as peculiar. But he let it go.</p>\n\nFlorida, 2017\n<p>The couple\u2019s Airstream trailer showed up one day in January 2017, parked outside their house in Florida. A neighbor called Amy Belanger with the news, and she dispatched her brother, Daniel, who lived nearby. They\u2019d spent almost two years fearing the worst.</p>\n\n<p>The only person at the house was Clayton Strong.</p>\n\n<p>The family\u2019s matriarch had died a few weeks ago in Harpster, Idaho, Strong said. Then he told his son-in-law to get off the property.</p>\n\n<p>Amy Belanger started making calls the next day. One of the first people she reached was Funke, the county coroner. She was perplexed, she said. Why hadn\u2019t anyone called her or her siblings? Why didn\u2019t he question whether Betty Strong had actually succumbed to a disease or if something else had killed her? Belanger told Funke about the history of police calls in Florida and concerns about their mother\u2019s safety.</p>\n\n<p>Funke thought back to what he\u2019d heard from the funeral home. A lunch box of cash for a cremation? That image never sat quite right. Now he had solid ground for suspicion. Funke told Belanger he\u2019d talk to the county prosecutor and see what could be done. </p>\n\n<p>The prosecutor and the sheriff\u2019s office initially told Belanger they had opened a homicide investigation, according to a detailed timeline she created at the time. But the death scene \u2014 the Strongs\u2019 trailer \u2014 was long gone, the body cremated. The sheriff\u2019s investigator and prosecutor ultimately didn\u2019t seem to think there was enough evidence for a homicide investigation, Funke told ProPublica. </p>\n\n<p>(The prosecutor and sheriff\u2019s investigator did not return phone calls, emails or certified letters from ProPublica requesting comment on their decisions following Betty Strong\u2019s death.)</p>\n\n<p>Notes from Belanger\u2019s timeline quote a Florida detective saying he was sorry the death had occurred outside his jurisdiction. He explained to her that \u201cin Florida, deputies would have had the medical examiner\u2019s office verify medical records and take a blood sample.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The year Betty Strong died, 20% of natural deaths investigated by a medical examiner in the part of Florida where she had lived underwent autopsies before the examiner decided the cause of death was natural. About 65% of all deaths taken in by Florida\u2019s medical examiner that year were autopsied. Both numbers dwarf Idaho\u2019s coroner autopsy rates.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just Florida. Many states have more sophisticated systems for investigating deaths than Idaho\u2019s. In much of the country, centralized state medical examiner offices oversee all death investigations or provide a backstop to elected coroners in each county. </p>\n\n<p>Idaho\u2019s rural neighbor Montana has a hybrid system of medical examiners and coroners, supported by a <a href=\"https://nij.ojp.gov/program/national-center-forensics/creating-coroner-liaison-position\">coroner liaison</a> who works with death investigators to make the process more consistent statewide. And next door in Wyoming, a state board sets <a href=\"https://post.wyo.gov/board-of-coroners/post-coroner-rules\">rules for coroners to follow</a>. The rules spell out what each death investigation should include: scene investigation, toxicology sample, DNA sample, photographs, external examination of the body and an inventory of property, evidence and medications.</p>\n\n<p>Jennifer Snippen, the death investigator in Oregon, was one of the experts who drafted the National Institute of Justice\u2019s 2024 death-scene investigation guidebook.</p>\n\n<p>She said death investigations are more likely to be thorough when states and counties give their investigators enough funding and education, \u201cso that they have the motivation and the ability to get to as many scenes, and get as much information about every single death, as possible.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Those who study the work of coroners and medical examiners in the U.S. have learned that the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/gone-without-a-case-suspicious-elder-deaths-rarely-investigated\">deaths of elderly people are especially likely to be written off as age-related</a>, without considering whether the person may have also been a victim of abuse or neglect.</p>\n\n<p>Snippen\u2019s <a href=\"https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/m900p302v\">research in 2023</a> is one of the most recent studies to confirm that. She reviewed data from thousands of cases. The person least likely to get a scene investigation or autopsy? An elderly woman who dies at home.</p>\n\n<p>Lauri McGivern, a nationally recognized expert in death investigations, said national standards would have Funke verify Betty Strong\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis and ask more questions of Clayton Strong as the sole caregiver of a vulnerable adult. McGivern, who coordinates medicolegal death investigations in Vermont, reviewed the facts that Funke was given at the time of Betty Strong\u2019s death and his subsequent report at ProPublica\u2019s request.</p>\n\n<p>To follow national standards, McGivern said, Funke also would have gone to the Airstream trailer or asked law enforcement to examine the death scene and report back to him.</p>\n\n<p>But McGivern and other experts said they understand why Funke didn\u2019t follow those national guidelines \u2014 because they\u2019ve seen it happen so many times in places like rural Idaho.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing what he was shown how to do,\u201d McGivern said. \u201cAnd probably doing the best he can, with no budget and no support and no education.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            When Funke took over from Idaho County\u2019s previous coroner in 2015, there was no equipment. Over the years, Funke had to get county commissioners to approve purchases like a radio to take coroner calls.\n    \n            (Liesbeth Powers for ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Frustrated by how little Idaho officials knew and why they hadn\u2019t dug further into her mother\u2019s death, Amy Belanger channeled her grief into trying to find answers on her own.</p>\n\n<p>She followed a trail of public records left by Clayton Strong. Had he harmed other women? Had he been in a relationship with anybody who went missing? \u201cI was looking into his past to see if there was a pattern like that,\u201d Belanger said. Something she could share with officials in Idaho.</p>\n\n<p>Then she stumbled across a document: a recent marriage license.</p>\n\n<p>Three months after depositing Betty Strong\u2019s body at a hospital in Idaho, Clayton Strong wed a woman from Texas.</p>\n\n<p>Belanger needed to warn her.</p>\n\nTexas, 2017-2021\n<p>Shirley Weatherley had a lot in common with Betty Strong. She was a mother and grandmother. She\u2019d been married before. She lived in a small, modest home on a large piece of land in a rural locale, where she\u2019d been caring for a terminally ill former spouse when Strong contacted her on Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>They\u2019d known each other as teenagers in Lubbock. Their reconnection after he arrived at her house in Weatherford, a suburb of Fort Worth, eventually began to worry her children.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe isolated her,\u201d said\u00a0Jamie Barrington, Weatherley\u2019s son with a previous husband. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let grandkids, my brother \u2014 anybody\u2019d come over, he just kept them at arm\u2019s length.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Shirley Weatherley\n    \n            (Courtesy of Jamie Barrington)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Barrington said he and other members of Weatherley\u2019s family had suspicions about Strong. Then they connected with Belanger and heard what happened in Florida and Idaho.</p>\n\n<p>Belanger urged the family to tell their mother everything they\u2019d heard. She \u201cactually was pleading with us to watch out,\u201d Barrington recalled. </p>\n\n<p>Knowing another family was worried helped fuel Amy Belanger\u2019s quest for the truth about her mother\u2019s death. Her siblings chipped in to help Belanger rent a van and drive across the country in search of clues \u2014 anything that could shed light on her mother\u2019s death.</p>\n\n<p>Once she got to Idaho, Belanger spent more than a week investigating. She met with the coroner and sheriff. She went to the mining claims the Strongs had purchased. She stayed at the RV park where Betty Strong died and interviewed the people who\u2019d owned it in 2016; they remembered talking to each other about how \u201chinky\u201d the death and Clayton Strong\u2019s reaction to it seemed.</p>\n\n<p>Back in Texas, Weatherley\u2019s family tried to warn her. </p>\n\n<p>When they relayed the story about Betty Strong to her, Weatherley chalked it up to a grieving family trying to cope with loss by grasping for an explanation, Barrington said. After all, Strong had a death certificate that listed natural causes. </p>\n\n<p>The details Barrington later learned from family members and police about his mother\u2019s life with Strong were \u201cpretty horrific,\u201d he said. Weatherley had reported that Strong threatened to kill her, but no charges were filed. Then at one point, in the midst of an argument with Strong, Weatherley lobbed the accusations about Betty Strong\u2019s death at him, Barrington said. Strong flew into a rage.</p>\n\n<p>Weatherley called police in July 2021. She and Strong were splitting up, and he shoved her while moving his stuff out of the house, Weatherley told the officer. Strong had \u201churt her\u201d in the past, so she called police to make sure it didn\u2019t happen again, the officer\u2019s report says. The officer got Strong\u2019s side of the story \u2014 she was \u201crunning him off,\u201d but he didn\u2019t push her \u2014 and stuck around until Strong agreed to leave.</p>\n\n<p>Police would later document finding two items in the house. The first was a copy of Weatherley\u2019s will that left everything to Strong, on which she\u2019d written \u201cVOID,\u201d the second was a digital camera hidden in their bedroom. The camera contained selfies of injuries to her face and chest and a video of Strong putting his arm around her neck as she screamed for help.</p>\n\n<p>Strong persuaded Weatherley to let him back into their home once more on Aug. 4, 2021, according to police records.</p>\n\n<p>Four days later, Weatherley\u2019s son and grandson found her body wrapped in a gray tarp near the front steps to her home. She\u2019d been shot in the chest. Authorities matched shell casings at the scene to an AK-47-style rifle, which security footage showed Strong ditching in a shopping cart outside a Walmart.</p>\n\n<p>Picked up later by police in Mexico, Strong died of cardiac arrest while awaiting extradition in Weatherley\u2019s killing.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Mexican police booked Clayton Strong on gun charges in 2021. After the arrest, they discovered he was a suspect in the murder of his wife in Texas.\n    \n            (Parker County Sheriff\u2019s Office via Facebook)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \nToday\n<p>Jamie Barrington, Shirley Weatherley\u2019s son, was reluctant at first to speak publicly about his mother\u2019s death in Texas, even years later. He agreed to talk with ProPublica, he said, because he wants Idaho\u2019s coroner system to improve. He said he never imagined that a death like Betty Strong\u2019s could be ruled \u201cnatural\u201d based on what a spouse told authorities.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI truly believe that if there had been a proper investigation and not taking his word for it,\u201d Barrington said, \u201cthat it probably would have made a big difference\u201d in what happened to Shirley Weatherley.</p>\n\n<p>Word of Weatherley\u2019s murder eventually reached Funke, the coroner in Idaho. He said in hindsight, Strong\u2019s actions in Idaho County seem more suspicious than they did at the time to his inexperienced eyes and ears.</p>\n\n<p>Now, after 10 years as coroner, \u201cI would have pushed a little bit harder\u201d to have an officer or deputy follow up or go to the RV park with him. He would have asked police to use a national database \u2014 one he didn\u2019t know about at the time \u2014 to find Betty Strong\u2019s family members and learn more about her background. \u201cI have trust issues after cases like this,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Funke said the story of Betty Strong\u2019s death needs to be told, even if it shows that he and Idaho County made mistakes, because it can help lawmakers understand what is wrong with the state\u2019s system.</p>\n\n<p>Idaho\u2019s coroners need more funding, he said, because right now they\u2019re an afterthought in county budgets. Most counties set a coroner salary at what amounts to less than minimum wage, so it\u2019s impossible for someone like Funke to be coroner without a second, full-time job.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese offices should be fully staffed,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we have one or two people that are here full time to answer questions and respond to these calls, versus, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve got to take time off work, boss.\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And he believes new coroners who lack experience should be required to learn how to work a case from start to finish before they\u2019re called out to a death like Betty Strong\u2019s.</p>\n\n<p>Daniel Belanger, one of Betty Strong\u2019s children, came away from his interactions with Idaho County officials convinced that the only way deaths like his mother\u2019s will be properly investigated is through legislation forcing coroners and law enforcement agencies to change their approaches.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey completely dropped the ball,\u201d he told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>Amy Belanger said her family has reclaimed very few of her mother\u2019s possessions from the Airstream trailer. Strong emptied the Florida house of family heirlooms after their mother\u2019s death, Belanger said. Most of the family photo albums her mother toiled over are gone.</p>\n\n<p>The brown house on the winding road in Florida is still there. Belanger\u2019s memories of family cookouts and holiday gatherings linger in the house; they weren\u2019t wiped away by the police visits and padlocked doors. But the family home isn\u2019t the family\u2019s anymore. Years later, it is stuck in legal limbo \u2014 the deed still in the name of Clayton Strong and Shirley Weatherley, the woman he married after the death of Betty Strong.</p>",

Additionally, the Defense Department requires that people handling sensitive data be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. </p>\n\n<p>This presented an issue for Microsoft, which relies on a vast global workforce with significant operations in India, China and the European Union.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                        \n    \n        Microsoft established its low-profile \u201cdigital escort\u201d program to get around this prohibition.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Microsoft\u2019s foreign workforce is not permitted to access sensitive cloud systems directly, so the tech giant hired U.S.-based \u201cdigital escorts,\u201d who had security clearances that authorized them to access sensitive information, to take direction from the overseas experts. The engineers might briefly describe the job to be completed \u2014 for instance, updating a firewall, installing an update to fix a bug or reviewing logs to troubleshoot a problem. Then the escort copies and pastes the engineer\u2019s commands into the federal cloud.</p>\n\n<p>The problem, ProPublica found, is that digital escorts don\u2019t necessarily have the advanced technical expertise needed to spot problems.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trusting that what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t malicious, but we really can\u2019t tell,\u201d said one current escort.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        The escorts handle data that, if leaked, would have \u201ccatastrophic\u201d effects.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Microsoft uses the escort system to handle the government\u2019s most sensitive information that falls below \u201cclassified.\u201d According to the government, this includes \u201cdata that involves the protection of life and financial ruin.\u201d The \u201closs of confidentiality, integrity, or availability\u201d of this information \u201ccould be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect\u201d on operations, assets and individuals, the government has said.</p>\n\n<p>Defense Department data in this category includes materials that directly support military operations.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                        \n    \n        The program could expose Pentagon data to cyberattacks.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Because the U.S.-based escorts are taking direction from foreign engineers, including those based in China, the nation\u2019s greatest cyber adversary, it is possible that an escort could unwittingly insert malicious code into the Defense Department\u2019s computer systems.</p>\n\n<p>A former Microsoft engineer who worked on the system acknowledged this possibility. \u201cIf someone ran a script called \u2018fix_servers.sh\u2019 but it actually did something malicious, then [escorts] would have no idea,\u201d the engineer, Matthew Erickson, told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>Pradeep Nair, a former Microsoft vice president who said he helped develop the concept from the start, said a variety of safeguards including audit logs, the digital trail of system activity, could alert Microsoft or the government to potential problems. \u201cBecause these controls are stringent, residual risk is minimal,\u201d Nair said.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        Digital escorts present a natural opportunity for spies, experts say.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cIf I were an operative, I would look at that as an avenue for extremely valuable access. We need to be very concerned about that,\u201d said Harry Coker, who was a senior executive at the CIA and the National Security Agency. Coker, who also was national cyber director during the Biden administration, added that he and his former intelligence colleagues \u201cwould love to have had access like that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Chinese laws allow government officials there to collect data \u201cas long as they\u2019re doing something that they\u2019ve deemed legitimate,\u201d said Jeremy Daum, senior research fellow at the Paul Tsai China Center at Yale Law School. Microsoft\u2019s China-based tech support for the U.S. government presents an opening for Chinese espionage, \u201cwhether it be putting someone who\u2019s already an intelligence professional into one of those jobs, or going to the people who are in the jobs and pumping them for information,\u201d Daum said. \u201cIt would be difficult for any Chinese citizen or company to meaningfully resist a direct request from security forces or law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                        \n    \n        Microsoft says the program is government-approved.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In a statement, Microsoft said that its personnel and contractors operate in a manner \u201cconsistent with US Government requirements and processes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The company\u2019s global workers \u201chave no direct access to customer data or customer systems,\u201d the statement said. Escorts \u201cwith the appropriate clearances and training provide direct support. These personnel are provided specific training on protecting sensitive data, preventing harm, and use of the specific commands/controls within the environment.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Insight Global \u2014 a contractor that provides digital escorts to Microsoft \u2014 said it \u201cevaluates the technical capabilities of each resource throughout the interview process to ensure they possess the technical skills required\u201d for the job and provides training.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        Microsoft says it disclosed details of the escort program to the government. Former Pentagon officials said they\u2019d never heard of it.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Microsoft told ProPublica that it described the escort model in documents submitted to the government as part of cloud vendor authorization processes. Former defense and intelligence officials said in interviews that they had never heard of digital escorts. Even the Defense Department\u2019s IT agency didn\u2019t know about it until reached for comment by ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI probably should have known about this,\u201d said John Sherman, who was chief information officer for the Defense Department during the Biden administration. He said the system is a major security risk for the department and called for a \u201cthorough review by [the Defense Information Systems Agency], Cyber Command and other stakeholders that are involved in this.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>DISA said, \u201cExperts under escort supervision have no direct, hands-on access to government systems; but rather offer guidance and recommendations to authorized administrators who perform tasks.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                        \n    \n        There were warnings early on about the risks.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Multiple people raised concerns about the escort strategy over the years, including while it was still in development. A former Microsoft employee, who was involved in the company\u2019s cybersecurity strategy, told an executive they opposed the concept, viewing it as too risky from a security perspective. </p>\n\n<p>Around 2016, Microsoft engaged contacts from Lockheed Martin to hire escorts. The project manager says they told their counterpart at Microsoft they were concerned the escorts would not have the \u201cright eyes\u201d for the job given the relatively low pay.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft did not respond to questions about these points.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        Other cloud providers wouldn\u2019t say if they also use escorts.\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>It\u2019s unclear whether other major cloud service providers to the federal government also use digital escorts in tech support. Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud declined to comment on the record for this article. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with his Chinese counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, at the ASEAN Summit. Rubio described the exchange as \u201cconstructive\u201d and hinted at a possible upcoming meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. China described the exchange as \u201cconstructive and pragmatic.\u201d</p><p>This exchange followed the comments of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, at the Shangri-La Dialogues in Singapore on May 31, 2025: \u201cAny attempt by China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world.\u201d Despite these words of caution, in mid-June 2025 and in preceding months, China deployed fighter jets, naval vessels and drones around Taiwan in air-sea joint training exercises meant to intimidate Taipei.</p><p>China\u2019s recent actions in the Yellow Sea, to include incursions into South Korean territorial waters and airspace, are also of concern. This comes at a time when China continues to claim all of the South China Sea as their own, despite a United Nations Tribunal\u2019s 2016 ruling that China\u2019s claims to the South China Sea, based on its \u201cnine dash line\u201d map, were not legally valid.</p><p>There is considerable concern that China will use its military to invade or blockade Taiwan by 2027, when China supposedly would have the military might to attempt unification by force. That would be a grave mistake.</p><p>The U.S. \u2013 China relationship is tense, with some predicting an eventual war, despite $582.4 billion in total trade with China in 2024, $126.9 billion of U.S. foreign direct investment in China and over 277,000 Chinese students studying in the U.S. China\u2019s actions in the South China, East China and Yellow Seas and their attempted military intimidation of Taiwan all contribute to this tense relationship.</p><p><strong>The U.S. was there for China</strong></p><p>The U.S. was there for China when Deng Xiaoping reached out to the U.S. in 1979, after normalization of relations, and established a strategic relationship with the U.S. that contributed to the defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, the end of the Cold War in 1991 and joint U.S. \u2013 China cooperation on counter terrorism, counter nuclear proliferation, counter narcotics and joint efforts to counter international organized crime. And there were over 300,000 Chinese students studying in the U.S. with significant U.S. investment in China, which contributed to providing China with Most Favored Nation status in 2000, a move that exponentially expanded bilateral trade.</p><p>And it was the U.S. that got China into the World Trade Organization in December 2001. Indeed, China\u2019s membership in WTO favorably impacted China\u2019s economic development; it was a catalyst for China\u2019s economic growth and modernization.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

The willingness of these two superpowers to work jointly on these global problems, as we did in the 1980s and 1990s, would be welcomed by all countries, except for the Russian Federation and Iran.</p><p>The recent meeting of Marco Rubio and Wang Yi and hopefully the eventual meeting of Presidents Xi and Trump could be the beginning of a relationship that not only deals with the tension in the bilateral relationship but also deals with the common good both nations could do if we worked together on a myriad of socio-economic and geopolitical challenges confronting the global community. Moving in this would require bold and sustained leadership, reminiscent of the 1980s and 1990s. </p><p><strong><em>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in </em></strong><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/14/china-improve-relations-us/\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Times</a></em></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</em></strong></p>",

In an email obtained by ProPublica, De Mello said he had identified multiple legal \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the agency\u2019s request.</p>\n\n<p>Two days later, on June 27, De Mello was forced out of his job, people familiar with the dispute said. The addresses have not yet been released to ICE. De Mello did not respond to requests for comment, and the administration did not address questions sent by ProPublica about his departure.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Government Efficiency began pushing the IRS to provide taxpayer data to immigration agents soon after President Donald Trump took office. The tax agency\u2019s acting general counsel refused and was replaced by De Mello, who Trump administration officials viewed as more willing to carry out the president\u2019s agenda. Soon after, the Department of Homeland Security, ICE\u2019s parent agency, and the IRS negotiated a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d that included specific legal guardrails to safeguard taxpayers\u2019 private information.</p>\n\n<p>In his email, De Mello said ICE\u2019s request for millions of records did not meet those requirements, which include having a written assurance that each taxpayer whose address is being sought was under active criminal investigation.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s just no way ICE has 7 million real criminal investigations, that\u2019s a fantasy,\u201d said a former senior IRS official who had been advising the agency on this issue. The demands from the DHS were \u201cunprecedented,\u201d the official added, saying the agency was pressing the IRS to do what amounted to \u201ca big data dump.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In the past, when law enforcement sought IRS data to support its investigations, agencies would give the IRS the full legal name of the target, an address on file and an explanation of why the information was relevant to a criminal inquiry. Such requests rarely involved more than a dozen people at a time, former IRS officials said.</p>\n\n<p>Danny Werfel, IRS commissioner during the Biden administration, said the privacy laws allowing federal investigators to obtain taxpayer data have never \u201cbeen read to open the door to the sharing of thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of tax records for a broad-based enforcement initiative.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for the White House said the planned use of IRS data was legal and a means of fulfilling Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to carry out mass deportations of \u201cillegal criminal aliens.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Taxpayer data is among the most confidential in the federal government and is protected by strict privacy laws, which have historically limited its transfer to law enforcement and other government agencies. Unauthorized disclosure of taxpayer return information is a felony that can carry a penalty of up to five years in prison.</p>\n\n<p>The system that the IRS is now creating would give ICE automated access to home addresses en masse, limiting the ability of IRS officials to consider the legality of transfers. IRS insiders who reviewed a copy of the blueprint said it could result in immigration agents raiding wrong or outdated addresses.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf this program is implemented in its current form, it\u2019s extremely likely that incorrect addresses will be given to DHS and individuals will be wrongly targeted,\u201d said an IRS engineer who examined the blueprints and who, like other officials, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute that ended in De Mello\u2019s ouster was the culmination of months of pressure on the IRS to turn over massive amounts of data in ways that would redefine the relationship between the agency and law enforcement and reduce taxpayers\u2019 privacy, records and interviews show.</p>\n\n<p>In one meeting in late March between senior IRS and DHS officials, a top ICE official made a suggestion: Why doesn\u2019t Homeland Security simply provide the name and state of its targets and have the IRS return the addresses of everyone who matches that criteria?</p>\n\n<p>The IRS lawyers were stunned. They feared they could face criminal liability if they handed over the addresses of individuals who were not under a criminal investigation. The conversation and news of deeper collaboration with ICE so disturbed career staff that it led to a series of departures in late March and early April across the IRS\u2019 legal, IT and privacy offices.</p>\n\n<p>They were \u201cpushing the boundaries of the law,\u201d one official said. \u201cEveryone at IRS felt the same way.\u201d</p>\n\nThe Blueprint\n<p>The technical blueprint obtained by ProPublica shows that engineers at the agency are preparing to give DHS what it wants: a system that enables massive automated data sharing. The goal is to launch the new system before the end of July, two people familiar with the matter said.</p>\n\n<p>The DHS effort to obtain IRS data comes as top immigration enforcement leaders face escalating White House pressure to deport some 3,000 people per day, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ices-tactics-draw-criticism-it-triples-daily-arrest-targets-2025-06-10/\">according to reports</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One federal agent tasked with assisting ICE on deportations said recent operations have been hamstrung by outdated addresses. Better information could dramatically speed up arrests. \u201cSome of the leads that they were giving us were old,\u201d said the agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the press. \u201cThey\u2019re like from two administrations ago.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In early March, immigrants rights groups <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278147/gov.uscourts.dcd.278147.1.0.pdf\">sued the IRS</a> hoping to block the plan, arguing that the memorandum of understanding between DHS and the IRS is illegal. But a judge in early May <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278147/gov.uscourts.dcd.278147.67.0.pdf\">ruled against them</a>, saying the broader agreement complied with Section 6103, the existing law regulating IRS data sharing. That opened the door for engineers to begin building the system.</p>\n\n<p>The judge did not address the technical blueprint, which didn\u2019t exist at the time of the ruling. But the case is pending, which means the new system could still come under legal review.</p>\n\n<p>Until now, little was known about the push and pull between the two agencies or the exact technical mechanics behind the arrangement.</p>\n\n<p>The plan has been shrouded in secrecy even within the IRS, with details of its development withheld from regular communications. Several IRS engineers and lawyers have avoided working on the project out of concerns about personal legal risk.</p>\n\n<p>Asked about the new system, a spokesperson for IRS parent agency the Treasury Department said the memorandum of understanding, often called an MOU, \u201chas been litigated and determined to be a lawful application of Section 6103, which provides for information sharing by the IRS in precise circumstances associated with law enforcement requests.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>At a time when Trump is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366178/trump-deport-jail-u-s-citizens-homegrowns-el-salvador\">making threats</a> to deport not only undocumented immigrants but also U.S. citizens, the scope of information-sharing with the IRS could continue to grow, according to documents reviewed by ProPublica and sources familiar with the matter: DHS has been looking for ways to expand the agreement that could allow Homeland Security officials to seek IRS data on Americans being investigated for various crimes.</p>\n\n<p>Last month, an ICE attorney proposed updating the MOU to authorize new data requests on people \u201cassociated with criminal activities which may include United States citizens or lawful permanent residents,\u201d according to a document seen by ProPublica. The status of this proposal is unclear. De Mello, at the time, rejected it and called for senior Treasury Department leadership to personally sign off on such a significant change.</p>\n\n<p>The White House described DHS\u2019 work with the IRS as a good-faith effort to identify and deport those who are living in the country illegally.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cProPublica continues to degrade their already terrible reputation by suggesting we should turn a blind eye to criminal illegal aliens present in the United States for the sake of trying to collect tax payments from them,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement after receiving questions about the blueprint from ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>She pointed to the April MOU as giving the government the authority to create the new system and added, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a surveillance system. \u2026 It\u2019s part of President Trump\u2019s promise to carry out the mass deportation of criminal illegal aliens \u2014 the promise that the American people elected him on and he is committed to fulfilling.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In a separate statement, a senior DHS official also cited the court\u2019s approval of the MOU, saying that it \u201coutlines a process to ensure that sensitive taxpayer information is protected while allowing law enforcement to effectively pursue criminal violations.\u201d</p>\n\nHow the System Works\n<p>The new system would represent a sea change, allowing law enforcement to request enormous swaths of confidential data in bulk through an automated, computerized process.</p>\n\n<p>The system, according to the blueprint and interviews with IRS engineers, would work like this:</p>\n\n<p>First, DHS would send the IRS a spreadsheet containing the names and previous addresses of the people it\u2019s targeting. The request would include the date of a final removal order, a relevant criminal statute ICE is using to investigate the individual, and the tax period for which information is sought. If DHS fails to include any of this information, the system would reject the request.</p>\n\n<p>The system then attempts to match the information provided by the DHS to a specific taxpayer identification number, which is the primary method by which the IRS identifies an individual in its databases.</p>\n\n<p>If the system makes a match, it accesses the individual\u2019s associated tax file and pulls the address listed during the most recent tax period. Then the system would produce a new spreadsheet enriched with taxpayer data that contains DHS\u2019 targets\u2019 last known addresses. The spreadsheet would include a record of names rejected for lack of required information and names for which it could not make a match.</p>\n\n<p>Tax and privacy experts say they worry about how such a powerful yet crude platform could make dangerous mistakes. Because the search starts with a name instead of a taxpayer identification number, it risks returning the address of an innocent person with the same name as or a similar address to that of one of ICE\u2019s targets. The proposed system assumes the data provided by DHS is accurate and that each targeted individual is the subject of a valid criminal investigation. In effect, the IRS has no way to independently check the bases of these requests, experts told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the blueprint does not limit the amount of data that can be transferred or how often DHS can request it. The system could easily be expanded to acquire all the information the IRS holds on taxpayers, said technical experts and IRS engineers who reviewed the documents. By shifting a single parameter, the program could return more information than just a target\u2019s address, said an engineer familiar with the plan, including employer and familial relationships.</p>\n\n<p>Engineers based at IRS offices in Lanham, Maryland, and Dallas are developing the blueprint.</p>\n\n\u201cGone Back on Its Word\u201d\n<p>For decades, the American government has encouraged everyone who makes an income in the U.S. to pay taxes \u2014 regardless of immigration status \u2014 with an implicit promise that their information would be protected. Now that same data may be used to locate and deport noncitizens.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor years, the IRS has told immigrants that it only cares that they pay their taxes,\u201d said Nandan Joshi, an attorney with the Public Citizen Litigation Group, which is seeking to block the data-sharing agreement in federal court. \u201cBy agreeing to share taxpayer data with ICE on a mass basis, the IRS has gone back on its word.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The push to share IRS data with DHS emerged while Elon Musk\u2019s <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/elon-musk-doge-tracker/\">DOGE</a> reshaped the engineering staff of the IRS. Sam Corcos, a Silicon Valley startup founder with no government experience, pushed out more than 50 IRS engineers and restructured the agency\u2019s engineering priorities while he was the senior DOGE official at the agency. He later became chief information officer at Treasury. He has also led a separate IRS effort to create a master database using products from Silicon Valley giant Palantir Technologies, enabling the government to link and search large swaths of data.</p>\n\n<p>Corcos didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The White House said DOGE is not part of the DHS-IRS pact.</p>\n\n<p>Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance, which oversees the IRS, told ProPublica the system being built was ripe for abuse. It \u201cwould allow an outside agency unprecedented access to IRS records for reasons that have nothing to do with tax administration, opening the door to endless fishing expeditions,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the department\u2019s internal watchdog, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-doge-irs-treasury-tigta-inspector-general-probe\">is already probing efforts by Trump and DOGE</a><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-doge-irs-treasury-tigta-inspector-general-probe\"> </a>to obtain private taxpayer data and other sensitive information, ProPublica reported in April.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration continues to add government agencies to its deportation drive.</p>\n\n<p>DOGE and DHS are also working to build a national citizenship database, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/29/nx-s1-5409608/citizenship-trump-privacy-voting-database\">NPR reported last month</a>. The database links information from the Social Security Administration and the DHS, ostensibly for the purpose of allowing state and local election officials to verify U.S. citizenship.</p>\n\n<p>And in May, a senior Treasury Department official directed 250 IRS criminal investigative agents to help deportation operations, a significant shift for two agencies that historically have had separate missions.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/mac-funk\">McKenzie Funk</a> contributed reporting, and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/kirsten-berg\">Kirsten Berg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/alex-mierjeski\">Alex Mierjeski</a> contributed research.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>\u201cThe most important part right now is that Europe would be able to buy military equipment here in the U.S. so we can donate these military systems directly to Ukraine. That is also discussion going on right now. I think [President] Trump is on the right path here. I think he has promised that would be a possibility. We are talking in these hours about 10 Patriot [missile defense] systems and I think the outcome of that discussion will be that European countries will be able to buy the Patriot systems and then donate them directly to Ukraine and that's important because the discussions two months ago were, in fact, that there were no more to buy here in the U.S. So the outcome of the discussion right now is moving in a better direction.\u201d</p><p>That was Denmark\u2019s Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen, speaking one week ago at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), where he appeared along with Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, Denmark\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs. They discussed not just Ukraine and NATO, but also their relations with the U.S., Greenland, the critical minerals issue and Denmark\u2019s goals in taking over the Presidency of the European Union (EU) for the next six months.</p><p>The two had been in Washington for several days of meeting with senior Trump officials, and Members of Congress, in part because Denmark has assumed the Presidency of the European Union and plans to make military preparedness a hallmark of the country\u2019s six month leadership term.</p><p>Last Tuesday, Poulsen explained the reasoning for European nations to buy weapons from the U.S. for Ukraine, which Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte announced at the White House yesterday. He and Rasmussen also explained the background of the European nations\u2019 decision-making as well as their views of activities here in Washington and the rest of the world.</p><p>Foreign Minister Rasmussen gave his own assessment of the situation in Moscow, saying, \u201cYou shouldn't overestimate the power of Russia. I mean we have weakened the [Russian] economy. They are now on a war footing so to speak. They spend more on military than in health and education and everything civilized combined. They have huge casualties, high inflation. I mean if it was a more open transparent society with some kind of internal discussions, things would have been very, very, different. If you compare the casualties with what they lost in Afghanistan and decided to withdraw, it's much worse.\u201d</p><p>A former two-time Danish Prime Minister, Rasmussen continued, \u201cBut of course it's a closed society and it is a one-man-takes-all-decisions-kind-of-society. It's not a democracy, but it is within our hands, so to speak, to actually crash Putin and his war machine.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen then added, \u201cThe big question is whether we [Denmark and the other NATO and EU countries] have, you know, the readiness, the willingness to do so, and here of course we need the U.S. I mean it goes without saying that Europe has to pay a bigger part of the bill. We do. We [Europe] now account for like 70% of the total support to Ukraine. That number will go up, but we need the U.S. on board as well, not least when we are talking sanctions and pressure on Putin.\u201d</p><p>As Rasmussen pointed out, tiny Denmark supplies quite a bit by itself. \u201cWe are the fourth biggest contributor to Ukraine,\u201d he said, \u201cso it's like U.S., U.K. [United Kingdom], Germany, and then Denmark. Per capita, we are so far the biggest. We spend like plus 1,500 Euros [$1,754] per capita in Denmark. It's more than the double compared to the second biggest spender in Europe.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

So that's my main objective to be here [in Washington].\u201d</p><p>Poulsen added, \u201cTrump is quite much aware of that. And also [Defense Secretary] Pete Hegseth and [Secretary of State] Mario Rubio [both of whom they had met with]. They are aware that they have to speed up all these processes \u2014 too much red tape in delivering to Europe. And when we are coming to U.S. saying we would like to buy even more military equipment, then I don't think the answer should be you have to wait seven or eight years to get it.\u201d</p><p>Poulsen also said, \u201cEurope will do more and I think the outcome of the situation in Ukraine is also the demanding question for Europe to be able to invest more and also build up more [military] capacity,\u201d which he described as among the \u201clessons learned from Ukraine.\u201d</p><p>At one point Rasmussen said he had met briefly with Trump during the June NATO meeting at The Hague. \u201cI told him when we met last time when I was prime minister, we only spent like 1.5 percent [of the nation\u2019s GDP] in Denmark [for our defense spending]\u2026Then the whole thing happened in Ukraine. Now there's totally new sense of urgency. This year Denmark spends 3.2 percent, exactly the same as U.S. It is a clear commitment from our government that we will meet the 3.5 percent [NATO goal by 2035].\u201d</p><p>Ukraine has shown itself to be very strong in creating new and innovative defense companies, they both said, but investment in arms manufacturing outside Ukraine is what they talked about. Rasmussen said, \u201cBasically it's about buying from Ukraine to Ukraine.\u201d </p><p><span></span>He described that when the war started Ukraine had a weapons industry of some $3 billion, but it is now up to $40 billion, although Ukrainians \u201conly have finance for half of it.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen said an answer has been that \u201cwe [the Danes] have spent our own money and we also have the honor to be the facilitator of some of these [Russian] frozen assets or the interest linked to the frozen asset. So that is the basis of the Danish model and now we are working on making, you know, real investments\u2026with our Ukrainian friends to set up Ukrainian investments in Denmark to give them some kind of safe haven.\u201d</p><p>Other European countries have followed, and together with the Ukrainians they are producing arms not just for Ukraine, but for their own militaries. \u201cWe should be inspired of what the Ukrainians lesson learned from their battlefield,\u201d Rasmussen said, \u201cand that's why it makes sense also to invest not only to assist them [Ukrainians], but also to make some kind of technology transferring from Ukraine to our own military.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

So in two months they were able to produce the Bohdana systems. It was very cheap and the spare parts, the maintenance, all that kind of thing are, of course, being done directly near the front line. So it has been a huge success and right now we're looking into also developing new capabilities or finance new capabilities for the defense companies in Ukraine. That would be missiles, that would be drones. It's under Ukrainian defense demands that they ask for this and we reimburse [pay for] the contracts.\u201d</p><p>With some $20 billion from Europeans and others available, Poulsen explained, \u201cthe best way we can do for our friends in Ukraine to keep up fighting is in fact to give money directly into the [Ukraine] defense companies.\u201d</p><p>Poulsen called it Danish model 2.0. and said, \u201cThat's to invite some of the [Ukraine] defense companies to have a safe haven in Denmark to produce what they will need in Ukraine, hopefully all also in Germany and other European countries.\u201d</p><p>Poulsen also described a new approach involving Denmark, Germany and Nordic countries \u2014 jointly buying weapons systems.</p><p>As an example, Poulsen said that Denmark, Norway and Sweden are looking into buying the P-8A Poseidon U.S. Navy multi-mission maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft. He said it was a capability they already have in Norway and Germany, but \u201cnot buying it ourselves [individually]\u2026we'll also have some capabilities that we could use together with Sweden and Norway\u2026So that will be the way forward.\u201d</p><p>As for Greenland, Rasmussen said he did not really discuss the matter in any depth when he met with Rubio because \u201cwe [the Danes] have the slogan \u2018nothing about Greenland without Greenland [being present].\u2019 Even though the foreign security policy [of Greenland] is, you know, the Danish government's responsibility, we have developed a good tradition or custom that if we are, you know, really negotiating with the third countries about these issues we will have our Greenlandic colleague [with us].\u201d</p><p>Greenland, he said, was discussed \u201cin a more generally way.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen said the Danes were \u201ctaken by surprise\u201d by Trump\u2019s announcement that for both U.S. national security and international security it was necessary that Washington annex Greenland.</p><p>Rasmussen, who was Danish Prime Minister from 2016-to-2019 during Trump\u2019s first term, said, \u201cI have experienced with Trump so many times that whatever he says\u2026and whatever he proposes there's always some kind of rational substance behind it. I mean, and we share the view, that we have to be present in the Arctic in a different way. But it shouldn't be in a fight between the kingdom of Denmark and U.S. It should be by combining forces and we have the framework for that.\u201d</p><p>He explained that the Danes \u201chave been pushing for including [the] Arctic in the capability targets in NATO. And, to some extent, we were successful. There's now a kind of principal agreement among the NATO Arctic countries, including U.S., that this is something we should do under the framework of the NATO.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen added, \u201cSo it's not that the Greenlandic issue is solved. I think because apart from these rational arguments, I can't get rid of the idea that there's also just this [Trump] vision of creating a bigger U.S. and we can, of course, not accommodate that.\u201d</p><p>Rasmussen added, \u201cI must say I leave Washington a bit more optimistic compared to when I arrived. I think the statement made by the president [Trump] after his [most recent] telephone conversations with [Russian President] Putin and [Ukraine President] Zelensky prove that he now to a larger extent share our analysis of the situation. I mean it was a bit confusing earlier this year when he had Zelensky in the Oval Office who is the bad guy, who is the good guy. That has shifted. I think the [Hague] NATO summit was also important. I mean I really feel and think he [Trump] has perhaps the most positive view on Europe he has had for a while, at least.\u201d</p><p>All that has turned out to have been realistic. Let\u2019s hope Trump stays on his current trajectory.</p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

Some are former military personnel with little coding experience who are paid barely more than minimum wage for the work.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trusting that what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t malicious, but we really can\u2019t tell,\u201d said one current escort who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, fearing professional repercussions. </p>\n\n<p>The system has been in place for nearly a decade, though its existence is being reported publicly here for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft told ProPublica that it has disclosed details about the escort model to the federal government. But former government officials said in interviews that they had never heard of digital escorts. The program appears to be so low-profile that even the Defense Department\u2019s IT agency had difficulty finding someone familiar with it. \u201cLiterally no one seems to know anything about this, so I don\u2019t know where to go from here,\u201d said Deven King, spokesperson for the Defense Information Systems Agency. </p>\n\n<p>National security and cybersecurity experts contacted by ProPublica were also surprised to learn that such an arrangement was in place, especially at a time when the U.S. intelligence community and leading members of Congress and the Trump administration view China\u2019s digital prowess as a top threat to the country.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2024-Unclassified-Report.pdf\">Office of the Director of National Intelligence has called China</a> the \u201cmost active and persistent cyber threat to U.S. Government, private-sector, and critical infrastructure networks.\u201d One of the most prominent examples of that threat came in 2023, when Chinese hackers infiltrated the cloud-based mailboxes of senior U.S. government officials, stealing data and emails from the commerce secretary, the U.S. ambassador to China and others working on national security matters. The intruders <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-03/CSRBReviewOfTheSummer2023MEOIntrusion508.pdf\">downloaded about 60,000 emails</a> from the State Department alone.</p>\n\n<p>With President Donald Trump and his allies concerned about spying, the State Department announced plans in May to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/05/new-visa-policies-put-america-first-not-china/\">aggressively revoke visas</a> for Chinese students\u201d \u2014 a pledge that <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114664632971715644\">the president seems to have walked back</a>. The administration is also trying to arrange the sale of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/30/tech/trump-tiktok-who-could-buy\">the popular social media platform TikTok</a>, which is owned by a Chinese company that some lawmakers believe could hand over sensitive U.S. user data to Beijing and fuel misinformation with its content recommendations. But experts told ProPublica that digital escorting poses a far greater threat to national security than either of those issues and is a natural opportunity for spies.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf I were an operative, I would look at that as an avenue for extremely valuable access. We need to be very concerned about that,\u201d said <a href=\"https://commerce.maryland.gov/commerce/harry-coker-jr\">Harry Coker</a>, who was a senior executive at the CIA and the National Security Agency. Coker, who also was national cyber director during the Biden administration, added that he and his former intelligence community colleagues \u201cwould love to have had access like that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It is difficult to know whether engineers overseen by digital escorts have ever carried out a cyberattack against the U.S. government. But Coker wondered whether it \u201ccould be part of an explanation for a lot of the challenges we have faced over the years.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft uses the escort system to handle the government\u2019s most sensitive information that falls below \u201cclassified.\u201d According to the government, this <a href=\"https://www.fedramp.gov/understanding-baselines-and-impact-levels/#:~:text=High%20Impact%20data%20is%20usually,services%20across%20the%20federal%20government.\">\u201chigh impact level\u201d category includes \u201cdata that involves</a> the protection of life and financial ruin.\u201d The \u201closs of confidentiality, integrity, or availability\u201d of this information \u201ccould be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect\u201d on operations, assets and individuals, the government has said. In the Defense Department, the data is categorized as \u201cImpact Level\u201d 4 and 5 and includes materials that directly support military operations. </p>\n\n<p>John Sherman, who was <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/2881098/john-sherman/\">chief information officer</a> for the Department of Defense during the Biden administration, said he was surprised and concerned to learn of ProPublica\u2019s findings. \u201cI probably should have known about this,\u201d he said. He told the news organization that the situation warrants a \u201cthorough review by DISA, Cyber Command and other stakeholders that are involved in this.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In an emailed statement, the Defense Information Systems Agency said that cloud service providers \u201care required to establish and maintain controls for vetting and using qualified specialists,\u201d but the agency did not respond to ProPublica\u2019s questions regarding the digital escorts\u2019 qualifications.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s unclear whether other cloud providers to the federal government use digital escorts as part of their tech support. Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud declined to comment on the record for this article. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft declined to make executives available for interviews for this article. In response to emailed questions, the company provided a statement saying its personnel and contractors operate in a manner \u201cconsistent with US Government requirements and processes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Global workers \u201chave no direct access to customer data or customer systems,\u201d the statement said. Escorts \u201cwith the appropriate clearances and training provide direct support. These personnel are provided specific training on protecting sensitive data, preventing harm, and use of the specific commands/controls within the environment.\u201d In addition, Microsoft said it has an internal review process known as \u201cLockbox\u201d to \u201cmake sure the request is deemed safe or has any cause for concern.\u201d A company spokesperson declined to provide specifics about how it works but said it\u2019s built into the system and involves review by a Microsoft employee in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>Over the years, various people involved in the work, including a Microsoft cybersecurity leader, warned the company that the arrangement is inherently risky, those people told ProPublica. Despite the presence of an escort, foreign engineers are privy to granular details about the federal cloud \u2014 the kind of information hackers could exploit. Moreover, the U.S. escorts overseeing these workers are ill equipped to spot suspicious activity, two of the people said.</p>\n\n<p>Even those who helped develop the escort system acknowledge the people doing the work may not be able to detect problems.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf someone ran a script called \u2018fix_servers.sh\u2019 but it actually did something malicious then [escorts] would have no idea,\u201d Matthew Erickson, a former Microsoft engineer who worked on the escort system, told ProPublica in an email. That said, he maintained that the \u201cscope of systems they could disrupt\u201d is limited.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    <p>The Defense Department requires anyone working with its most sensitive data to be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national or permanent resident. \u201cNo Foreign persons may have such access,\u201d according to the department\u2019s cloud security requirements. Microsoft, however, has a global workforce, so it created the digital escort system as a work-around. Here\u2019s an example of how it works and the risk it poses:</p>\n<p>Tech support is needed on a Microsoft cloud product.\n  </p>\n<p>A Microsoft engineer in China files an online \u201cticket\u201d to take on the work.\n  </p>\n<p>A U.S.-based escort picks up the ticket.\n</p>\n<p>The engineer and the escort meet on the Microsoft Teams conferencing platform.\n</p>\n<p>The engineer sends computer commands to the U.S. escort, presenting an opportunity to insert malicious code.\n</p>\n<p>The escort, who may not have advanced technical expertise, inputs the commands into the federal cloud system.\n</p>\n<p><em>Illustrations for ProPublica</em></p>\n\n\n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>A Microsoft contractor called Insight Global <a href=\"https://jobs.insightglobal.com/find_a_job/washington/job-331977/\">posted an ad in January</a> seeking an escort to bring engineers without security clearances \u201cinto the secured environment\u201d of the federal government and to \u201cprotect confidential and secure information from spillage,\u201d an industry term for a data leak. The pay started at $18 an hour.</p>\n\n<p>While the ad said that specific technical skills were \u201chighly preferred\u201d and \u201cnice to have,\u201d the main prerequisite was possessing a valid \u201csecret\u201d level clearance issued by the Defense Department.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPeople are getting these jobs because they are cleared, not because they\u2019re software engineers,\u201d said the escort who agreed to speak anonymously and who works for Insight Global.</p>\n\n<p>Each month, the company\u2019s roughly 50-person escort team fields hundreds of interactions with Microsoft\u2019s China-based engineers and developers, inputting those workers\u2019 commands into federal networks, the employee said. </p>\n\n<p>In a statement to ProPublica, Insight Global said it \u201cevaluates the technical capabilities of each resource throughout the interview process to ensure they possess the technical skills required\u201d for the job, and provides training. The company noted that escorts also receive additional cyber and \u201cinsider threat awareness\u201d training as part of the government security clearance process.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhile a security clearance may be required for the role, it is but one piece of the puzzle,\u201d the company said. </p>\n\n<p>Microsoft did not respond to questions about Insight Global.</p>\n\n\u201cThe Path of Least Resistance\u201d\n<p>When modern cloud technology emerged in the 2000s, offering on-demand computing power and data storage via the internet, it ushered in fundamental changes to federal government operations. </p>\n\n<p>For decades, federal departments used computer servers owned and operated by the government itself to house data and power networks. Shifting to the cloud meant moving that work to massive off-site data centers managed by tech companies. </p>\n\n<p>Federal officials believed that the cloud would provide greater power, efficiency and cost savings. But the transition also meant that the government would cede some control over who maintained and accessed its information to companies like Microsoft, whose employees would take over tasks previously handled by federal IT workers. </p>\n\n<p>To address the risks of this revolution, the government <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220210115924/https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/assets/egov_docs/fedrampmemo.pdf\">started the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program</a>, known as FedRAMP, in 2011. Under the program, companies that wanted to sell their cloud services to the government had to establish how they would ensure that personnel working with sensitive federal data would have the requisite \u201caccess authorizations\u201d and background screenings. On top of that, the Defense Department had its own cloud guidelines, requiring that people handling sensitive data be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. </p>\n\n<p>This presented an issue for Microsoft, given its reliance on a vast global workforce, with significant operations in India, China and the European Union. So the company tapped a senior program manager named Indy Crowley to put federal officials at ease. Known for his familiarity with the rules and his ability to converse in the government\u2019s acronym-heavy lingo, colleagues dubbed him the \u201cFedRAMP whisperer.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In an interview, Crowley told ProPublica that he appealed directly to FedRAMP leadership, arguing that the relative risk from Microsoft\u2019s global workforce was minimal. To make his point, he said he once grilled a FedRAMP official on the provenance of code in products supplied by other government vendors such as IBM. The official couldn\u2019t say with certainty that only U.S. citizens had worked on the product in question, he said. The cloud, Crowley argued, should not be treated any differently.</p>\n\n<p>Crowley said he also met with prospective customers across the government and told ProPublica that the Defense Department was the \u201cone making the most demands.\u201d Concerned about the company\u2019s global workforce, officials there asked him who from Microsoft would be \u201cbehind the curtain\u201d working on the cloud. Given the department\u2019s citizenship requirements, the officials raised the possibility of Microsoft \u201chiring a bunch of U.S. citizens to maintain the federal cloud\u201d directly, Crowley told ProPublica. For Microsoft, the suggestion was a nonstarter, Crowley said, because the increased labor costs of implementing it broadly would make a cloud transition prohibitively expensive for the government.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always a balance between cost and level of effort and expertise,\u201d he told ProPublica. \u201cSo you find what\u2019s good enough.\u201d Hiring virtual escorts to supervise Microsoft\u2019s foreign workforce emerged as \u201cthe path of least resistance,\u201d Crowley said.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft did not respond to ProPublica\u2019s questions about Crowley\u2019s account.</p>\n\n<p>When he brought the concept back to Microsoft, colleagues had mixed reactions. Tom Keane, then the corporate vice president for Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform, Azure, embraced the idea, according to a former employee involved in the discussions, as it would allow the company to scale up. But that former employee, who was involved in cybersecurity strategy, told ProPublica they opposed the concept, viewing it as too risky from a security perspective. Both Keane and Crowley dismissed the concerns, said the former employee, who left the company before the escort concept was deployed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPeople who got in the way of scaling up did not stay,\u201d the former employee told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>Crowley said he did not recall the discussion. Keane did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>On its march to becoming one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, Microsoft has repeatedly prioritized corporate profit over customer security, ProPublica has found. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/microsoft-solarwinds-golden-saml-data-breach-russian-hackers\">the news organization reported</a> that the tech giant ignored one of its own engineers when he repeatedly warned that a product flaw left the U.S. government exposed; state-sponsored Russian hackers later exploited that weakness in one of the largest cyberattacks in history. Microsoft has defended its decision not to address the flaw, saying that it received \u201cmultiple reviews\u201d and that the company weighs a variety of factors when making security decisions.</p>\n\nA Skills Gap From the Start\n<p>The idea of an escort wasn\u2019t novel. The <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final\">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>, which serves as the federal government\u2019s standards-setting body, had established recommendations on how IT maintenance should be performed on-site, such as in a restricted government office. \u201cMaintenance personnel that lack appropriate security clearances or are not U.S. citizens\u201d must be escorted and supervised by \u201capproved organizational personnel who are fully cleared, have appropriate access authorizations, and are technically qualified,\u201d the guidelines state.</p>\n\n<p>The government <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r4/upd3/final\">at the time</a> specified the intent of the recommendation: to deny \u201cindividuals who lack appropriate security clearances ... or who are not U.S. citizens, visual and electronic access to\u201d sensitive government information.</p>\n\n<p>But escorts in the cloud wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to meet that goal, given the gap in technical expertise between them and the Microsoft counterparts they would be taking direction from.</p>\n\n<p>That imbalance, though, was baked into the escorting model.</p>\n\n<p>Erickson, the former Microsoft engineer who worked on the model, told ProPublica that escorts are \u201csomewhat technically proficient,\u201d but mainly are \u201cjust there to make sure the employees don\u2019t accidentally or intentionally view\u201d passwords, customer data or personally identifiable information. \u201cIf there are problems with the underlying\u201d cloud services, \u201cthen only the people who work on those services at Microsoft would have the requisite knowledge to fix it,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Advanced threats from foreign adversaries weren\u2019t on the radar for Erickson, who said he didn\u2019t \u201chave any reason to suspect someone more just based on their country of origin.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any extra threat from Microsoft employees based in other countries,\u201d he said.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n    \n            (Illustration by Andrea Wise/ProPublica. Source images: Bevan Goldswain/Getty Images, kontekbrothers/Getty Images, amgun/Getty Images.)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Pradeep Nair, a former Microsoft vice president who said he helped develop the concept from the start, said that the digital escort strategy allowed the company to \u201cgo to market faster,\u201d positioning it to win major federal cloud contracts. He said that escorts \u201ccomplete role-specific training before touching any production system\u201d and that a variety of safeguards including audit logs, the digital trail of system activity, could alert Microsoft or the government to potential problems. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cBecause these controls are stringent, residual risk is minimal,\u201d Nair said.</p>\n\n<p>But legal and cybersecurity experts say such assumptions ignored the massive cyber threat from China in particular. Around the time that Microsoft was developing its escort strategy, an attack attributed to Chinese state-sponsored hackers resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/us/office-of-personnel-management-hackers-got-data-of-millions.html\">largest breach</a> of U.S. government data up to that point. The theft initially targeted a government contractor and eventually compromised the personal information of <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/exclusive-25-million-affected-opm-hack-sources/story?id=32332731\">more than 22 million people</a>, most of them applicants for federal security clearances.</p>\n\n<p>Chinese laws allow government officials there to collect data \u201cas long as they\u2019re doing something that they\u2019ve deemed legitimate,\u201d said <a href=\"https://law.yale.edu/jeremy-l-daum\">Jeremy Daum, senior research fellow</a> at the Paul Tsai China Center at Yale Law School. Microsoft\u2019s China-based tech support for the U.S. government presents an opening for espionage, \u201cwhether it be putting someone who\u2019s already an intelligence professional into one of those jobs, or going to the people who are in the jobs and pumping them for information,\u201d Daum said. \u201cIt would be difficult for any Chinese citizen or company to meaningfully resist a direct request from security forces or law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Erickson acknowledged that having an escort doesn\u2019t prevent foreign developers \u201cfrom doing \u2018bad\u2019 things. It just allows for there to be a recording and a witness.\u201d He said if an escort suspects malicious activity, they will end the session and file an incident report to investigate further.</p>\n\n<p>How much of this information federal officials understood is unclear.</p>\n\n<p>A Microsoft spokesperson said the company described the digital escort model in the documents submitted to the government as part of cloud vendor authorization processes. However, it declined to provide those records or to tell ProPublica the exact language it used in them to describe the escort arrangement, citing the potential security risk of publicly disclosing it.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to a third-party auditor, Microsoft\u2019s documentation theoretically would have been reviewed by multiple parties in the government, including FedRAMP and DISA. DISA said the materials are \u201cnot releasable to the public.\u201d The General Services Administration, which houses FedRAMP, did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\nThe \u201cRight Eyes\u201d for the Job?\n<p>In June 2016, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/blog/government/2016/06/23/fedramp-confirms-high-compliance-status-microsoft-cloud-government/\">Microsoft announced that it had received FedRAMP authorization</a> to work with some of the government\u2019s most sensitive data. Matt Goodrich, then FedRAMP director, said at the time that the accreditation was \u201ca testament to Microsoft\u2019s ability to meet the government\u2019s rigorous security requirements.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Around the same time, Microsoft put the escort concept into practice, engaging contacts from defense giant Lockheed Martin to hire cloud escorts, two people involved in the contract told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>A project manager, who asked for anonymity to describe confidential discussions, told ProPublica that they were skeptical of the escort arrangement from the start and voiced those feelings to their Microsoft counterpart. The manager was especially concerned that the new hires would not have the \u201cright eyes\u201d for the job given the relatively low pay set by Microsoft, but the system went ahead anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Lockheed Martin referred questions to Leidos, a company that took over Lockheed\u2019s IT business following a merger in 2016. Leidos declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p>As Microsoft captured more of the government\u2019s business, the company turned to additional subcontractors, typically staffing companies, to hire more digital escorts. </p>\n\n<p>Analyzing profiles on LinkedIn, ProPublica identified at least two such firms: Insight Global and ASM Research, whose parent company is consulting giant Accenture. While the scope of each firm\u2019s business with Microsoft is unclear, ProPublica found more workers identifying themselves as digital escorts at Insight Global, many of them former military personnel, than at ASM. ASM and Accenture did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\nConcerns About China\n<p>Some Insight Global workers recognized the same problem as the former Lockheed manager: a mismatch in skills between the U.S.-based escorts and the Microsoft engineers they are supervising. The engineers might briefly describe the job to be completed \u2014 for instance, updating a firewall, installing an update to fix a bug or reviewing logs to troubleshoot a problem. Then, with limited inspection, the escort copies and pastes the engineer\u2019s commands into the federal cloud.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re telling nontechnical people very technical directions,\u201d the current Insight Global escort said, adding that the arrangement presents untold opportunities for hacking. As an example, they said the engineer could install an update allowing an outsider to access the network.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWill that get caught? Absolutely,\u201d the escort told ProPublica. \u201cWill that get caught before damage is done? No idea.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The escort was particularly concerned about the dozens of tickets a week filed by workers based in China. The attack targeting federal officials in 2023 \u2014 in which Chinese hackers stole 60,000 emails \u2014 underscored that fear.</p>\n\n<p>The federal Cyber Safety Review Board, which investigated the attack, blamed Microsoft for security lapses that gave hackers their opening. Its <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/CSRB-Review-Summer-2023-MEO-Intrusion\">published report</a> did not mention digital escorts, either as playing a role in the attack or as a risk to be mitigated. Sherman, the former chief information officer for the Defense Department, and Coker, the former intelligence official, who both also served as members of the CSRB, told ProPublica that they did not recall the board ever discussing digital escorting, which they said they now consider a major threat. The Trump administration has since disbanded the CSRB.</p>\n\n<p>In its statement, Microsoft said it expects escorts \u201cto perform a variety of technical tasks,\u201d which are outlined in its contracts with vendors. Insight Global said it evaluates prospective hires to ensure they have those skills and trains new employees on \u201call applicable security and compliance policies provided by Microsoft.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But the Insight Global employee told ProPublica the training regimen doesn\u2019t come close to bridging the knowledge gap. In addition, it is challenging for escorts to gain expertise on the job because the type of work they oversee varies widely. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to get as trained up as you need to be on the wide array of things you need to look at,\u201d they said. </p>\n\n<p>The escort said they repeatedly raised concerns about the knowledge gap to Microsoft, over several years and as recently as April, and to Insight Global\u2019s own attorneys. They said the digital escorts\u2019 relative inexperience \u2014 combined with Chinese laws that grant the country\u2019s officials broad authority to collect data \u2014 left U.S. government networks overly exposed. Microsoft repeatedly thanked the escort for raising the issues while Insight Global said it would take them under advisement, the escort said. It is unclear whether Microsoft or Insight Global took any steps to address them; neither company answered questions about the escort\u2019s account.</p>\n\n<p>In its statement, Microsoft said it meets regularly with its contractors \u201cto discuss operations and surface questions or concerns.\u201d The company also noted that it has additional layers of \u201csecurity and monitoring controls\u201d including \u201cautomated code reviews to quickly detect and prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMicrosoft assumes anyone that has access to production systems, regardless of location or role, can pose a risk to the system, whether intentionally or unintentionally,\u201d the company said in its statement.</p>\n\nAnother Warning, a Growing Risk\n<p>Last year, about three months after government investigators released <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/CSRB-Review-Summer-2023-MEO-Intrusion\">their report</a> on the 2023 hack into U.S. officials\u2019 emails, a former Insight Global contractor named Tom Schiller contacted a Defense Department hotline and wrote to several federal lawmakers to warn them about digital escorting. He had become familiar with the system while briefly working for the company as a software developer. By last July, Schiller\u2019s complaints wound their way to the Defense Information Systems Agency Office of the Inspector General. Schiller told ProPublica that the office conducted a sworn interview with him, and separately with three others connected to Insight Global. In August, the inspector general wrote to Schiller to say it had closed the case.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe conducted a preliminary analysis into the complaint and determined this matter is not within the avenue of redress by DISA IG and is best addressed by the appropriate DISA management,\u201d the assistant inspector general for investigations said in the letter. \u201cWe have referred the information you provided to management.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for the inspector general \u2014 whose office is supposed to operate independently in order to investigate potential waste, fraud and abuse \u2014 told ProPublica they were not authorized to speak about the issue and directed questions to DISA public affairs.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf the public information office contacts me and wants to collaborate to formulate a response through their office, I\u2019ll be more than happy to do that,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cBut I will not be responding to any kind of media request concerning OIG business without speaking with the public information office.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>DISA public affairs did not answer questions about the matter. After a spokesperson initially said that he couldn\u2019t find anyone who had heard of the escort concept, the agency later acknowledged in a statement to ProPublica that escorts are used \u201cin select unclassified environments\u201d at the Defense Department for \u201cadvanced problem diagnosis and resolution from industry subject matter experts.\u201d Echoing Microsoft\u2019s statement, it continued, \u201cExperts under escort supervision have no direct, hands-on access to government systems; but rather offer guidance and recommendations to authorized administrators who perform tasks.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It is unclear what, if any, discussions have taken place among Microsoft, Insight Global and DISA, or any other government agency, regarding digital escorts.</p>\n\n<p>But David Mihelcic, DISA\u2019s former chief technology officer, said any visibility into the Defense Department\u2019s network poses a \u201chuge risk.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHere you have one person you really don\u2019t trust because they\u2019re probably in the Chinese intelligence service, and the other person is not really capable,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>The risk may be getting more serious by the day, as U.S.-China relations worsen amid a simmering trade war \u2014 the type of conflict that <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/10/trade_war_reaches_cyberspace/\">experts say</a> could result in Chinese cyber retaliation.</p>\n\n<p>In testimony to a Senate committee in May, Microsoft President Brad Smith said the company is continually \u201cpushing Chinese out of agencies.\u201d He did not elaborate on how they got in, and Microsoft did not respond to follow-up questions on the remark.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>Today, after a post-9/11 era defined by global counterterrorism and asymmetric warfare, the U.S. is preparing for potential near-peer conflicts amid an era of great power competition that is complicated by disruptive technologies. In response, a new wave of defense contractors is emerging from the epicenter of American technological innovation: Silicon Valley. These companies are addressing critical technology gaps in areas such as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, space services, cyber operations, and small drones. They're deploying cutting-edge solutions to fill capability shortfalls that the U.S. government has acknowledged exist\u2014and they\u2019re scaling fast. Winning high-profile contracts, these companies are reshaping how the Pentagon engages with the private sector.</p><p>Among those in the defense tech industry, there\u2019s been growing chatter about the rise of these defense disruptors\u2014what you might call the <em><em>neoprimes</em></em>. We\u2014one of us a technology investor, the other a former portfolio manager at the Department of Defense\u2019s Defense Innovation Unit\u2014are often asked:<em><em> Is the rise of neoprimes real? What exactly is a neoprime? What defines one? </em></em>We set out to answer those questions, using data to support our observations. We believe neoprimes are changing the culture of defense acquisitions and developing technologies that will reshape how wars are fought. Shifts in defense spending and policy are empowering neoprimes to grow and move faster.</p><p>To understand how we got here, we can revisit a pivotal 1993 meeting now known as the \u201cLast Supper.\u201d Following the end of the Cold War, U.S. defense spending plummeted, prompting a major drawdown. The Department of Defense faced intense pressure to cut costs, with budgets falling by about 30%\u2014from, adjusted for inflation, $772 billion in 1989 to roughly $531 billion by 1998. Against this backdrop, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense William Perry convened a critical meeting, the \u201cLast Supper,\u201d with executives from the top defense contractors. His message was clear: the Pentagon could no longer sustain a sprawling ecosystem of dozens of major firms, and consolidation was inevitable. The industry responded accordingly\u2014over 50 companies merged into the five dominant primes we know today. These survivors\u2014Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics\u2014became massive, vertically integrated organizations that controlled roughly 60% of Department of Defense contracts by 2000. For decades, these primes dominated government contract spending to build and sustain the nation's security apparatus, supported by a vast web of partners and subcontractors. But with predictable, annual funding streams and limited competitive pressure, innovation within these primes arguably stagnated.</p><p><span></span>While many of these traditional primes trace their roots back over a century, a new tribe of Silicon Valley players has entered the arena. They are accelerating deployment timelines and pioneering a different model\u2014defined by rapid iteration, software-first architectures, and a greater appetite for risk. They're deploying operational systems in months rather than years or decades. They\u2019re not just building prototypes for demos and exercises\u2014they\u2019re scaling production and securing billion-dollar contracts. While they may not yet match the traditional primes in total contract volume, they are closing the gap year over year. A handful of key firms are leading the charge, with an expanding set of startups gaining traction. Backed by venture capital and supported by a growing network of influential advocates shaping policy and public opinion, neoprimes are starting to redefine how the government approaches the acquisition, fielding, and sustainment of new technologies. They are becoming mission-critical to the defense industrial base of America.</p><p>As this new generation of defense contractors gains momentum, what exactly is a neoprime? To answer that, we analyzed data from USAspending.gov (the federal government\u2019s official platform for tracking public expenditures), reviewed SEC filings from public defense companies, and compiled press releases from private firms. We also interviewed founders and venture capitalists focused on national security innovation.</p><p>Through this research, we identified several defining characteristics of neoprimes and emerging market trends. Our analysis focuses on a set of current neoprimes\u2014SpaceX, Palantir, and Anduril Industries\u2014alongside a cohort of rising companies like Shield AI, Skydio, Saildrone, Saronic, Hidden Level, Epirus, Relativity Space, Axiom Space, HawkEye 360, Vannevar Labs, and others. These companies are beginning to lead major defense programs with advanced technologies and a fundamentally different approach to speed, software integration, and delivery.</p><p>Below, we outline our findings and define the characteristics that distinguish neoprimes. We believe these companies represent the future of national security\u2014and to preserve America\u2019s strategic edge, we must rapidly adopt and scale their solutions across the defense industrial base.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Join us in Sea Island, Georgia for The Cipher Brief's </em><a href=\"https://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em>2025 Threat Conference</em></u></a><em> from October 19-22. See how you can save your seat at </em><a href=\"https://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em>tcbconference.com</em></u></a></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>Neoprimes are Racing Ahead in Department of Defense's Critical Technology Areas</strong></p><p>At their core, neoprimes are built around emerging, frontier technologies\u2014fields like AI and autonomy, integrated networks, biotechnology, and quantum science. In recent years, the Department of Defense has formally emphasized the importance of these technologies, identifying fourteen Critical Technology Areas that reflect a growing urgency to catch up with and surpass global competitors. </p><p>To better understand this trend, we evaluated the top five most commonly used Product Service Codes (PSCs) for a set of government contractors from 2018 to 2023. PSCs are used by the U.S. federal government to describe the products, services, and research being purchased through contracts, and we gathered this data from USAspending.gov\u2019s contract award summaries by vendor. For Palantir, SpaceX, and Anduril, we then identified the most popular PSCs across all three. We performed the same analysis to determine the top PSCs among the traditional defense primes\u2014Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics. </p><p>Palantir's top PSCs were predominantly in the information technology category, consistent with their core strength in data platforms and software integration. Most of the PSCs associated with Anduril were concentrated in engineering services. </p><p>In contrast, for traditional primes such as General Dynamics, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon, the most common PSCs were heavily concentrated in hardware categories\u2014covering items like airframe structural components, helicopter rotor blades, and shock absorbers. Compared to newer entrants, their portfolios featured far fewer PSCs related to software or IT services.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fa6d7\" src=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.png?id=61219053&amp;width=980\" /> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Neoprimes are also focused on interoperability. Traditional contractors are notorious for proprietary systems that require their own unique control systems and limited third-party integrations\u2014like drones that can only be operated with specific controllers, computers, or field kits. But proprietary everything doesn't scale on a battlefield increasingly filled with robots, sensors, and drones, especially as soldiers are limited by the number of control systems they can carry into the field. In contrast, neoprimes are designing software with interoperability in mind from the start\u2014built to integrate seamlessly with legacy systems and ingest any data the government allows.</p><p>Overall, the solutions neoprimes are developing are especially relevant today, as many Cold War-era tools are failing to scale to the demands of the modern battlefield. For example, Ukrainian soldiers are now using low-cost drones to disable expensive Russian platforms\u2014in the recent Spider's Web operation, 117 drones struck four Russian military airbases and targeted at least 40 warplanes. The operation dealt a significant asymmetric blow to the Russian military and broader economy, with estimated losses reaching up to $7 billion. The inevitable shift toward more affordable, more attritable platforms is forcing governments to rethink how they develop and fund major defense systems. Neoprimes and the Department of Defense are racing to develop low cost-to-kill technologies\u2014while also developing defenses against them\u2014as these small lethal platforms become increasingly common on modern battlefields around the world.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Sign up for the </strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>Cyber Initiatives Group</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

We have observed that these companies don't necessarily wait for the Department of Defense to fund their R&amp;D instead, they develop solutions they believe are obvious answers to current pressing problems and find ways to get them into the hands of warfighters\u2014often well before any large procurement orders have even been placed. </p><p>These companies will send prototypes \"downrange\" with willing servicemembers, sometimes years before more formal procurement contracts materialize. Shield AI, for example, deployed working prototypes of their AI-enabled drones to Special Operations Forces in combat in the Middle East, gaining critical feedback while also delivering real-world results for those early adopters. Other companies have taken similar approaches: deliver cutting-edge technology to warfighters first\u2014even before any formal requirement exists\u2014refine it in the field, and let the bureaucracy catch up later.</p><p>While we are encouraged by these bold efforts, we also recognize that rapidly deploying cutting-edge technology is not enough. What matters most is enabling and rewarding companies that deliver measurable impact on mission outcomes and operational effectiveness. We urge the Department of Defense to prioritize this focus across both traditional primes and neoprimes.</p><p><strong>Delivering On Time and Within Budget</strong></p><p>Neoprimes often prioritize outcomes over processes. For instance, Palantir was recently awarded a $178 million contract by the U.S. Army to develop the TITAN system, beating RTX Corporation in a competitive selection process. Remarkably, Palantir delivered the project on time and within budget\u2014traditionally a rare feat in defense contracting.</p><p>As one example of neoprimes' outcome-first approach, we have observed a growing preference for fixed-price contracts over the traditional cost-plus model. Under a fixed-price structure, companies are incentivized to innovate efficiently, as they are paid a set amount regardless of overruns. This stands in stark contrast to cost-plus contracts, where incumbents are reimbursed for all expenses and earn a profit margin on top\u2014removing much of the pressure to operate leanly.</p><p>When analyzing government spending data, we observed that nearly 100% of Palantir and SpaceX's contracts are fixed-price, while 65-80% of Anduril's contracts follow the same model. Among the traditional primes, General Dynamics has steadily secured an increasing number of fixed-price contracts, and the trend is less clear for others.</p><p>That said, both neoprimes and traditional contractors continue to rely on cost-plus contracts, as they remain the prevailing norm across much of the defense industry. We also recognize that ongoing debate surrounds the use of firm fixed-price versus cost-plus models in defense procurement. While advocates of fixed-price contracts view them as the most effective way for the government to ensure value and accountability, critics argue that fixed-price models can be too risky for complex scopes of work. A common argument in favor of cost-plus is that it provides the necessary flexibility when project requirements are uncertain or evolving.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"><br /></div> <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-90\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"10d7c\" src=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.png?id=61219438&amp;width=980\" /> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong><strong>Maximizing Revenue and Contract Value per Employee</strong></strong></p><p>Neoprimes operate with small, agile teams\u2014often with just a fraction of the headcount of traditional defense contractors. But what they lack in size, they make up for in velocity and output. Many of these companies are producing higher revenue or contract value per employee.</p><p>SpaceX and Anduril have outperformed several major traditional defense contractors in terms of obligations per employee, exceeding the ratios of Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics. And while Lockheed Martin has outperformed all in absolute terms, that may be attributed to its significantly larger revenue\u2014approximately $51 billion compared to SpaceX's $3.8 billion. </p><p>Note that because Anduril and SpaceX are still private companies, we based their employee counts on estimates from public reports. Palantir and all traditional primes report employee numbers in their SEC filings.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e1a8d\" src=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.png?id=61219057&amp;width=980\" /> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>Rising Use of OTAs in Defense Contracting</strong></p><p>While Palantir, SpaceX, and Anduril are leading neoprimes, several other companies are rapidly emerging in this category. Shield AI, which began with AI-powered quadcopters for U.S. Navy SEALs and other special operations forces, is now fielding its V-BAT unmanned aerial vehicle in Ukraine, Japan, and Brazil. Companies like Saildrone and Saronic are deploying a range of autonomous drones above and below the water. Cybersecurity leaders such as Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, and Crowdstrike are becoming key players in areas like trusted networks and digital defense. Commercial space companies like Varda, HawkEye 360, and Astranis are building capabilities for on-demand space access, persistent satellite coverage, and high-speed space-based data transfer.</p><p>With the rise of neoprimes, the Department of Defense has significantly increased its use of Other Transaction Agreements (OTAs) in recent years, reflecting a strategic shift toward more agile and flexible procurement methods. OTAs, which are not bound by the traditional Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), allow the Department of Defense to collaborate more easily with nontraditional contractors, including startups and research institutions. When properly executed, we believe that OTAs can lead to better, faster, cheaper outcomes for everyone involved\u2014saving time, money, and effort.</p><p>Further analysis shows that OTA usage is clearly trending upward within the Department of Defense. Even though OTA awards have increased significantly since 2017, however, they still account for only about 0.116% of the total contracts awarded by the Department of Defense\u2014it's still far from mainstream in the broad acquisition community. Given what OTAs have already delivered, we can only imagine the impact if more contracts were accelerated this way.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ff678\" src=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.png?id=61219059&amp;width=980\" /> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>The Road Ahead: Partnering with Neoprimes to Meet Emerging National Security Needs</strong></p><p>Today, we believe the U.S. government is beginning to recognize the strategic value of neoprimes in addressing critical capability gaps. The Department of Defense has acknowledged its lag in several key technology areas and has taken deliberate steps to close the gap. In addition to encouraging the services to expand their use of OTAs, the Department of Defense introduced the Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) framework to attract non-traditional vendors. It also launched the Office of Strategic Capital to provide more flexible financing options and created the National Security Innovation Capital initiative to support dual-use hardware development. Over the past two decades, the Department of Defense has invested more than $20 billion in small business initiatives\u2014all promising signs of progress, but more work remains. </p><p>Across the country, dozens of emerging technology companies are winning contracts that would have defaulted to traditional primes just a few years ago. These startups are not simply disrupting the defense industrial base; they are actively shaping the future of warfare. Their technologies are beginning to influence military doctrine, operational planning, and frontline tactics. </p><p>This shift reflects a broader transformation in national security priorities\u2014one we strongly support and believe must be accelerated. As these threats become increasingly software- and technology-driven, we\u2019re encouraged to see Silicon Valley and its neoprimes emerge as natural leaders in enabling the next generation of military readiness. Now is the time to double down.</p><p><em><em><strong>Editor's Note: The authors of this article are affiliated with Brave Capital and MVA (MilVet Angels), which have invested in national security companies like Anduril Industries, Shield AI, Aetherflux, Hermeus, Ursa Major, and others.</strong></em></em></p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

And more than three years after Putin launched his \u201cspecial military operation\u201d against Ukraine, Russia appears no closer to achieving its initial war aims than it was when the first troops paratroopers dropped into Kyiv.  </p><p>All of this begs the question: Whatever Putin\u2019s ambitions, can Russia pose a credible threat to the rest of Europe?   </p><p>\u201cTo launch a large-scale conventional armed incursion into a NATO country is not something Russia would want to do today,\u201d Kurt Volker, a former U.S. Ambassador to NATO, told <em><em>The Cipher Brief.</em></em> \u201cThey are bogged down in Ukraine. Their forces are not trained and equipped and capable where they want them to be.\u201d   </p><p>General Philip Breedlove (Ret.), a Cipher Brief expert who served as Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, describes \u201ctwo realities\u201d about the Russian threat.   </p><p>\u201cThe first reality is that Russia's army is really badly mauled and beaten up right now,\u201d said Breedlove. \u201cIt certainly is not ten feet tall, like we used to think. I jokingly say it's about five-foot five these days. So, over the next several years, in a land warfare context, Europe could do just fine.\u201d </p><p>But Gen. Breedlove says the second \u201creality\u201d is that Russia will work hard to rebuild its military might, that it has allies who will help, and that it has less conventional ways to threaten Europe in the meantime.   </p><p>\u201cIn many ways, Mr. Putin's running amok out there,\u201d he said, \u201cin the hybrid war, the below-the-line fight, whatever you want to call that war.\u201d   </p><p><strong>One view: A battered, beaten-down Russia</strong> </p><p>By almost any military or economic metric, Russia is in no position today to threaten other nations in Europe. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-june-12-2025\" target=\"_blank\"><u>estimates that Russia</u></a> has suffered between 900,000 and 1.3 million casualties since the 2022 invasion \u2013 including 350,000 troops killed in action. (By comparison, in the decade-long war in Afghanistan, the Soviets suffered roughly 50,000 dead and wounded.) <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/graphic-detail/2025/07/09/russias-summer-ukraine-offensive-looks-like-its-deadliest-so-far\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><em>The Economist</em></em></u></a> estimates that in Russia\u2019s current offensive, launched on May 1<u>,</u><span></span>31,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, for only snail-like advances.   </p><p>As for the <a href=\"https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/russias-economy-could-be-headed-for-collapse/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Russian economy</u></a>, the strains are evident in a growing budget deficit, falling oil revenues, and soaring interest rates. Last week, the main lending rate stood at a record 21%.   </p><p>Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges (Ret.), who served from 2014 to 2017 as the top U.S. Army Commander in Europe, said that given these realities, he has been surprised by Russia\u2019s staying power in Ukraine.   </p><p>\u201cRussia, I was certain, would not have made it this long,\u201d Hodges told <em><em>The Cipher Brief</em></em>, \u201cgiven the casualties that they have suffered, and the effects of some of the sanctions on them.\u201d  </p><p>Volker believes Russia\u2019s weaknesses \u2013 economic and military \u2013 are as profound as they have been at any other time during Putin\u2019s quarter century in charge.   </p><p>\u201cThey have lost a third of their strategic bombers,\u201d Volker said. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost a million people off the battlefield. They\u2019re having to replenish with recently conscripted untrained forces. And they're digging into storage to get World War II era equipment.\u201d</p><p>Ambassador Doug Lute, who \u2013 like Volker \u2013 served as U.S. Ambassador to NATO, said that \u201cPutin's army, which invaded Ukraine in 2022, largely does not exist today.\u201d</p><p>Lute notes that while Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion force was the product of a decade-long modernization ordered by Putin, Ukraine has succeeded \u2013 with on-and-off help from the West \u2013 in severely degrading those forces. Lute is among those experts who believe Russia will need a long time and fresh resources to truly threaten the rest of Europe.  </p><p>\u201cWe should remember that the last time Putin undertook such a modernization, it resulted in the force that failed in 2022,\u201d he said.  </p><p>Others aren\u2019t so sure. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

The Danish Defense Intelligence Service (DDIS) <a href=\"http://v/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>issued an analysis</u></a> of the Russian threat earlier this year, offering three scenarios \u2013 all of them starting with an end to the Ukraine war, and the assumption that Russia cannot currently wage war against multiple nations.   </p><p>Within six months of the guns going silent in Ukraine, the DDIS said, Russia would be able to wage a local war with a bordering country. In two years, it would have the capacity to launch a regional war in the Baltic Sea region. And within five years, it could launch a large-scale attack on Europe.  </p><p>\"Russia is likely to be more willing to use military force in a regional war against one or more European NATO countries if it perceives NATO as militarily weakened or politically divided,\" <a href=\"https://www.fe-ddis.dk/globalassets/fe/dokumenter/2025/trusselsvurderinger/-20250209_opdateret_vurdering_af_truslen_fra_rusland_mod--.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the report said</u></a>. \"This is particularly true if Russia assesses that the U.S. cannot or will not support the European NATO countries in a war with Russia.\"  </p><p>Germany\u2019s defense chief told the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62v63gl8rvo\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><em>BBC</em></em></u><u> last month</u></a> that Russia would be militarily ready to attack within four years \u2013 and perhaps sooner than that.  </p><p>\u201cIf you ask me now, is this a guarantee that's not earlier than 2029?\u201d General Carsten Breuer commented, \u201cI would say no, it's not. We must be able to fight tonight.\"   </p><p>In all these assessments, there are variables that would alter the calendar: the global price of oil \u2013 upon which Russia depends for revenue; the long-term loyalties of Russian allies, China in particular; and the mood of U.S. President Donald Trump, who is expressing frustration with Putin while offering more military aid to Ukraine.   </p><p>All those interviewed for this story made the point that robust and continued Western support for Ukraine \u2013 and sanctions against Russia \u2013 would prove critical in determining when Russia is truly able to menace other European nations.   </p><p>\u201cAll of this really turns on our credibility,\u201d Gen. Breedlove told us. \u201cI think Mr. Putin senses weakness and he knows what to do in the presence of weakness.\u201d   </p><p>Lt. Gen. Hodges said that the most important determinant of Russia\u2019s ability to threaten other nations in Europe will be how it ultimately fares in Ukraine.   </p><p>\u201cWhat I am sure of is that if Ukraine capitulates or fails, or if we turn our back on Ukraine and Russia is able then to take a couple of years to rebuild and fix what is broken, they will be knocking on the door of Moldova and on the door of Latvia or any other Baltic nation,\u201d Hodges said.   </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because their objective is to break the alliance, to show that NATO and its member nations are not really willing to fight against Russia over a piece of Estonia, for example, or a piece of Latvia. To make sure that the Russians never make that terrible miscalculation, we have to get back to where we were in the Cold War days, of spending what's necessary, of being prepared so that you can have another 40, 50 years of no war with Russia.\u201d  </p><p><em><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to </strong></em></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><em><strong>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</strong></em></em></u></a><em><em><strong> on YouTube?

    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/afghanistan-taliban-russia",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>In recent weeks, reports of Russia considering formal engagement and recognition of the Taliban have reignited debate around international approaches to the de facto rulers of Afghanistan.</p><p>But contrary to assumptions of ideological or strategic alignment, Moscow\u2019s overtures appear rooted more in fear than affinity.</p><p><strong>A Security-Driven Outreach</strong></p><p>Russia\u2019s posture toward the Taliban must be viewed through a regional security lens. In intelligence and counterterrorism circles, there is increasing alarm in Moscow over the surge in foreign extremist fighters now operating with impunity inside Afghanistan. Russia has long claimed that ISIS-K and affiliated groups enjoy covert support from Western intelligence services, a claim that is exaggerated but nonetheless fuels deep strategic paranoia within the Kremlin.</p><p>Recent intelligence reports indicate a notable uptick in foreign terrorist presence, particularly in northern and eastern provinces bordering Central Asia. Russia is concerned not just about Afghanistan\u2019s instability, but about its spillover potential into Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, all countries with fragile internal balances and historical ties to Moscow.</p><p>In this context, engagement with the Taliban is less about diplomatic recognition and more about gaining operational access, establishing surveillance footholds, and ensuring a minimal level of information-sharing. For Russia, the Taliban may be a tactical irritant, but foreign jihadist groups are a strategic threat.</p><p><strong>Taliban\u2019s Quest for Legitimacy</strong></p><p>From the Taliban\u2019s side, any engagement by major powers is quickly repackaged as de facto recognition\u2014a form of validation they desperately seek. Lacking internal legitimacy and having seized power through force, the Taliban views external recognition as a shortcut to international acceptance, regardless of the terms or the motives of the recognizing party.</p><p>Whether Russia\u2019s engagement is rooted in security fears or strategic containment is irrelevant to the Taliban; what matters is the optics. This dynamic creates a dangerous asymmetry, where tactical coordination by foreign states can be misrepresented as endorsement of Taliban governance.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

However, Beijing\u2019s interests in Afghanistan remain fundamentally different from Moscow\u2019s. For China, the overriding concern is the presence of Uyghur militants \u201cEast Turkistan Islamic Movement\u201d, many of whom have historically sought refuge in Afghanistan\u2019s east.</p><p>At the same time, China\u2019s strategic posture is fixated on its global rivalry with the United States, particularly in the domains of economic dominance and technological superiority\u2014most notably in artificial intelligence. Afghanistan, in this framework, is a peripheral concern. As long as Beijing can secure its western flank through covert financial leverage, trade access, and intelligence coordination, it has little incentive to formally recognize the Taliban. Such a move would carry diplomatic costs without any meaningful strategic return.</p><p><strong>A Word of Caution for the International Community</strong></p><p>While Russia and China may justify Taliban engagement based on narrow national security imperatives, these moves carry broader strategic and ethical risks. First, they undermine the international consensus that recognition must be contingent on inclusive governance, human rights, and counterterrorism compliance. Second, such recognition risks legitimizing radicalization and authoritarian consolidation through force, potentially emboldening similar movements elsewhere.</p><p>Finally, tactical engagement by states like Russia must be carefully managed to avoid the legitimization of Taliban rule, particularly in media narratives. Intelligence-sharing or backchannel coordination is a longstanding reality in conflict zones, but it must be explicitly framed as counterterrorism containment, not state-to-state diplomacy.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em><strong>Join us in Sea Island, Georgia for The Cipher Brief's </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>2025 Threat Conference</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> from October 19-22.

Afghanistan, under Taliban control, is rapidly becoming an ungoverned space\u2014one that external powers increasingly fear more than favor.</p><p>For the United States, these developments represent a critical inflection point. As global powers move from isolation to tactical engagement with the Taliban, Washington must lead in upholding the principle that recognition should never precede reform. Any diplomatic engagement\u2014whether multilateral or bilateral\u2014must be explicitly tied to measurable outcomes: meaningful counterterrorism cooperation, the protection of civil liberties, and inclusive political participation that reflects Afghanistan\u2019s ethnic and social diversity.</p><p>In the absence of such standards, the international community risks legitimizing a regime that has shown little intent to evolve\u2014and considerable capacity to destabilize.</p><p>At the same time, the United States should take a parallel step to support the formation of a legitimate political opposition to the Taliban\u2014one that represents the hopes of Afghans for a sovereign, democratic, and inclusive future. Working in coordination with international partners, Washington can help this coalition articulate a long-term political vision for the country. Though limited in scope, such a move would send a powerful message to Afghans inside and outside the country, to regional allies and adversaries alike, and even to the Taliban: that Afghanistan\u2019s future will not be defined by force alone. Most importantly, it would empower Afghans themselves particularly the new generation to lead the struggle for their nation's destiny.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

    "description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\u201cTo each there comes in their lifetime a special moment when they are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing\u2026\u201d</em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> \u2014 Winston S. Churchill</p><p><strong>OPINION</strong> -- Winston Churchill would have recognized the current situation in the U.S. relationship with Russia as a unique opportunity to make a mark on history. </p><p>Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin reaffirmed Moscow\u2019s war intentions in Ukraine, saying he considered Russians and Ukrainians to be one people and, \u201cin that sense the whole of Ukraine is ours.\u201d In the past two weeks, Putin has intensified Russia\u2019s drone and missile attacks across Ukraine putting heavy strain on Ukrainian air defenses. The Russian president is evidently of the view that Ukraine\u2019s defenses may be on the verge of collapse and that he can achieve his war ambitions through force.</p><p>Putin has cleverly played his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, whispering intentions of ending the war through negotiation and counting on Trump\u2019s desire for peace to push Ukraine into a deal that would essentially amount to surrender. But Putin has never once deviated from his maximalist goals in the war, in fact, he has only reaffirmed them at every opportunity. Russian participation in negotiations with Ukraine were quickly proven to be a form of \u2018maskirovka\u2019 (successful operations that mislead the enemy).</p><p>Now, Putin has intensified a bombing campaign clearly designed to target civilian infrastructure with the intent of both killing and demoralizing the Ukrainian people, and undermining support for the war and for the government in Kyiv.</p><p>Trump and his team seem to have finally arrived at the realization that they have been taken for a ride by Putin. The U.S. president recently characterized discussions with the Russian leader as \u201cmeaningless,\u201d saying, \u201cWe get a lot of bullsh*t thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth.\u201d (President Trump is not known for understatement. This may be the exception.)</p><p>Following his most recent call with Putin and a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump decided to resume sending some air defense interceptors and precision-guided bombs and missiles to Ukraine after last month\u2019s halt. This is a positive development but it is not enough. </p><p>Now is the critical moment to show strength, unity, and resolve to support the people of Ukraine. The U.S. President should not let himself be distracted by any suggestion relayed by Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov to Secretary of State Rubio after the two exchanged views on new ideas for Ukraine peace talks. (Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.)</p><p>The people of Ukraine understand better than anyone, the existential nature of Putin\u2019s aggression. They see what Russia is doing by kidnapping Ukrainian children and sending them to the territory of the Russian Federation. They see the elimination of Ukrainian language instruction in schools in areas Russia occupies. They see the dreadful, starved and tortured condition of Ukrainian soldiers who are returned in prisoner exchanges. For Ukraine, surrender or conquest means extermination. To end this, more military, economic and political assistance is required.</p><p>The decision by the U.S. to participate in the recent \u201cCoalition of the Willing\u201d meeting is another step in the right direction. U.S. participation sends an important message to our allies and to Putin. Trump should immediately take other actions to send Putin and the world a clear message of support for the victim in this conflict, Ukraine. </p><p>A good first step would be to support legislation sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal that targets Russia and countries that purchase Russian hydrocarbon products with stiff sanctions. The full range of available weapons systems should also be fast-tracked for delivery to Ukraine. Restrictions on their use in targeting military installations in the territory of the Russian Federation should be immediately removed. And high priority in that target set should be the factories that produce the Shahed drones that are now being used as weapons of terror against Ukrainian civilians.</p><p>President Trump should take a big picture view of the world Putin has created and the actual state of play of the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d that Putin has built. </p><p>In December of 2024, one of the key players in the Axis, former Syrian President Basher al Assad, saw his government collapse and he fled to exile in Moscow. Since October 2023, Israel has ruthlessly dismantled favored surrogates of the Axis, including Hamas and Hezbollah. The U.S. used military force to attack another favorite surrogate of Iran, the Houthis in Yemen. And in June, Israel conducted a number of stunningly effective attacks against Iran\u2019s nuclear program, military leadership, scientists, air defenses and other important targets. </p><p>Significantly, the U.S. joined Israel in conducting attacks against nuclear targets in Iran thereby demonstrating a commitment to use powerful elements of the U.S. military against a critical member of Putin\u2019s alliance. Note that all of these actions against Putin\u2019s axis received barely a peep from the great dictator in the Kremlin, much less a military response. Putin\u2019s axis is in serious trouble.</p><p>Russia\u2019s military is fully engaged in the fight against Ukraine, leaving Moscow with very little response. Estimates suggest that Russia has suffered a million casualties (killed, wounded, captured, missing) in the conflict thus far. All for the gain of a few hundred kilometers of Ukrainian territory. </p><p>The cost to Russia\u2019s economy has been similarly catastrophic. Inside his government, the mysterious deaths and suicides of regime officials and oligarchs\u2014even some considered to be Putin supporters - has got to be sending a message to those remaining - that no one is safe. The key piece in the puzzle that could bring Putin the fate he deserves is resolve from the U.S. President. </p><p>Ukraine was given just enough support not to lose against Russia under President Joe Biden, but never enough support to actually win and end this war. President Trump, you have the opportunity to show the world that you are the winning president.</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/4202494/remarks-by-secretary-of-defense-pete-hegseth-at-the-2025-shangri-la-dialogue-in/\" target=\"_blank\">warned recently</a> that an invasion \"could be imminent\", saying at a summit in Singapore at the end of May, that \"There's no reason to sugarcoat it: the threat China poses is real.\" The Defense Secretary also said that Beijing is \"credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific,\" adding, \"to be clear: any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world.\" Hegseth is not alone in believing that a Chinese invasion is inevitable as part of President Xi Jinping\u2019s plan to \u201cre-unify\u201d the island with mainland China. But it is also just part of a much broader strategy that long-term, poses significantly higher stakes.</p><p>As a result of the threat posed to U.S. national security, the CIA established the China Mission Center in 2021, with the aim of better coordinating the collection and analysis components of intelligence to better inform U.S. policymakers \u2013 and most importantly, the Agency\u2019s number one customer \u2013 the president of the United States \u2013 with the most accurate information possible about Xi Jingping\u2019s intent and timeline. Cipher Brief Expert Susan Miller, who retired from the CIA just a few months ago - where she served as the Assistant Director at the Center - told <em>The Cipher Brief</em> that Xi\u2019s intent is not only to forcefully reunify Taiwan. In fact, that\u2019s just the beginning.</p><p><strong>THE INTERVIEW</strong></p><p><em>Cipher Brief CEO & Publisher Suzanne Kelly talked with Miller about how U.S. intelligence is working to better understand what Xi is thinking. Our Subscriber+ interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><div class=\"expert-block-container expert-list\">\n<div class=\"expert-item\">\n<div class=\"expert-image\">\n<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/susan-miller\">\n<img alt=\"Susan Miller, Former Assistant Director of China Mission Center, CIA\" src=\"https://assets.rbl.ms/60329984/origin.jpg\" />\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"expert-description\">\n<h4 class=\"expert-name\">\n<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/susan-miller\">Susan Miller, Former Assistant Director of China Mission Center, CIA</a>\n</h4>\n<p class=\"expert-about\">\n        Miller spent 39 years at CIA as an operations officer, serving nine tours abroad, two as a Case Officer, one as Deputy Chief of Station and six tours as Chief of Station. She also served as assistant director of several mission centers at the Agency. \n      </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong></em><em><strong>What do you think it is that the American people need to understand about why China is posing a threat to U.S. national security and how they\u2019re doing it?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>He wants to absolutely replace the U.S. as the world leader, but he doesn't want to replace us as the world leader of democracy. He wants to replace us as the world influencer. He knows that we're going to go to war someday because he absolutely plans in the coming decade, if not in the shorter term, to invade Taiwan. And he absolutely knows that we would come to the defense of democracies around the world. So, in order to give him the edge, he has - not only in America but all around the globe - been able to get into national power grids. Just think, what could you do with that capability in a time of war? You turn off the power. We know he's in power grids in America and Europe and Africa and Asia.</p><p>Why? Because companies from the People\u2019s Republic of China underbid other companies. Now that ability is gone. That's something that the previous administration and the current administration both said, \u2018<em>we're not going to let anybody get at our current infrastructure\u2019</em>. But can you imagine if we decide to go to war to support Taiwan or we have to do it because something else has happened, can you imagine having no power in California or along the Eastern seaboard? And that's why we need to really care. And Xi Jinping\u2019s plan is to take us over bit by bit. There are some things that we have kind of let go, although we shouldn't have. One of them is that he has taken over U.S. influence in Africa and other developing countries.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> </strong><strong>China has certainly used its Belt and Road Initiative to moving into these areas and they're bringing money and they're bringing infrastructure and they're making day-to-day life better for the locals \u2013 at least in the short-term.</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Yes. They're doing what we used to do with USAID and with getting U.S. companies to kind of sign up and go do this, so that we could make sure we still get important minerals and so that we can make the widgets that we need to make from all of these countries. And then we also provide a platform where a democracy can at least start and maybe not ever be as robust as ours, but at least be better than what they have now. So, that's a real concern. China is stepping into a lot of these roles all over the world. And that bothers me because that should be us doing that.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> You\u2019ve also spent a lot of your professional career focused on the threat posed by Russia. Today, when you're comparing the China threat to the Russia threat, how are these threats different?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Can you name one thing you have ever bought that says Made in China? We all can, right? Have you ever even thought about buying a toaster oven made in Russia? The answer is no. And so I'm oversimplifying this a little bit because the bottom line is that with China, we have an integrated economic goal that might help them not want to go to war with us in a way that with Russia, we have nothing.</p><p>I lived in Moscow back in the Soviet days, and my American toaster broke so I went down to a department store and bought a Russian made toaster. I plugged it in and it caught fire the first time. And it is still like that. That's why they don't manufacture stuff. There are other things that they have there. They do have some minerals and some other things. They have a pretty good agriculture system that works not only for their own people, but for that area as well. But the bottom line is that Putin does not have the same kind of leverage over us as Xi Jinping has.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> He has nuclear deterrence, but he doesn't have economic deterrence. Everyone is watching to see what happens in the negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, the war that Russia clearly did start, clearly unprovoked. And as everyone follows the slow-moving headlines on this, I'm wondering if you think Vladimir Putin, who was a former spy himself, sees the world differently than a former businessman, which Donald Trump certainly has skills in the business world. But where do you see these two things potentially colliding in terms of how the U.S. needs to be approaching negotiating with someone like Putin?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Putin is not only a former intelligence guy from Russia. He also served as second chief directorate. And just to explain, first chief directorate spies, like CIA does, like MI6 does. You go overseas, you spot, assess, develop operations and things like that. The second chief directorate, they were the ones that put anybody who dared to say that the Soviet Union wasn't the best thing in the world into gulags. They also tortured people, dissidents, et cetera. And so he came from the nasty side of the KGB. And he's always been a believer in Russia having lost something under Yeltsin. And a guy like him - and there are a lot of them like him, just think of our version of white supremacists or white Nazi or American Nazis, things like that - that's their version. These are the people that support and work in the second chief directorate. So, that's the concern.</p><p>He doesn't care about human life. He doesn't care if his own people die in a war with Ukraine. He knows they're dying. And he knows that they're not making much progress and he's mad at his generals, but I can guarantee, in typical Russian \u2013 and I don't have absolute evidence of this because I don't have any exquisite intelligence on this - but he's probably underfunding them. They're probably not dressed well. There is still conscription going on there. And they're not that happy either. Whereas in Ukraine, they are fighting for their lives. And that, to me, is what is astounding Putin.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> The Cipher Brief has been briefed on reports from Ukrainians that captured Russian soldiers have relayed some of what they have been dealing with as are deployed to the front. A lot of them are reportedly untrained and in some cases, they reportedly didn't know who their commander was. So we know there's chaos within the ranks for sure. But we've seen something since the invasion of Ukraine that we hadn't seen on the world stage quite like this before, and that is this new friendship without any limits between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Does that concern you in a different way than these threats do on an individual basis?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>It does concern me, yes. It is concerning and it is different now that they claim they have this friendship without limits. But does any dictator really have a friend? Somebody they totally trust that they'll tell everything and vice versa? And if Xi Jinping says, \u2018<em>yes, of course I'll give you some some terrific bombs</em>,\u2019 and things like that, Xi also has to think about what kind of economic downturn is going to happen inside China if every country that sides with Ukraine - which is a lot of democracies around the world - says, \u2018<em>you know, we're going to start boycotting China\u2019</em>. That's one of the things he has to be extremely careful about.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> You stood up the China mission center for the CIA, which is something that didn\u2019t exist in this form prior. What do you think that should tell the American people about the importance of China and the importance of getting good intelligence on China?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>I was on my second tour in Israel when then-director [William] Burns came for a visit and during the long windy roads from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv, he mentioned that he had been talking with a China specialist at the agency and some others and said, \u2018<em>You know, I'm thinking we're not paying enough attention to China as the real strategic threat and even maybe a tactical one</em>\u2019, if you look at tactical being 10 years or less. And he said, \u2018<em>What do you think about that</em>?\u2019 I had been chief of East Asia division and chief in counter intelligence, and we had put Chinese spies behind bars. And I told him that we've been saying inside the agency for years, we are not paying enough attention to China. We were still dealing with remnants from 9/11 and Iraq and things like that, so I said, \u2018<em>I'm in\u2019</em>.</p><p>It took a while for us to figure it out and what we decided is that the China Mission Center owns property, that's going to be its own department. And so that's the China department basically, and Taiwan department at the agency. So that was one. Number two was we needed to look at the worldwide program. That's where we did the basically the external ops. And the goal was not only to work with stations - everything that we always do when we send out requirements - but we also needed to think about how we were going to do it a little bit differently so we had more success.</p><p>And so we started what we call STED, which is the Strategic Training and Education Department, which is kind of like TED talks, and they actually do a STED talk. And they're the ones that went out to every single mission center chief and built modules that really helped. So, that was the other thing that we did that was very different.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> A fascinating breakdown of how the intelligence community is prioritizing China as an intelligence target.</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em><em> </em></strong><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</strong></em></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>More countries aspire to be nuclear-weapons states, and we should prepare for this eventuality. That\u2019s why the Golden Dome missile defense initiative is timely and needed.</p><p>The war in Ukraine is a stark reminder that Ukraine giving up their nuclear weapons, pursuant to the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, in exchange for so-called security assurances, was a grave mistake. Indeed, If Ukraine retained any portion of its 1,900 nuclear warheads, would Russia have invaded Ukraine in 2014 and 2022 and risked a nuclear confrontation? Even a revanchist Vladimir Putin would have thought twice about the consequences of a nuclear war with Ukraine.</p><p>The 1968 Treaty on the non-proliferations of nuclear weapons (NPT) has been relatively effective in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology as the then-five nuclear-weapons states \u2013 the U.S. Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom \u2013 pursued nuclear disarmament. Over the years, however, Pakistan, India and North Korea have conducted nuclear tests and are now nuclear-weapons states, with Israel not acknowledging that they have nuclear weapons. North Korea was the only country to pull out of the NPT; the others never joined.</p><p>China refuses to enter any nuclear disarmament negotiations with the U.S. and Russia, while exponentially enhancing its nuclear-weapons arsenal. Since the failed Hanoi Summit in 2019, North Korea has raced to build more nuclear weapons and ballistic missile to deliver these weapons, to include a solid fuel Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) capable of targeting the whole of the U.S.</p><p>The U.S. and Israel just bombed Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow, given that Iran was enriching uranium at 60% purity, weeks away from the 90% purity for nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) May 31 report that stated Iran was in breach of its non-proliferation obligations and was denying monitors access to suspect nuclear sites reportedly contributed to the decision to bomb these sites.</p><p>Iran just announced that they were suspending cooperation with the IAEA until the safety of its nuclear facilities could be guaranteed.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

There\u2019s also a sense in Japan that eventually they also will need their own nuclear weapons, as a deterrent to North Korea and possibly China. The tension in the South and East China Seas and China\u2019s attempted intimidation of Taiwan are issues that will affect both Japan and South Korea. And indeed, an emboldened North Korea, now aligned with a revanchist Russian Federation, with a mutual defense treaty and North Korean troops in Russia participating in the war of aggression in Ukraine and receiving missile, satellite and nuclear support from Russia, may strike out at South Korea, in a conflict that could escalate quickly, to include the use of tactical nuclear weapons. Other countries in East Asia may feel compelled to also seek nuclear weapons, as a deterrent to any aggressor.</p><p>The same applies to the Middle East. Iran has been clear: They will continue to enrich uranium, despite the recent bombing of their nuclear facilities. But as a threshold nuclear weapons state, weeks away from fabricating nuclear weapons, calling for the annihilation of Israel, will there be a repeat of the U.S. and Israeli bombings? Will Iran now race to acquire nuclear weapons, especially now, given the removal of IAEA monitors?</p><p>Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey are very concerned about Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. Indeed, they may also feel a need to have their own nuclear weapons arsenal, for deterrent purposes. Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan publicly spoke about the unfairness of Turkey not having nuclear weapons as a deterrent given the precarious geopolitical situation in the region.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><em>Sign up today</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p>Our missile defense capabilities have lagged behind the advances in nuclear-weapons technology, especially the lethality of today\u2019s nuclear weapons that are eighty times more powerful than the atomic bombs used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p><p>There are currently over 13,000 nuclear weapons in the global stockpile of nuclear weapons, down from over 60,000 nuclear weapons during the Cold War. The New START arms control treaty between the U.S. and the Russian Federation, responsible for this reduction in nuclear weapons, expires on February 5, 2026, and Russia has refused to engage substantively on a successor to New START. So, what follows is uncertainty.</p><p>What is certain is that China will continue to build more nuclear weapons, with Beijing estimated to have over 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030; and North Korea, currently estimated to have over 50 nuclear warheads, is determined to build more nuclear weapons; and Iran is determined to remain a threshold nuclear-weapons state, weeks away from having nuclear weapons.</p><p>If South Korea and Japan and others in East Asia and if Saudi Arabia and Turkey and others in the Middle East decide to go nuclear, the global stockpile of nuclear weapons will increase exponentially. We also know that terrorist organizations, like Al-Qaeda, previously attempted to buy a nuclear weapon or radiological materials for a dirty bomb. And there may be countries willing to sell these weapons and radiological materials, or unable to securely store these weapons and materials that, then, are acquired by a rogue state or terrorist organization.</p><p>These are just some of the reasons why a Golden Dome <sub></sub>missile defense system is needed. Deploying space-based sensors and interceptors is no longer the Star Wars (Strategic Defense Initiative) that President Reagan pursued in 1983. We now have the technology and a budget of $175 billion to establish a viable missile defense capability hopefully within three years. We owe the American people security from the threat of a bad actor using nuclear weapons to attack the U.S.</p><p><em><strong>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/9/golden-dome-missile-defense-essential-americas-survival/\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Times</a></strong></em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business</strong></em><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>FINE PRINT / OPINION \u2014 </strong>\u201cThis report explores the environmental effects and societal and economic consequences that would be expected to follow in the weeks-to-decades after a nuclear war. The exploration begins\u2026with the consideration of four plausible scenarios for the employment of nuclear weapons, along with description of the immediate effects of the energy release and blast from a nuclear detonation.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s an excerpt from Chapter 2 of a new congressionally-mandated study from the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) entitled, <em><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/independent-study-on-potential-environmental-effects-of-nuclear-war\" target=\"_blank\">Potential Environmental Effects of Nuclear War</a></em></em>, that was released online June 25.</p><p>Because I have written extensively about nuclear weapons, including in my 2021 book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/403ad3K\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Blown To Hell</em>,</a> which is about radioactive fallout on the Marshall Islanders from the Bikini thermonuclear Bravo test in 1954, I was surprised to read <span style=\"background-color: initial;\">that \u201cevaluation of radioactive fallout was not included in the scope of the work.\u201d That apparently was because so much had already been published about the impact of radiation and radioactivity from nuclear weapons.</span></p><p>This new NAS study focuses primarily on the release of thermal energy (heat) from a nuclear explosion in the lower atmosphere, as well as kinetic energy (blast) and the air shockwave caused by the latter. A nuclear detonation in the atmosphere, where the fireball does not hit the ground, releases some 35 percent of its energy in heat; another 50 percent in blast and shock wave, and the remaining 15 percent of energy in radiation.</p><p>Nonetheless, I believe the study is worth exploring, if only, for example, to see the \u201cfour plausible scenarios\u201d the expert writers see that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. In addition, studies such as these often disclose facts not normally available.</p><p>There were a series of scientific studies in the 1980s that raised concern about large-scale nuclear exchanges leading to \u201cnuclear winter\u201d scenarios. They showed that nearly every country in the world would be affected, beyond those in conflict. In those studies, nuclear use by superpowers caused immense firestorms whose light-blocking soot and particulates reduced sunlight to disrupt worldwide agriculture and ecosystems for years.</p><p>I believe reminders such as that make all such studies valuable, because they can reduce the likelihood of any nuclear weapon use. The authors of this new study apparently feel that way since they wrote, \u201cWith growing risks of nuclear proliferation and evolving warfare doctrines, this renewed scientific examination aims to quantify the grave global stakes should such hostilities occur in the current and future security environments.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Sign up for the </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Cyber Initiatives Group</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

They are the United Kingdom with an estimated 225 weapons; France with 290; India with 160; Pakistan with 170; China with 500 and growing; and North Korea with 50.</p><p>I must point out here that the NAS has omitted Israel, which has some 90 or more nuclear weapons, according to experts such as Hans Kristensen and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The U.S. Government and apparently the NAS follow Israeli policy of ambiguity, neither confirming nor denying their nuclear weapons exist, although they have had them since the late-1960s. Israel even has sub-launched, nuclear-tipped cruise missiles as well as nuclear bombs and land-based missiles.</p><p>In its study, the NAS presents what it describes as four plausible scenarios for nuclear weapon use:</p><p>Large-scale strategic usage of 2,000 warheads, where the scenario is that the Russia/U.S. nuclear exchanges begin at the tactical level, but escalate to the strategic level;</p><p>Moderate-scale strategic exchange of 400 warheads, where the scenario is a China/U.S. conflict;</p><p>Small-scale regional conflict of 150 warheads, such as one between Pakistan and India;</p><p>Very small-scale use of a single warhead, to \u201cdemonstrate resolve\u201d and \u201ca willingness to employ nuclear weapons.\u201d This scenario seems to follow the Russian strategy of \u201cescalate to de-escalate,\u201d that initially appeared in the past decade.</p><p>The NAS study says it has proposed these scenarios in order \u201cto study potential environmental inputs,\u201d though the study also \u201crecommends further development of a more comprehensive set of scenarios.\u201d</p><p>I should point out that I have been told that in U.S. military wargaming, when the scenario leads to one side using a nuclear weapon and escalation begins, the game usually ends because no one is prepared to say where nuclear exchanges are going or how to stop them.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

But the study notes that \u201cwhile some military targets are likely in or near urban areas, present-day [nuclear] weapons are generally more accurate and are of lower yields, which would likely reduce the impact on civilian structures.\u201d</p><p>Hiroshima, the Japanese target for the first U.S. atomic bomb, was described in a 1945 pre-attack U.S. government document put together by Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s Target Committee as \u201can important depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged.\u201d</p><p>The point was then, and I believe it remains now, that any decision to use a nuclear weapon is in recognition that its use would destroy property and kill many people, both military and civilian. Remember, some 70,000 people were killed at Hiroshima with thousands more dying later from effects of that one atomic bomb.</p><p>The NAS study points out, \u201cFollowing a nuclear blast [totaling one megaton], there are two surface-temperature pulses and two pulses of thermal radiation from the fireball.\u201d The first thermal pulse lasts just one-tenth of a second but is \u201ccapable of permanent or temporary effects on the eyes.\u201d</p><p>The second thermal pulse may last up to ten seconds and \u201ccarries about 99 percent of total thermal radiation energy\u2026 This radiation is the main cause of skin burns up to 12 miles or more away, and of eye effects at even greater distance. The radiation from the second pulse can also cause fires to start under suitable conditions.\u201d There was a firestorm at Hiroshima.</p><p>When it comes to the blast effect from nuclear weapons, the NAS study says, \u201cMost thermal radiation reaches material in advance of the blast wave,\u201d something that is not generally understood. The study adds, \u201cThe blast can extinguish flames, but can also leave smoldering material and rubble which can grow into larger fires. Blast waves can cause damage that results in secondary ignitions, thus being an additional source of fire starts.\u201d</p><p>Within the city limits of Hiroshima, 92 percent of all buildings were destroyed or damaged. Of that number, 63 percent were completely destroyed by fire, with only 5 percent completely destroyed only by blast.</p><p>The NAS study describes agriculture and food production as among the economic consequences of nuclear weapon usage, saying there \u201ccan be extensive direct and indirect impacts\u2026with far-reaching consequences for immediate and long-term food security.\u201d</p><p>In one of several radiation mentions, the NAS study says, \u201cRadioactive fallout, pollution, and habitat destruction could contribute to the decline of various plant and animal species, disrupting ecosystem services crucial for maintaining soil fertility, pest control and ecosystem health. This could further challenge agricultural systems to recover and adapt to the new post-war conditions.\u201d</p><p>I saw first-hand in the Marshall Islands in the 1970s that decades after being subjected to radioactive fallout from a powerful thermonuclear weapon ground-burst more than 100 miles away, plants grown on land and shellfish from the sea still showed radioactivity that made them dangerous to eat.</p><p>There is a footnote in the NAS study scenarios section that mentions so-called countervalue nuclear targets, which it describes as \u201ccivilian and cultural targets, population centers and infrastructure.\u201d In other words, they are urban or suburban civilian-populated areas.</p><p>That footnote adds: \u201cIn some sense, countervalue targets can be understood to be punitive or for revenge; however, these terms are currently considered out-dated and inappropriate with current U.S. nuclear strategy.\u201d</p><p>As I noted earlier, Oppenheimer and his Target Committee saw their massively powerful atomic bombs as devices to end a war, not fight one. In my terms, in 1945 they understood that their new nuclear bombs were terror weapons, designed to show how many buildings could be destroyed and people killed with a single bomb.</p><p>And I believe now, however one talks about nuclear weapons and no matter the number they have, they remain today terror weapons \u2014 and that is what deters their use today \u2013 at least against a nation that has its own nuclear weapons or is allied with such a nation.</p><p><em><strong><em>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

A growing sense of urgency is quietly emerging.</p><p>China\u2019s preparation for a potential invasion is no longer a distant possibility but a reality rapidly coming into focus \u2014and defense planners are grappling with a pressing question: how and when will Washington act?</p><p>\u201cTaiwan is incredibly reliant upon U.S. support for both deterrence against China, as well as a war-fighting invasion scenario,\u201d Kitsch Liao, associate director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global China Hub, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThe U.S. is the sole arms supplier for Taiwan because China has coerced every other country into not selling Taiwan any weapons.\u201d</p><p>Taiwan, a democratic and technologically vital island of 24 million people, faces increasing military, economic, and political pressure from Beijing.

Yet most experts agree on one thing: an invasion is no longer a question of \u201cif\u201d but \u201cwhen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had to give a range, I\u2019d say possibly between 2032 and 2040,\u201d Alexander Huang, Special Advisor to the Chairman and Director of International Affairs for the opposition KMT, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThere\u2019s this unscientific estimate floating around that Xi might want to accomplish something \u2018big\u2019 before turning 80. That makes the next decade a period to observe.\u201d</p><p>Even if a full-scale invasion is delayed, Taiwan still faces near-term risks, including cyberattacks, blockades, disinformation, and surprise strikes.</p><p>\u201cA war with Taiwan would not be localized. Missiles would likely hit Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines,\u201d Scott Huang, a researcher at Taiwan\u2019s National Science and Technology Council, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThese countries would get involved. That\u2019s why China has been hesitant to initiate real war.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

As Liao points out, \u201cChina observes no rules and offers no restrictions in conducting influence and espionage operations against the Taiwanese public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are talking about everything from ostensibly religious organization exchanges, charity support, to funneling illegal campaign contributions, and utilizing local Mafia for blackmail and potential assassinations,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe CCP United Front and espionage effort has been able to increase existing societal contradictions, such as Taiwan\u2019s ever-difficult identity issues, driving wedges into political issues, and convincing the Taiwanese population that they cannot possibly fight the Chinese.\u201d</p><p>Beijing has been <a href=\"https://techinformed.com/china-readies-for-cyber-attack-against-taiwan/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">using</a> cyberwarfare and information operations against Taiwan\u2019s population ahead of any potential military action. With Taiwan\u2019s strategic location and its centrality in the global supply chain\u2014especially in semiconductors\u2014China understands that victory does not need to come solely through kinetic means.</p><p><strong>Semiconductors and Strategic Leverage</strong></p><p>For Washington, the stakes are immense. Taiwan\u2019s TSMC <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-makes-the-majority-of-the-worlds-computer-chips-now-its-running-out-of-electricity/#:~:text=Along%20the%20way%2C%20Hsinchu%20Science,world's%20most%20advanced%20computer%20chips.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">manufactures</a> approximately 90 percent of the world\u2019s advanced semiconductors, powering AI, military systems, and the global economy. Washington has been trying to change that.</p><p>TSMC\u2019s decision, made <a href=\"https://www.tsmc.com/static/abouttsmcaz/index.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than</a> five years ago, to build fabrication plants in the United States\u2014most notably a $40 billion investment in Arizona\u2014has been hailed as a move to bolster supply chain security and reduce dependence on East Asia. The project includes two advanced chip facilities in Phoenix, one of which is expected to manufacture cutting-edge 3-nanometer chips by 2026.</p><p>But Chen\u2019s comments reflect a deeper strategic reality: the most advanced nodes of chip manufacturing, engineering talent, and supply chain infrastructure remain deeply entrenched in Taiwan. The Arizona expansion may provide redundancy, but some experts believe it cannot fully replace the island\u2019s dominant role in global chip production. For Beijing, that leverage adds to the strategic calculus. For Washington, it highlights why Taiwan\u2019s security is inextricably linked to America\u2019s economic and national security interests.</p><p>\u201cSemiconductors are Taiwan\u2019s major strategic asset. But whether the recent investment in Arizona was TSMC\u2019s idea or happened under U.S. pressure is unclear,\u201d Liang-Chih Evans Chen, an associate research fellow at Taiwan\u2019s Institute for National Defense and Security Research, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt could be seen as Taiwan trying to spread its risk by diversifying manufacturing. That\u2019s a reasonable strategy, but it\u2019s not realistic to completely move TSMC out of Taiwan.\u201d</p><p>Beyond economics, the Taiwan Strait is also a maritime artery.</p><p>\u201cAbout 80 percent of ships in Asia pass through the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Shen notes. \u201cTaiwan also produces key technology components, like chips, that power global industries. A conflict would impact housing prices and economies worldwide.\u201d</p><p><strong>America\u2019s Unfinished Playbook</strong></p><p>Despite lacking formal diplomatic ties or a defense treaty with Taiwan, the U.S. remains the island\u2019s primary arms supplier and strategic partner. While President Trump\u2019s current remarks favor ambiguity\u2014he\u2019s declined to specify if he\u2019d defend Taiwan. His administration approved major arms sales to Taiwan and oversaw the highest-level U.S. visit in decades. The mixed signals complicate planning, but signal continuity in support.</p><p>Five months ago, the State Department quietly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/china-taiwan-us-state-department\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">removed</a> language that distanced the U.S. from supporting an independent Taiwan. In March, the G7 issued a firm rebuke of China\u2019s coercive tactics toward Taiwan, omitting the \u201cOne China\u201d language for the first time.</p><p>Vice President J.D. Vance has called China the \u201cbiggest threat\u201d to Washington. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth recently <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0uauGCYMRw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a> that \u201cthe threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent.\u201d</p><p>Still, ambiguity persists at the highest levels. Trump has declined to specify whether he would defend Taiwan, <a href=\"https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stating</a>, \u201cI don\u2019t want to ever put myself in that position.\u201d He has also said, \u201cTaiwan should pay us for defense.\u201d</p><p>Internal divisions and a slow-moving bureaucracy continue to be critical challenges.</p><p> \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a confirmed Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia. Same with the Pentagon\u2019s Indo-Pacific Security Affairs post. That leaves a massive vacuum in communication,\u201d stressed Alexander Huang. \u201cThere\u2019s no alliance treaty, no joint exercises, no shared doctrine, no direct communication network. How can they help?

China\u2019s military dwarfs it, with an estimated two to three million personnel and theater commands focused on Taiwan.</p><p>\u201cAlthough they wouldn\u2019t mobilize their entire force, they have specific theater commands focused on Taiwan\u2026 and China could easily redirect forces from other regions if needed,\u201d observed Chen.</p><p>Taiwan is rapidly investing in submarines, drones, and advanced U.S.-made fighter jets. Yet delivery delays and domestic political gridlock complicate readiness.</p><p>\u201cDespite being eager to purchase more American arms, Taipei has struggled to receive its purchases in a timely fashion\u2014harming long-term readiness,\u201d Jack Burnham, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>.</p><p>A $6 billion defense budget cut by the KMT-majority legislature earlier this year further strained capabilities, experts lamented, <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202507010030#:~:text=The%20president%20then%20shifted%20focus,social%20media%20post%20Tuesday%20night.\" target=\"_blank\">prompting</a> pressure from President Lai for the frozen funds to be \u201cunfrozen\u201d in June. Still, the waiting game has many on edge.</p><p>\u201cThe first indigenous submarine was supposed to undergo trials this October, but it\u2019s already behind schedule,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWith budget cuts, we don\u2019t know what will happen with submarines two and three.\u201d</p><p>Experts also warn that most civilians remain unprepared for large-scale conflict.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re prepared in the same way we turn on Netflix every night and say, \u2018Oh, poor people in Ukraine or Gaza\u2014but not us!\u2019\u201d Alexander Huang points out. \u201cWe think we\u2019re the chosen ones, living on a beautiful island.\u201d</p><p>Should China act, Taiwan will require resupply from the U.S.\u2014missiles, fuel, medical kits, and more. Escorting convoys, running blockades, and challenging Chinese air superiority will almost certainly demand U.S. military intervention. Analysts underscore that the time for preparation is narrowing.</p><p>\u201cDuring an invasion scenario, Taiwan will eventually require resupply for everything from missiles to critical medical supplies,\u201d Liao surmises. \u201cEscorting such supply convoys and running a Chinese blockade would require U.S. intervention. There are very few scenarios where Taiwan can win alone.\u201d</p><p>But experts agree that if Taiwan falls, the global consequences will be felt far beyond the Taiwan Strait.</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

We must respond accordingly.</p><p><strong>Raising Standards through Transparency and Accountability</strong></p><p>The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) currently mandates high cyber defense standards for corporate members of the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). The new Trump team should extend this standard-setting practice, partnering with the insurance industry to establish high standards for America\u2019s private critical infrastructure operators.</p><p>The insurance industry would leverage its experience with cyber incident data from hundreds of thousands of cyber incidents to help government set these minimum standards across sectors and functions within sectors. </p><p>The government would require operators to establish Cybersecurity Information Centers (CICs) to audit organizational standards compliance, report their results to the government, and inform the management of their internal cyber security posture.</p><p>In much the same way that U.S. public companies are required to report financial results following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the CIC reporting standard would provide the government and insurers important visibility into operator risk and provide operators a standardized framework for cyber risk management. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Join us in Sea Island, Georgia for The Cipher Brief's </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>2025 Threat Conference</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> from October 19-22.

The water utility\u2019s CIC would continuously monitor its cyber risks against the sector\u2019s ground truth. The water operator, the government, and insurance companies would be informed of whether the utility complies and how well it performs compared to other operators. </p><p>Through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), industry regulators, and potential reinsurance vehicles, the government would work with the insurance industry to mandate compliance or the water utility would be denied cyber insurance coverage. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Sign up for the </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Cyber Initiatives Group</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT Q&amp;A \u2014 </strong><em><em>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in Washington D.C. on Monday to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House \u2014 their third meeting this year. Netanyahu\u2019s visit follows the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran last month. Two items are at the top of Trump\u2019s agenda for the meeting: a ceasefire deal on Gaza, and a nuclear deal with Iran.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Before Netanyahu touched down in the U.S., The Cipher Brief spoke with Ambassador Gary Grappo, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Oman and Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, to discuss the dynamics and outcomes he is on the lookout for at the Trump-Netanyahu meeting. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. You can watch the full discussion on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaxOCtsvOjE\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief YouTube Channel</a>.</em></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>What are you going to be looking for as this meeting unfolds?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>The last time the president and Mr. Netanyahu met, it was very much a Trump-dominated visit. They had a public event in which Mr. Netanyahu shockingly spoke very, very little and even seemed a bit submissive. I'll be interested to see how that dynamic plays out in this visit. I expect it to be very, very different. And secondly, looking at the actual specifics, what comes out of this, what they discuss, what are the issues that they focus on and address, the circumstances of this visit, of course, are very, different from Mr. Netanyahu's previous visits to the White House since Trump took office. </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>We know President Trump is very much interested in a deal on the war in Gaza, and also vis-a-vis Iran. It does seem that Prime Minister Netanyahu may be a little less eager. Let's talk about Gaza first. The U.S. hasn't had much success in this administration or the Biden administration before it in pressuring or using its leverage against Israel to get any changes in terms of the prosecution of that war. Do you think it's a different circumstance now?</p><p> <em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>It is a different circumstance. Certainly the dynamic in Gaza has changed very, very little since the last time they met. The Israelis unquestionably hold the upper hand. They literally control between 60-70 percent of the territory of Gaza. They're continuing their efforts to root out Hamas throughout the territory, as challenging as that is now since they're more dispersed, deeply hidden and it's requiring that the IDF to employ different tactics than they may have earlier on in the war.</p><p>But what has really changed is Iran and what has taken place in Iran over the course of the last month to six weeks, with Iran now greatly weakened. Its threat in terms of its nuclear weapons is much diminished thanks primarily to the efforts of the Israelis, but also to the United States and specifically the decision of Donald Trump to enter the war as he did with the dropping of those bunker buster bombs. So there'll be a bit of a good feeling coming out of that, and deservedly so for both sides. And that is going to factor in, I think, into the conversation they have about Gaza.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>Is it essentially that Trump may feel the U.S. did what Israel had been asking us to do for some time with those bunker busters against Iran, and now we'd like Israel to come to the table and push the Gaza deal over the line, assuming, of course, that Hamas is OK with some of those final provisions? Is that the game here?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>That\u2019s certainly one factor here. Donald Trump did jump into a fray that he initially was very reluctant to join \u2014 he had said so publicly before Israel started its first series of attacks on Iran earlier in June. There\u2019ll be something of that in Donald Trump's conversation with Bibi, but also the fact that now with the great danger tamed in Iran, Bibi has much more room for maneuver, including from right-wing members who have threatened to leave his coalition unless he followed a pretty hard-line approach to Gaza, but also Iran. They may be less of a threat now, given the fact that the threat from Iran has diminished.</p><p>And there's a third factor here, and Donald Trump has hinted to this in the last week to 10 days, and that is the charges hanging over Bibi Netanyahu's head. Donald Trump has intimated making a statement that these charges should be dismissed. Mr. Trump is very, very popular in Israel, and if he's making statements like this, which is inserting himself into the judicial process in Israel in a very direct way, it can have a very telling effect on Netanyahu's right wing \u2014 even if they threaten to leave, Mr. Netanyahu may stand a better chance in any elections which might result from the collapse of his coalition.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Apply for a seat at the table today.</em></strong></em></u></a></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>Let's go to Iran. Donald Trump would love what he would consider a good deal with Iran. Netanyahu and that right flank, not so much.</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>No, not at all. Trump very, very much fears getting drawn into another Middle East war and to allow the Israelis to press the advantage, which they may very well do even without the United States. There\u2019s the fear that once again, the Americans may be drawn into the conflict, particularly given the likelihood that the Iranians are going to move to expedite the development of their weapons program, whatever its current state may be. And there seems to still be some question about how much of the more highly enriched uranium they have, how many centrifuges they may still have and where they are located, which could require another American intervention. And I think Trump is fearful of that.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>The question of the Trump administration's leverage is interesting. I was struck by the fact that during that period when a ceasefire was first agreed to, to end this recent 12-day campaign in Iran, there was a moment when President Trump took to social media to say to the Israelis, stop those bombers. It does seem like at least for the short term, he'd like the Israelis to lay low, right?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>Absolutely. Don't forget Mr. Trump has his right wing to answer to as well. It was known from the outset that some of his more hardline supporters were very much opposed to the American intervention in Iran and still are despite the obvious success of the American involvement. They really would like to see us close the book on our intervention there because they also see a real danger of the Americans being further entrapped, they would say, in another Middle East war if the Israelis decide, as you say, to press the advantage.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>We spoke soon after President Trump had announced his arrangement under which the U.S. would take control in Gaza. Whatever happened to that?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>It has been forgotten, but I think it's been put on the shelf, which in fact has become a library of plans for settling the Israeli-Palestinian dispute that never get implemented. I just don't see it as a possibility. What we're currently discussing is a ceasefire, and there are some signs that Hamas may be taking it a little more seriously than they have previously. The Israelis have indicated their willingness to accept it, although I'm sure there are some caveats. But what the administration would like to see is the ceasefire go into effect with assurances provided by the United States that negotiations for a permanent end to the conflict would continue during this 60-day period. And I'm not sure the Israelis are prepared to agree to that. I'll have to see. I'm sure that'll be a discussion point when they meet.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

They do not want to see a continuation of an active conflict in Iran. So they will be hoping that the president can keep the lid on that.</p><p>And then secondly, for Mr. Trump, [the normalization of Israeli-Saudi ties] still remains his ace in the hole. This is something that Bibi Netanyahu very, very much wants to have \u2014 it would be a signature achievement, but that's going to require an acceptable solution to the war in Gaza. And so that's an ace in the hole for Trump if he decides to play it, if he has spoken at all with the Saudis about this possibility. They have previously indicated their hesitancy to enter into any normalization talks without a clear path toward a Palestinian state. They might be willing to accept some general verbiage around that point without necessarily committing to a Palestinian state in terms of a time frame. But they very much want to see an end to this war and a change in the predicament of the Palestinian people of Gaza who still remain suffering, huddled up in a very, very small area with food shortages, even famine and starvation in some areas. A massive humanitarian effort is going to be necessary.</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> on YouTube?

Netanyahu continues to push a no-holds-barred war in Gaza and an uncompromising position on Iran and its nuclear program; Donald Trump is looking to make deals on both fronts.</p><p>Publicly, Trump and Netanyahu will no doubt cheer the success of recent strikes against Iran and the coordination that was evident between the two nations during that 12-day war. In the wake of those attacks, Trump offered to negotiate with Iran, and he has repeatedly urged Israel and Hamas to accept what he calls a \u201cfinal proposal\u201d for a Gaza truce. </p><p>These are the latest in a series of efforts the President has made to make peace on the global stage. As a candidate, Trump promised quick solutions to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and since his second inaugural, he has expended significant diplomatic efforts on Iran and global trade disputes as well. And other than a few trade agreements, he has made no major deals as yet. Might the Netanyahu visit change that? </p><p>Experts say the hurdles involve domestic pressures on the Israeli Prime Minister, who has shown little interest in deals that don\u2019t suit the right-wing nationalists in his government.</p><p>\u201cFor Netanyahu, there are domestic political concerns that are influencing his enthusiasm about proceeding with a ceasefire [in Gaza] or formal negotiations with Iran,\u201d Jason Campbell, Senior Fellow at The Middle East Institute, told The Cipher Brief. \u201cI think that will continue to be a flashpoint in his discussions with President Trump.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Ambassador Gary Grappo, whose diplomatic career included high-level postings in Oman, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, said that Trump\u2019s decision to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2013 something Netanyahu clearly wanted the U.S. to do \u2013 may help him press the Israeli leader to halt his campaign in Gaza.</p><p>\u201cDonald Trump jumped into a fray that initially he was very reluctant to join, and had said so publicly before Israel started its first series of attacks on Iran,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. He expects Trump to use that \u201cbig favor to Israel,\u201d as he called it, in his discussions with Netanyahu. </p><p><strong>A rare rift</strong></p><p>Although President Trump has boasted frequently of his close relationship to Israel \u2013 the country \u201chas never had a better friend in the White House,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/8/trump-tells-jewish-americans-he-is-israels-best-friend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a> during his first term. But he has stymied Netanyahu several times since his return to office. </p><p>The last time the Israeli Prime Minister came to the White House, Trump refused to give him a green light for attacking Iran, and just days before Israel\u2019s strikes last month, he <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/trump-told-netanyahu-not-strike-iran-nuclear\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said publicly</a> that such attacks would be \u201cinappropriate.\u201d </p><p>Earlier this year, Netanyahu <a href=\"https://jweekly.com/2025/05/07/us-announces-truce-with-houthis-without-telling-israel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">was reportedly furious</a> to learn that the Trump administration had negotiated directly with Hamas to free U.S. hostages, and that the White House had ended its campaign against Houthi militants without informing Israel. It didn\u2019t help matters that when Trump took his four-day visit to the Middle East in May, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mideast-trump-israel-diplomacy-saudi-syria-gaza-5d20c749f79b3e5c7b78def1d6588334\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he chose</a> to leave Israel off the itinerary.</p><p>After that trip, former White House Middle East adviser Dennis Ross<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/trumps-gulf-tour-the-money-deals-the-diplomacy-and-what-comes-next\" target=\"_self\"> told The Cipher Brief</a> that \u201cthe Israelis are learning that President Trump is going to do what he decides is in our interests \u2013 we've seen a pattern recently of, \u2018We'll do what we want, and it doesn't necessarily mean we feel their interests have to be taken into account.\u2019\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a rupture of the relationship, Ross said, but it was highly unusual for a self-proclaimed \u201cbest friend\u201d of Israel. </p><p>The June 22 U.S. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts-assess-strikes-response-and-what-comes-next\" target=\"_self\">bunker-buster strikes</a> \u2013 which some referred to as a \u201cfavor\u201d to Israel \u2013 appear to have swung the U.S.-Israel pendulum back in a more favorable direction. <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-thanks-trump-for-support-tells-iranians-your-liberation-from-tyranny-is-closer-than-ever/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netanyahu said</a> as much last week, thanking Trump for his \u201csteadfast stance\u201d on Iran and his overall support of Israel. \u201cI thank him for his consistent support of our country,\u201d he said.</p><p><strong>Deal or no deal, part one: The Gaza war</strong></p><p>Since the strikes against Iran, Trump has been pressing Netanyahu hard \u2013 demanding almost, that he finalize a proposed 60-day ceasefire deal with Hamas. </p><p>This week, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-07-02-2025-111a1cf968318cb0fb6d9865a3ac84dc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump wrote</a> on social media that Israel had \u201cagreed to the necessary conditions to finalize\u201d the ceasefire, \u201cduring which time we will work with all parties to end the War.\u201d The<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-negotiations.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> outlines of the deal</a> include the release of the hostages \u2013 there are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-hostages-released-76f4aef0816546f5048ca881bcd32e4b\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">about 50</a> remaining in Gaza, and authorities believe fewer than half of them are still be alive.

Israel would pull back troops from Gaza, and negotiations would continue over those 60 days to bring about the end of the war.</p><p>Hamas says it is weighing the proposal.

I don't think that's what Netanyahu would want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is some distance between the positions of Mr. Trump and the Israeli government, including Mr. Netanyahu, on Iran,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cAnd don't forget Mr. Trump has his right wing to answer to as well. It was known from the outset that some of his more hardline supporters were very much opposed to the American intervention in Iran and still are\u2026They also see a real danger of the Americans being further entrapped in another Middle East war if the Israelis decide to press the advantage.\u201d</p><p><strong>The Saudi factor \u2013 and the Gaza \u201cRiviera\u201d</strong></p><p>Beyond Gaza and Iran, President Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d Middle East deal involves another major power in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia. Trump\u2019s singular foreign policy achievement during his first term was the so-called Abraham Accords, which produced peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. And he has made clear his wish to bring Saudi Arabia into those agreements.</p><p>The Biden administration was pursuing a Saudi-Israeli rapprochement as well, but all progress on that front ended abruptly with the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and the war on Gaza that followed. Saudi Arabia has insisted on a peace deal in Gaza and a plan for a Palestinian state as prerequisites for entering into any deal with the Israelis. Trump would love to be seen as the architect of this new and potentially critical piece of the Abraham Accords, and certainly the Israelis would love to see it happen. </p><p>\u201cFor Mr. Trump, this still remains his ace in the hole,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cIt's something that Bibi Netanyahu very, very much wants to have. It would be a signature achievement to have normalization of Israeli-Saudi ties, but that's going to require an acceptable solution to the war in Gaza. And so that's an ace in the hole for Trump if he decides to play it.\u201d</p><p>One thing is clear, as Netanyahu heads for Washington: Trump\u2019s last big plan for Gaza \u2013 the idea that the U.S. would take over the territory and create a real-estate bonanza on the \u201cRiviera\u201d \u2013 is no longer in the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI think it's been forgotten,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cOr at least it's been put on the shelf, and that shelf has over the years, become a library of plans for settling the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>It pays to be a Subscriber+Member.

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION --</strong> The United States is facing a quiet and rapidly growing threat across the digital landscape, an unseen mathematical space of binary code and shadowy actors. This landscape demands more, not less, attention, and urgently, if the U.S. is to win the strategic competition of this generation.</p><p>The most sophisticated and ambitious of our adversaries is the government of the People's Republic of China in Beijing, which is pursuing an aggressive national strategy to undermine America's digital future.</p><p>More than 20 years have passed since the last major reorganization of the U.S. intelligence community. In that time, the adversarial threat landscape has changed dramatically, and technology has become central to the intelligence mission. With ever-increasing demands being placed on the Intelligence Community (IC) in a time of fiscal constraint, it is right to ask whether it is optimized for the emerging threats of tomorrow. It is not.</p><p>Given these stakes, lawmakers and national security leaders debating the most significant reforms since 2004 face a critical choice: focus on the real challenges posed by China's digital strategy or become mired in bureaucratic reshuffling.</p><p>The current debate in Washington, focused on the Intelligence Community Efficiency and Effectiveness Act of 2025, exemplifies this risk. It proposes substantial cuts and a restructuring of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which has indeed grown beyond its envisioned size and narrow mission. While ODNI's future size and structure merit discussion, that topic should not distract policymakers with arguments over bureaucratic power, resources, and prestige while missing the bigger, more urgent picture.</p><p>The true measure of reform should not be judged by organizational charts, which rarely impact mission success. The core issues are aligning skills and resources with our most pressing challenges, eliminating bureaucracy that fails to contribute meaningfully to the mission, and unleashing American innovation. Importantly, it is also the candid acknowledgment that espionage demands audacity, agility and risk in the field and in the technical ops center, the so-called pointy end of the spear. Yet institutional incentives often discourage the calculated risks essential to effective intelligence work, creating structural barriers to the bold action required in today's digital intelligence mission.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em></em></p><p>A central challenge faced by the IC is the PRC's aggressive national digital strategy, which explicitly aims for global dominance in artificial intelligence by 2030. Beijing views AI as critical infrastructure for national security and geopolitical influence, backing it with extensive state investment and a military-civil fusion program to weaponize civilian technology. To effectively counter this, the U.S. IC must achieve and maintain dominance in all digital domains where China's advancements are most pronounced.</p><p>Cyber Collection and Defense: China increasingly leverages AI-driven automation to conduct sophisticated cyber espionage, systematically compromising critical U.S. infrastructure, intellectual property, and defense-related information. Yet our current cyber capabilities are hampered by antiquated acquisition processes that treat software like hardware, sometimes taking years to field capabilities that adversaries deploy on rapid timelines.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence: Beijing uses powerful AI algorithms to analyze vast datasets, including the personal and biometric data of Americans, to significantly enhance the precision and scale of its espionage. Meanwhile, IC agencies struggle with bureaucratic barriers that prevent rapid adoption of commercial AI tools and make it difficult to partner with smaller tech companies who are leading innovation in this space.</p><p>Strategic Data Acquisition: China's comprehensive data strategy treats information as a strategic asset, harvesting it from commercial, governmental, and individual sources to fuel its AI systems. Naturally, the IC\u2019s ability to leverage open-source data is limited by its available budget, but this is an area worthy of modest additional investment to benefit the mission of all IC members.</p><p>Information Operations: Chinese state actors utilize generative AI tools, including advanced deepfakes and social media manipulation, to propagate disinformation, deepen societal divisions, and reshape the global digital landscape to align with China's objectives. The IC must quickly improve its ability to identify and counter such efforts at scale and at machine speed, which will require investment in sophisticated technical capabilities now, not someday.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Upgrade your access to exclusive content by <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\">becoming a subscriber</a>.</strong> </em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Real reform demands breaking and rebuilding an outdated acquisitions process designed for analog-era weapon systems. Consider this reality: while China can deploy new cyber capabilities on rapid timelines, the IC can take up to two years to procure and field comparable digital tools due to processes designed for a bygone analog era. Creating fast-track authorities means establishing dedicated pathways where software and digital services can be evaluated, tested, and deployed within weeks rather than following traditional procurement timelines. This also requires a concerted effort to drive genuine partnerships between government and private industry, the true engines of innovation, by creating new pathways for tech talent to serve short tours in government and streamlining how the IC adopts commercial technology.</p><p>Critics rightfully worry that rapid acquisition could compromise security or oversight. The solution is not slower processes, but smarter ones that leverage new AI capabilities by creating streamlined security reviews specifically designed for software, implementing continuous monitoring instead of front-loaded approvals (the one-and-done approach), and building accountability mechanisms that match the speed of digital threats.</p><p>The goal of intelligence reform should be clear: promote a culture of bold risk-taking, eliminate bureaucracy where it merely perpetuates itself, ruthlessly drive efficiency to free up precious resources, and reallocate those resources to the challenges of the future rather than the structures of the past. This requires immediate action from Congress to establish new acquisition authorities, from IC leadership to restructure internal processes, and from the private sector to engage more deeply with national security missions.</p><p>It would be a mistake to squander precious time in debates over bureaucratic power while our adversaries move forward aggressively. The United States must match and surpass their speed, innovation, and audacity, focusing exclusively on the real challenges ahead to secure America's digital future.

U.S. forces are deemed potential targets of retaliation and one U.S. airbase in Qatar did come under attack, albeit a largely symbolic one.</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Cipher Brief spoke with General Frank McKenzie (Ret.), who oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East as the head of U.S. Central Command from 2019 to 2022, about the mission and vulnerability of U.S. troops in the region, and what might happen if they were to leave. Our interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>The Iraq War is long over. The United States - in a coalition - defeated ISIS some time ago. The Afghan War is over. What is the mission or are the missions of all those troops that remain in the Middle East?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie: </em></strong></em>I would argue that the fight against ISIS still goes on. We don't actually fight that fight ourselves, but we do support our partners both in Iraq and in Syria who continue to conduct operations against ISIS, which is now newly flourishing based on the turmoil in Syria. That may correct itself over the next few months with the new government, which I think is a good thing. So we're still in that fight a little bit. But to your basic question, our forces are there to train our partners in the region, to work with them, to provide assurance of American presence, and that's largely focused on Iran. Iran remains a singular threat in the region, and we've seen over the last few months, why we need to be very aware and alert to the threat from Iran.</p><p>The other thing is that while we do have a lot of forces in the region, they are distributed. We defended ourselves very effectively against an Iranian attack a few days ago. And forces also provide assurance to our neighbors while they deter action by our potential opponents. Our friends in the region can't leave. They're stuck there, so the fact that U.S. forces are there actually adds to their level of assurance that we'll be a reliable partner should Iran attack them.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>A good many of those American troops are there at the invitation, if not the request, of some of the Gulf states. That's of course not the case for different reasons in Iraq and Syria. To what extent is the U.S. presence, in your view, an answer to those kinds of requests? And to what extent is it strategically smart for the United States?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie:</em></strong></em> It\u2019s a combination of both. It certainly serves our interest to maintain a presence in the region. It certainly serves the interests of the Gulf States and other states that we be there in order to give them additional stability as they confront the threat from Iran. So I think it serves both our interests. We\u2019re actually in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government now. I think we have an ongoing negotiation process with the Iraqis about what our force posture is going to be. So we're in Iraq because the Iraqis want us to be there, not because we're forcing ourselves on the Iraqis.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

We could leave the region, and that's talked about fairly frequently. If we left the region and drew down dramatically, then that assurance component would go away and they would also be, as an effective operational matter, far more vulnerable to attacks from Iran. We've seen how willing Iran is to actually use their military to attack their neighbors over the last few months. That's the thing to cover when we look at why our forces are there: what effects do we derive? Assurance and deterrence against Iranian attacks. </p><p>I think those are all useful things because that keeps the flow of commerce through the region, moving through the Strait of Hormuz. We've reopened the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait recently. I believe commerce is eventually going to flow again, though that's going to take a little time as insurance companies test the waters about what the Houthis are going to be willing to do. But all of those things are very much in our national interest.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>Let's talk about the vulnerability of some of those forces. You've had all those forces under your command. How difficult a task is it to go from whatever the baseline force protection is to us now attacking the nation of Iran? What's the ramp up like in terms of security?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie:</em></strong></em> We have exquisitely rehearsed and prepared plans to protect our forces. As the CENTCOM commander, you begin every day worrying about the force protection level of U.S. forces in the region, our embassies in the region, our American citizens in the region, as well as our friends and partners. So you look at that every day and you balance it against what the Iranians are doing. We have very good ways of knowing what the Iranians are thinking about and what they plan to do. So as we saw recently, we are typically able to adjust and prepare for that. The risk is always that you'll get it wrong or they'll get lucky, and we know and understand that. But we work very closely with forces in the region to ensure they're prepared for these types of things. It's a battle drill. It is an onerous thing to do. You're leaving the comfortable places you live. You're going to places that are certainly less comfortable, albeit for a short period of time, but it's one of the best ways we can effectively save the Iranians from themselves. If they were to attack us and cause significant U.S. casualties, then the potential for upward escalation is very high. We always say the Iranians own the lower steps on the escalation ladder. We own all the higher steps on the escalation ladder. Every CENTCOM commander spends a lot of time looking at that.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

You may not need as much as you've got right now. You need the ability to flow them back in very quickly if you elect to pull forces out. But what we have right now is an Iran that is effectively deterred. They chose not to launch a massive attack on us. Instead, they launched a very choreographed attack, and if we're to believe reporting, that was telegraphed well in advance because they did not want to get into significant combat with the United States \u2014 because they know and understand our capabilities. That's what these forces bring. To draw down precipitously would possibly undo that deterrent effect.</p><p>On the other hand, and this is something that really only the president of the United States can balance, he's a president who has struck Iran twice \u2014 [Quds Force Commander, General] <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/avenging-the-death-of-qassem-soleimani\" target=\"_self\"><u>Qassem Soleimani</u></a> back in 2020, and now this most recent attack. President Trump possesses extraordinary credibility with the Iranians because he's taken bold action two times, which puts him in a unique position that no other American president has had going back several administrations. </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em>D</em><em>o you think that President Trump might have some success in bringing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a place that looks more like a ceasefire in Gaza and a deal in Iran?</em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie: </em></strong></em>Short answer is, I don't know. I do know that we and Israel both share the same objective with Iran. We don't want them to have a nuclear weapon, and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of discussion on that, a lot of assessment. How effective were the strikes? Where are we? What needs to be done? I would assume they're going to spend a fair amount of time talking about that. But I would also say the same thing I said about President Trump and Iran. That same credibility probably extends to his relationship with Israel and the way going forward. So I'll watch with great interest to see what comes out of those meetings next week.</p><p><em><strong><em>Are you Subscribed to </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> on YouTube?

McKenzie said. \u201cAnd it certainly serves the interests of the Gulf states and other states as well that we be there in order to give them additional stability as they confront the threat from Iran.\u201d</p><p>The focus on the U.S. presence in the Middle East comes early on in an administration that has indicated it may want to pivot from a focus on the region and shift attention toward Asia. But testifying just prior to the U.S. attack in Iran, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, who was <a href=\"https://defensescoop.com/2025/06/30/combatant-commanders-centcom-eucom-brad-cooper-alexus-grynkewich/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed just this week</a> as the new CENTCOM commander, said he sees no reason to draw down now. </p><p>\u201cOur approach today is to assess and move forward on a conditions-based assessment,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he told</a> the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cI think, given the dynamic nature of what's happening today, that assessment in the future could look different than it does today, perhaps, and if confirmed, I'm committed into my tenure to continue to assess what our posture needs to look like and make recommendations.\u201d</p><p><strong>What are U.S. Troops Doing There</strong></p><p>For decades, the United States has kept tens of thousands of military personnel in the Middle East, spread across bases from Syria to the Persian Gulf. </p><p>Among the largest are the <a href=\"https://greydynamics.com/al-udeid-air-base-the-largest-us-military-installation-in-middle-east/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Al -Udeid Air Base</a> in Qatar, home to the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing and the forward headquarters of CENTCOM \u2013 with some 10,000 troops \u2013 and the U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet base <a href=\"https://installations.militaryonesource.mil/in-depth-overview/naval-support-activity-bahrain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in Bahrain</a>, where 9,000 Americans are deployed. 13,500 U.S. service members are stationed at <a href=\"http://v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bases in Kuwait</a> and another 5,000 in the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/12/mapping-us-troops-and-military-bases-in-the-middle-east\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">United Arab Emirates (UAE).</a> Maritime deployments that followed the Hamas massacre in Israel on October 7, 2023, added a few thousand troops to the overall number. Finally, roughly 3,000 Americans are stationed at bases in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/after-iran-proxy-strikes-should-u-s-troops-leave-iraq-and-syria\" target=\"_self\">Iraq and Syria,</a> vestiges of the anti-ISIS operations that were carried out a decade ago. </p><p>Proponents of the current force posture see a smart distribution of troops that matches U.S. interests and furthers several key missions: the ability to respond quickly to crises; countering the Iranian threat; bolstering the defense of Israel; helping secure maritime commerce in the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz; maintaining U.S. relations with key Gulf allies; and ensuring that ISIS and other groups do not reconstitute themselves and threaten U.S. interests. </p><p>\u201cThere are multiple missions at play,\u201d Cohen said, beyond the current operations against Iran. \u201cSome of this is a legacy of the global war on terrorism. We have soldiers in Syria and Iraq, doing primarily counter-ISIS missions, some stabilization missions as well. But we also have the major air bases in Bahrain for the Air Force and the Navy, managing air operations and the naval forces in the region. And what that means in practice, is we are concerned about the free flow of commerce through places like the Strait of Hormuz, and making sure that the Houthis don\u2019t interfere with global maritime traffic there as well.\u201d </p><p>Those arguing for a drawdown say that a force of 40,000 is far too costly, and that the stated missions are either outdated or could be accomplished with a much smaller number of troops. </p><p>\u201cMy longer-term view \u2013 even before the Iran strike \u2013 of the forces in the Middle East has been that when you have 40,000 forces in a region, anything that happens in that region implicates the United States, even things that actually aren't in U.S. interests,\u201d Kavanagh, the Defense Priorities director, told <em>The Cipher Brief.</em></p><p>\u201cTo the extent that we can get those forces out and limit unnecessary entanglements, I think that would be a smart move,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that doesn't necessarily mean that you could never operate in the Middle East if there were actually a threat. Air power and naval power is something that's very mobile, and if you had the support of the Gulf countries, you could operate from those bases again.\u201d</p><p><strong>The war against ISIS</strong></p><p>Officially, U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria serve as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, which began as a U.S.-led coalition in 2014 to dismantle the Islamic State (ISIS). Although that campaign was declared a success in Iraq (in 2017) and in Syria (2019), the U.S. maintains nearly 3,500 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/24/us-troops-attacked-syria-iraq-israel-hamas-gaza/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">troops</a> in the two countries. </p><p>Those bases are also considered the most vulnerable to outside attack, and well before the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes against Iran, analysts and policymakers were questioning the wisdom of keeping them there.</p><p>After Israel launched its war on Hamas in October 2023, these bases \u2013 along with a smaller outpost in Jordan \u2013 were attacked hundreds of times by rocket strikes that reportedly caused <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/40-us-service-members-may-brain-injuries-iran-linked-attacks-rcna123591\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dozens</a> of traumatic brain injuries among U.S. troops. In January 2024, three Americans <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/tower-22-and-the-path-to-a-wider-war\" target=\"_self\">were killed</a> and dozens were injured at the small \u201cTower 22\u201d base in Jordan. As <em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/tower-22-and-the-path-to-a-wider-war\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a></em> reported then, the deadly strike prompted calls for ending the Iraq and Syria deployments.</p><p>Bernard Hudson, a former director of counterterrorism at the CIA, told us then that U.S. troops in those countries were \u201cfolks in harm\u2019s way who can\u2019t be protected and are surrounded by Iranian elements in both countries.\u201d </p><p>Today, the case for staying in Syria and Iraq imagines a different nightmare: the Americans leave, and conditions are restored for a resurgent ISIS that could do more damage in the region and beyond. </p><p>\u201cI would argue that the fight against ISIS still goes on,\u201d Gen. McKenzie said. \u201cWe don't actually do that fight ourselves, but we do support our partners both in Iraq and in Syria who continue to conduct operations against ISIS, which is now newly flourishing based on the turmoil in Syria.\u201d </p><p>Cohen concurred. \u201cISIS is beaten down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not gone, though. And the concern is if you begin to take forces away, ISIS will sprout back up. There are also concerns that if we pull out, particularly out of Syria, we will risk abandoning the Kurds, who've been a long-time partner. So, there's an argument for keeping troops there for a host of both counterterrorism reasons, but also for regional stability issues.\u201d</p><p>Kavanagh countered that the threat to the U.S. was minimal, and not worth the investment in U.S. military force. </p><p>\u201cISIS is not a threat to the United States \u2013 at least not the ISIS that's operating in the Middle East,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people argue that ISIS-K is becoming a more global threat, but they're not in Iraq and Syria. And our intelligence community has been very effective at uncovering plots before they happen. So, I'm not convinced that you need a military presence to protect the United States from that threat.\u201d</p><p>The Defense Department has been conducting a \u201cposture review\u201d of the Iraq and Syria deployments for more than a year. The Iraq Higher Military Commission, which was tasked with preparing a U.S. withdrawal plan from that country, hasn\u2019t met since September, <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">according to <em>Defense One</em>.</a> Recently, Maine Senator Angus King returned from a visit to Iraq and said that officials there had asked for the American troops to remain. </p><p>\u201cThey have an election coming up this fall, and that's been one of the significant dangers,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sen. King said</a>, referring to potential threats from Iran-backed militias in Iraq. \u201cIt seems to me, given the renewed volatility\u2026it\u2019s not a good time to be drawing down our forces, because they are viewed as stabilizing forces in all of those countries in the Middle East.\u201c</p><p><strong>A rapid-reaction force \u2013 and the costs</strong></p><p>Many experts say that the brief war with Iran \u2013 and the tensions that linger in its aftermath \u2013 are only the latest examples of a longstanding reality: crises in the Middle East come with regularity. And that, they say, is reason enough for maintaining the American air and naval bases in the Gulf states. </p><p>Proponents of the U.S. posture also note that those Gulf allies want the Americans there. The U.S. has mutual defense agreements and commitments with Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain. An abrupt exit, they argue, could undermine relationships with those countries.</p><p>\u201cThere's a geopolitical bent here in that the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, they all value having a U.S. presence in the region,\u201d Jason Campbell, Senior Fellow at the Middle East Institute, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt provides them both a certain level of added security from Iran, as well as additional access for their respective militaries to training and certain types of equipment that are of use to them. So, there are both security and geopolitical reasons for the presence in this part of the world.\u201d</p><p>Detractors point to the costs \u2013 particularly of the larger bases in the Gulf. Sustaining U.S. forces in the Middle East is expensive, north of <a href=\"https://reason.com/2024/10/08/a-year-of-war-in-the-middle-east-cost-americans-nearly-23-billion/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">$20 billion</a> per year. Kavanagh and Caldwell argue that U.S. personnel in the region require more extensive defenses than those based at home, including hardened facilities and advanced air defenses, to protect them from Iranian-backed drone and missile attacks. </p><p>Meanwhile, each uptick in tensions has meant shifts to a high-alert status that carry their own costs. When the U.S. made the decision to strike Iran, most of the aircraft at the al-Udeid base in Qatar were moved out, and ships stationed at the U.S. naval base in Bahrain were sent out to sea as a security precaution. </p><p>\u201cThere is a heightened level of threat there,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThey'll move some of their naval ships out of Bahrain and out to sea to keep them safer\u2026These are typical things we see, leading up to and enduring periods of tension in the region.\u201d</p><p>Ultimately, none of those measures mattered much in the recent war; the Iranians were clearly not interested in escalation, and their public retaliation \u2013 for now at least \u2013 has been limited to a single well-telegraphed strike against the Al-Udeid base, which President Trump said had come with advance warning.</p><p>But Caldwell and Kavanagh argue that the costs and the vulnerability of these bases alone make the case for a drawdown, or at least a consolidation of U.S. forces in the region to one or two locations. </p><p>\u201cThe \u201812-Day War\u2019 fortunately did not cost any American lives,\u201d Caldwell and Kavanagh <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/28/iran-strike-american-military-vulnerability/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> in the Post, \u201cbut it highlighted our vulnerabilities in the region and underlined how our existing force posture was superfluous to achieving our aims. The war\u2019s end provides an opportunity for the United States to do what it has tried and failed to do for the better part of a decade: rationalize and downscale its presence in the Middle East.\u201d</p><p><strong>What comes next</strong> </p><p>All the past calls for a drawdown of American military power in the region ultimately ran into the same roadblock: It\u2019s hard to disengage from the Middle East. </p><p>President Donald Trump ran for a second term on a foreign policy platform that would decrease American involvement in the Middle East and pivot towards growing challenges in the Indo-Pacific. He referred to himself as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/10/trump-war-israel-gaza-ukraine-yemen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\u201ccandidate of peace,\u201d</a> with promises to extricate the U.S. from entanglements in the region. He may still do so; but like many of his predecessors, he has found it difficult to stay out of the region\u2019s turbulence.</p><p>\u201cI'm optimistic that once things stabilize, at least some of the air and naval power will move out of the region, because I do think there are strong voices in the Pentagon and elsewhere who really would like to concentrate more on Asia,\u201d Kavanagh said. \u201cAnd you can't do that when all your air and naval assets are tied up in the Middle East.\u201d</p><p>Even those experts who support the deployments say they welcome the discussions about their future.</p><p>\u201cThere's certainly debate to be had for the number of installations required,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHow many forces should indeed be there and what specific purpose should they serve? I think those are all fair questions, but again, the geopolitical costs of removing forces completely from the region could be higher than many realize.\u201d</p><p>Campbell added that a complete damage assessment of the strikes against Iran \u2013 which is not yet complete \u2013 will likely dictate the way forward, and that until then, there is a \u201cnear-to middle-term utility of having forces and resources in the region just from a more operational standpoint.\u201d</p><p>Cohen agrees, noting that despite Trump\u2019s claim that the nuclear sites in Iran had been \u201cobliterated,\u201d questions remain about the damage done and what may come next. </p><p>\u201cThere's an open question about how much destruction we actually did to the nuclear program with that strike,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAnd if you were to have a more sustained [U.S.] offensive, and if you actually wanted to do something somewhat larger that would actually have potentially a more permanent effect, you would need a bigger operation.\u201d And that, he said, would surely involve the American bases in the Gulf.</p><p>Gen. McKenzie, the former CENTCOM commander, said he welcomes the coming \u201cposture review,\u201d and the overall debate about U.S. forces in the Middle East. </p><p>\u201cThat's a national policy decision that we're going to have to make,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much do we want to leave in there? It's a careful calibration. You may not need as much as you've got right now, but you need the ability to flow them back in very quickly if you elect to pull forces out.\u201d</p><p>Ultimately, he said, \u201cWe could leave the region, we could certainly do that, and that's talked about fairly frequently.\u201d But he added that in the short term, that would hurt the U.S. deterrent effect against Iran, the ability to secure safe maritime commerce, and the relationship with those Gulf allies. </p><p>\u201cI think that's the thing to cover when we look at why are our forces there, what effects do they give, what effects do we derive from the fact that they're there \u2013 I think those are all useful things. All of those things are very much in our national interest.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

Litvinenko\u2019s resulting death from acute radiation syndrome significantly strained relations between the UK and Russia, leading to diplomatic expulsions and increased scrutiny of Russian activities in the UK.</p><p>As much as this event became pivotal in the relationships between London and Moscow and called for a major reassessment of the Kremlin\u2019s intentions and capabilities on European soil, it was still regarded by the rest of Europe mostly as a matter of Russia\u2019s internal issues \u2014 Litvinenko was Russian, he ardently criticised the Russian leadership and he was a high-ranking defector. Therefore, he was targeted by the Russian special services. The consensus in the West was that Russia targeted its own renegade citizens, and not citizens from European countries.</p><p>This proved to be a rather comfortable position for the political leadership of the EU at that time (primarily German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy), which was in the middle of exploring deeper economic ties and a more intertwined commerce with Russia.</p><p>This position allowed the economic and political powerhouses of Europe to safely qualify Moscow\u2019s explicitly hostile actions around the same time towards countries like Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Georgia as mere quarrels between the former Soviet republics. The Kremlin\u2019s distribution of Russian passports in Latvia in 2004; the Kremlin\u2019s blockade of rail and ports and manipulation of theDruzhba pipeline oil supply in retaliation for losing the bid for Lithuania\u2019s only oil refinery Ma\u017eeiki\u0173 Nafta; or Russia\u2019s complete ban of imports of Georgian wines as a punishment for Tbilisi\u2019s pro-Western stance in 2006 \u2013 all these events were disregarded as merely regional tensions between the former USSR cohabitants.</p><p>The Swedish airspace incursion that happened the same year, when a Russian military aircraft without active transponders flew simulated attack runs near Gotland, didn\u2019t match this story, but was mainly ignored as an unfortunate mistake in the then non-NATO sky.</p><p>In 2007, when the websites of Estonia\u2019s government, parliament, banks, ministries, newspapers, and broadcasters websites faced the most massive cyber-attack in history, which coincided with a dispute with Russia over the relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, a Soviet-era monument paramount for the Kremlin\u2019s WW2 mythology, the same whispering was heard in EU high cabinets \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a matter of Russia\u2019s backyard\u201d. Nobody would dare to openly call an independent EU state \u201cRussia\u2019s backyard\u201d, but the reaction towards this incident, widely considered the first major state-on-state cyberattack, was telltale.</p><p>The same year, Putin gave his notorious \u2018Munich speech\u2019 \u2014\u2018\u2019The speech in which Putin has told us who he was\u201d, as<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/18/putin-speech-wake-up-call-post-cold-war-order-liberal-2007-00009918\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Politico has put it</u></a>. Among his disturbing and grim messages, one was particularly ominous: \u2018Whether we should be indifferent and aloof to various internal conflicts inside [other] countries? Of course not.\u2019</p><p>This message didn\u2019t take long to materialize. In 2008 Russia invaded Georgia under the pretext of protecting Russian citizens and peacekeepers in the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. This was the climax of the \u201cRussia\u2019s backyard\u201d attitude. Numerous former members of Mikheil Saakashvili\u2019s team, the then-president of Georgia, said that in private conversations with Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel, Condoleezza Rice and their teams, these foreign leaders and their advisors articulated the futility of resistance and the need to accept the reality imposed by the Kremlin. \u201cAccepting this reality\u201d would mean recognizing that Russia does indeed hold a claim on Georgia, which naturally derives from the common soviet history. (Later in 2014 some representatives of the EU behind closed doors were promoting the same thought regarding Crimea).</p><p>Unfortunately, these and many other hostile actions failed to seriously alarm both the American and European political elites of that period, who were seriously engaged in a \u201cRussian reset\u201d. In 2009 Russian military aircraft again violated Swedish airspace, Moscow cut off gas supplies to Ukraine in the dead of winter (affecting also European countries dependent on gas transiting through Ukraine), and Kremlin-backed hackers attacked the German government.</p><p>In the 2010s Russia, either directly or through its proxies, effectuated cyber attacks on the German and Finnish governments, as well as on energy distribution networks in Sweden; sabotaged arms depots in Czechia; stirred up ethnic tensions in Germany with the \u2018Lisa Case\u2019; hacked TV5Monde and manipulated social media to encourage chaos during Yellow Vests protests in France; infiltrated the Aviation Sector and the Spiez laboratory in Switzerland; attempted to assassinate an arms dealer in Bulgaria; and targeted US and Canada diplomats in Cuba and later in other countries (the \u2018Cuba syndrome\u2019).</p><p>Moscow supported anti-fracking movements in Romania to prevent it from developing its own natural gas resources; attempted a coup in Montenegro; jammed Finland\u2019s and Norway\u2019s GPS signals; backed the hacking of the World Anti-Doping Agency; and attempted to sabotage the global internet infrastructure by exploring vulnerabilities in undersea Internet cables connecting Europe and North America.</p><p>Closer to the 2020s Russian operatives attempted to intercept secure military communications from a French military satellite; the Kremlin imposed trade restrictions on Moldovan agricultural products and manipulated energy prices in response to Kishinev\u2019s increased engagement with the EU; and Moscow manipulated the energy market in Bulgaria by restricting gas supplies.</p><p>Russia systematically meddled in top tier popular voting across the globe, with the following being subjects of major investigations for alleged Russian interference: the 2016 UK Brexit referendum, 2016 US presidential elections, 2017 French presidential elections, 2017 German federal elections, 2018 Finnish presidential elections and the 2019 European parliament elections.</p><p>The amount of money and effort spent by the Kremlin to fund and cultivate separatist, xenophobic, anti-Western, Eurosceptic, anti-Americanist, radical, extreme and divisive parties, movements, groups and organizations across the Transatlantic community since Putin came to power is overwhelming.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Apply for a seat at the table today.</em></strong></em></u></a></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>The impenetrable depth of peace</strong></p><p>It looked like all these events were mainly ignored in the West, disregarded as something accidental, if not marginal, which hardly meant anything within the context of the long and deep peace that Europe had seen since the end of WWII.</p><p>Appearing initially as a bitter reminder of the brutality of war, the 8th of May slogan \u201cNever again\u201d has evolved over decades from a yearly admonishment of human tragedies to a concept that was to be enforced literally. For any war to be \u201cnever again\u201d meant that peace must be \u201cforever\u201d. Hence, attaining peace morphed from a righteous and pragmatic complex objective into a quasi-religious ideology that rejects the mere plausibility of conflict \u2013 \u201ca deep peace\u201d.</p><p>A \"Deep peace\" is not merely a state of prolonged absence of war. The doctrine posits that the very discussion of potential martial threats or military readiness could, paradoxically, invoke the specter of war itself. This ideology has been perpetuated by a sustained period of peace which, rather than being seen as a delicate, demanding and maintained state, is viewed as a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>This means that for \u2018peacewalkers\u2019, the modern-day political apostles of this new security cult, peace is self-reinforcing. The longer they can keep the peace, the stronger on their opinion it gets, and the less probable war is. Hence the obsession with preserving peace at all costs, even if such costs are clearly whetting the appetite of the predator, who never really bothered to camouflage his hostile intentions. This almost irrational refusal to accept any possibility of another conflict on the continent, as if it were a fantasy, a fairytale, a myth, has been ruling out the very discussion of the flaws of current peace and its disproportions, as these very discussions were believed to invite war.</p><p>It seems that only at the Munich Security Conference of 2025 western leaders finally realized that war is now not just at their doorstep \u2013 it has already rung the bell.</p><p>This state of \u201cdeep peace\u201d is precisely the reason why all the signals of hostility from Russia have been ignored by the peacewalkers. This was seen in the reaction of the major western governments\u2019 defence budgets to the overt military interventions conducted by Russia in Georgia, in the Middle East and in Ukraine before 2022\u2014the increase of defense spending was literally marginal.</p><p>Both European and American defense spending remained disproportionately low. The European Union's defense budget gradually declined from 4% of GDP in 1960 to a historic low of 1.3% of GDP in 2014. It wasn't until 2020 that European defense spending saw a \u201cnoticeable\u201d increase of 0.3% - up to 1.6% of GDP.</p><p>A similar trend was observed in the United States, where defense spending as a share of GDP stagnated and mostly declined throughout the 2010s, following the peak of the War on Terror. U.S. military expenditure steadily fell from around 4.5% of GDP in 2010 to 3.2% by 2017, even as Russia ramped up its global assertiveness under Putin\u2019s second presidency. It wasn\u2019t until 2020 that U.S. defense spending rebounded to 3.7%, reflecting a shift in priorities as geopolitical tensions escalated.</p><p>The fact that both European and American defense spending remained stagnant for most of the 2010s, suggests that the West did not perceive even Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine as a serious enough threat to warrant an immediate military buildup. This delayed response underscores the extent to which policymakers in both Europe and the U.S. underestimated the long-term implications of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas, as much as Russia being a direct threat.</p><p>Once again, the pervasive\u2014almost sacrosanct\u2014belief in the enduring power of 'deep peace' has led to the deliberate overlooking of clear signals of impending conflict. This illusion of unassailable peace, fostered by decades of relative stability and economic interdependence, has engendered a dangerous complacency among western, but mainly European, nations.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em>Sign up today</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em>.</em></strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>False Idols</strong></p><p>In order to start thinking about how to fix this situation, we first need to understand how we got here. What beliefs guided decision makers? Within what ideological framework did they operate?</p><p>The first reference point is the perception of national security through the lens of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</p><p>The evolution of the role and, more importantly, the capabilities of NATO in the minds of its members happened under the influence of a prolonged peace on the European continent, with some successful military interventions of its members in the 1990s and 2010s, as well as of a certain image of a hi-tech undefeatable army produced by American pop-culture.</p><p>As a result, NATO has become more of a religious icon, rather than a real military force. The belief in NATO\u2019s capacity has become unconditional and it has fastened the religion of \u201cdeep peace\u201d (which is indeed very similar to a religion because of its irrationality), by providing an image of an almighty protector, which will always intervene in case of trouble.</p><p>The truth is, however, a bit different. While NATO might have proven itself successful in regional conflicts like Yugoslavia or the Middle East, it was never ready to face a full-scale war with a proper adversary like Russia or China. It was even less prepared to face hybrid warfare, with war being waged not only with bombs and bullets, but with information and narratives.</p><p>The reliance on nuclear power was paramount in NATO\u2019s deterrence strategy. The war Russia has launched against Ukraine, however, has shown that nuclear weapons deter only the use of other nuclear weapons \u2013 not conventional ones. </p><p>One might argue that the aggression against Ukraine is very different from a hypothetical aggression against NATO, and if Russia were to invade a member of the Treaty the retaliation would be dramatically different. Perhaps. How can, however, the nuclear arsenal defend even member countries against \u2018the green men\u2019, the scam referendums, the total blackouts due to cyber-attacks, the skirmishes with emigrants along the borders, arson of ammunition stores and further hybrid tactics? This begs a clear answer.</p><p>Therefore, a NATO membership can hardly serve as a justification for not having a powerful military able to defend one\u2019s country against an invasion. This, however, was precisely the belief of the \u2018peacewalkers\u2019 for decades: \u2018NATO will take care of us, and it has nukes. We\u2019re safe\u2019.</p><p>Russia has proved them wrong. And now the new White House administration is considering a major NATO policy shift, where the U.S. might not defend a fellow NATO member that is attacked, if the country doesn\u2019t meet the defense spending threshold. Given the alternative view on global security the new U.S. leadership has taken, the moment Washington refuses to invoke Article 5 following a hypothetical encroachment on a member-state \u2013 the world as we know it is finished.</p><p>Another belief where Russia has proved everyone wrong is the na\u00efve idea that it can be deterred by trade. And yet, even the current U.S. administration seems to be falling into this trap once again.</p><p>This illusion has deep roots. Since the early 2000s, the dominant Western orthodoxy held that deeper trade and economic interdependence with Russia would tame its aggressive instincts and gradually bind it to the liberal international order. From Germany\u2019s embrace of <em><em>Wandel durch Handel</em></em> to the U.S. push for Russia\u2019s WTO accession in 2012, the assumption was always the same: prosperity would soften Moscow, and mutual gain would deter aggression.</p><p>It did the opposite.</p><p>The trick is that the fruits and benefits of trade relations are used very differently in democracies and autocracies. While democracies invest the spoils of trade into raising the quality of life of their citizens\u2014because that is the social contract at the heart of their legitimacy\u2014autocratic regimes like Russia spend those same profits on the <em><em>quality of oppression</em></em>: strengthening their propaganda machines and expanding the coercive reach of their security services. These are the twin pillars of modern authoritarian rule.</p><p>In the 2000s, as Russia reaped massive windfalls from energy exports, it poured resources into rebuilding and modernizing its military. Military spending jumped from just $9 billion in 2000 to over $60 billion by 2014. At the same time, Putin\u2019s regime systematically increased funding for the security services and domestic repression apparatus. By 2025, Russia will allocate a staggering 6.3% of its GDP\u2014over $145 billion\u2014to defense, surpassing even Cold War-era levels. In parallel, the budget for internal security, which includes the FSB and National Guard, accounts for over 10% of the federal budget, while state propaganda organs like RT and VGTRK are receiving $1.4 billion annually, an increase of 13% over the previous year.</p><p>Meanwhile, spending on social programs in Russia is projected to fall by 16% in 2025. The regime is not interested in improving the lives of its citizens\u2014it is interested in controlling them.</p><p>Hence, while Russia has been methodically preparing for war, both externally and internally, the West spent the same decades investing in the illusion of a deepening peace. Defense budgets shrank, armies were downsized, and strategic industries were allowed to atrophy. Europe, in particular, funneled billions into Russian energy infrastructure like Nord Stream, while simultaneously allowing itself to become strategically dependent on the very regime it hoped to pacify.</p><p>In the end, the West was trading with Russia under the illusion that it was exporting stability. In reality, it was importing vulnerability.</p><p><strong>Epilogue: the trench of the Saints</strong></p><p>In the end, however, it is not doctrines, nukes, trade or alliances that hold the gates. It is the trench of the saints\u2014where exhausted, ordinary Ukrainians still stand between us and the abyss. </p><p>And yet, instead of standing behind them as one would behind the gates of a besieged city, much of the West regards their resistance with fatigue, irritation, even suspicion\u2014treating Ukraine not as a rampart, but as a liability. The war, they whisper, drags on. The costs are too high. Perhaps it\u2019s time to talk peace, meaning: surrender something, accept something, pretend that nothing essential is lost.</p><p>But what is being lost is everything.</p><p>The trench of the Ukrainian soldier is not only a physical line against Russian advance. It is the symbolic front line of a deeper war\u2014between freedom and tyranny, law and brute force, future and regression. Just as in the 20th century, when the free world had to rally to crush the Nazi regime not with half-measures but with full moral clarity, so too must the West now realize: Ukraine is not the cause of this war\u2019s duration. Ukraine is the reason we still have time.</p><p>If we abandon that trench\u2014or fail to fully support it\u2014we are not avoiding war. We are inviting a greater one.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><em>\u201cOn both sides they imagined that \u2018bluffing\u2019 would suffice to achieve success.

Ames.</p><p>In October 1983, the Iranian government was found responsible for the Beirut barracks bombing by the Islamic Jihad Organization, which killed 241 U.S. service members, 58 French soldiers and 6 civilians, injuring 60. </p><p>These two terrorist bombings apparently emboldened Iran into thinking that terrorism can be effective in eroding U.S. resolve. Thus, Iran continued to support their proxies \u2013 Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen, and Shiite groups in Iraq and Syria \u2013 in its war with the U.S. and Israel.</p><p>In June 1996, Iran was behind the bombing of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 airmen and 498 U.S. and international military and civilian members injured. A U.S. court ruled that Iran \u2013 and its proxy Hezbollah Al-Hejaz -- was responsible for the attack, providing the funding, support and direction.</p><p>This was the very overt Iran, confident in perpetrating these bold acts of terrorism.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

The international community saw some of this in 2009, when the government ensured that incumbent Mahmood Ahmadinejad was reelected president, despite opposition leader, Mir -Hossein Mousavi, having widespread support from the public, promising hope and change. This \u201cGreen Movement\u201d galvanized the Iranian people, resulting in protests, demonstrations and civil disobedience. The regime\u2019s response was predictable: using brutal force to suppress the demonstrations and arrest the protesters.</p><p>This has always been the regime\u2019s response to peaceful protests: suppressing and arresting the protesters. We saw this in September 2022 when Jina Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian -- died in police custody; arrested by the so-called morality policy for improperly wearing her Hijab headscarf. Eyewitnesses reported that Amini was severely beaten and died because of police brutality. </p><p>The Iranian people were irate with the brutal death of Amini. Protests erupted throughout Iran. Iran Human Rights reported that at least 476 people were killed by security forces. Amnesty International reported that Iranian security forces fired into groups with live ammunition and killed protesters by beating them with batons.</p><p>Amini\u2019s death gave rise to the global movement of: Woman, Life, Liberty.</p><p>The regime is now conducting a war against its own people, with widespread arrests of anyone protesting human rights abuses and corruption of the regime in power. </p><p>We would be remiss if we think the Ayatollah has given up on the use of terrorism to intimidate and deal with critics in opposition to his leadership. We would also be remiss if we think the theocracy will cease pursuing a nuclear weapons capability. The regime wants sanctions relief, and they\u2019re prepared to eschew nuclear weapons to get this relief. Eventually, however, they will pursue their nuclear weapons program. We should be prepared.</p><p><strong><em>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/1/irans-terror-legacy-ayatollahs-regime-still-poses-deadly-threat-us/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Times</a></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</em></strong></p><a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em></em></strong></em></u></a>",

Since we are <em>The Cipher Brief</em>, our favorites include not only thrillers and realistic, fast-paced novels \u2013 but some notable works of non-fiction on matters of national security, intelligence and foreign policy. And there\u2019s a cookbook thrown in for good measure.</p><p>We\u2019ve carefully combed through the books that we\u2019ve recently had reviewed by experts who have lived the spy or spy-related life - and we\u2019ve singled out some titles we think you might enjoy at the beach or wherever you\u2019re taking refuge from the summer heat. (<em>And just a note: if you do click and buy using links, we might make a small commission. At least enough to pay for the paper this was printed on.)</em></p><p>Let\u2019s get cooking, shall we?</p><p><strong>Cookbook / Whiskey Category</strong></p><p>Yep, you read that right. Leading our list of summer reads is one that has taken over the #1 spot in Amazon\u2019s whiskey and alcoholic spirits categories, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ZLkEJ4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Spy Walked Into A Bar: A Practitioner's Guide to Cocktail Tradecraft</a></em> by former senior CIA Officers Rob Dannenberg and Joseph P. Mullin Jr. Think of it as a real-life guide to spies and their favorite cocktails. Based on experiences from their clandestine operations backgrounds, Rob and Joe have collected, curated and perfected the cocktails that were enjoyed while celebrating milestone events during their CIA careers. From the drinks they ordered after successfully recruiting assets, to marking the end of a major operation, this book features real life stories and homegrown photos by the authors themselves. </p><p><strong>Novels</strong></p><p>Appropriate for summer, is a new spy novel from Tess Gerritsen, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3G5J0qp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Summer Guests: A Thriller</a></em>. This is Tess\u2019 second spy book, after her very successful TV series a few years ago called <em>Rizzoli and Isles</em>. Gerritsen <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-real-life-spy-coast\" target=\"_self\">talked</a> with Cipher Brief CEO & Publisher Suzanne Kelly about her journey from the popular TV series to spy author in the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-real-life-spy-coast\" target=\"_self\">Cover Stories podcast</a> \u2013 that was just after her first book, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/40wPPIc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Spy Coast</a> </em>was released. Veteran CIA officers Jay and Anne Gruner <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/martinis-and-murder-in-maine\" target=\"_self\">reviewed her latest book</a> about four retired CIA officers living in Maine. The Gruners tell us it is a \u201cgripping account of a complex set of murders, a possible recent kidnapping, and a secretary who was missing for 50 years.\u201d talking about her previous spy-themed book. </p><p>Former U.S. counterterrorism officer and cybersecurity executive Neal Pollard broke the code on Ken Dekleva\u2019s novel, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4nv3byF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Russian Diplomat\u2019s Wife</a></em>. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/i-spy-a-love-story\" target=\"_self\">In his review</a>, Neal says while the book ostensibly is a spy novel set in Vienna, it\u2019s really a love story between two spies. Author (and frequent Cipher Brief contributor) Dekleva draws on his experience as a psychiatrist working for the State Department in many of the locales central to the book and his understanding of human motivation seems to bring his stories to life. We know because we also interviewed the author for the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-russian-diplomats-wife\" target=\"_self\">Cover Stories Podcast.</a></p><p>Speaking of Dekleva, we tapped his expertise to review several books by other authors this year. One worthy of special mention is <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44HgTqG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Poet\u2019s Game: A Spy in Moscow</a></em> by Paul Vidich. Dekleva <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/paul-vidichs-moscow-get-off-the-x\" target=\"_self\">calls</a> the novel is a terrific read about a former CIA station chief in Moscow, now working as an investor in a private equity market in Moscow. The chief was called back to duty though to exfiltrate a former agent who claims to have explosive kompromat regarding America\u2019s president. Navigating between two perilous worlds, those of Moscow and Washington, the storyline seems to offer proof that the cold war never really ended.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em> </em></p><p>Going back even further in time, Dekleva also reviewed <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3GnrWw2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Assignment in Saigon: A Cold War Thriller</a></em> by former senior CIA officer Bill Rapp. In <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/bill-rapps-vietnam-a-different-kind-of-cold-war\" target=\"_self\">his review</a>, Dekleva says that to truly understand the intelligence war in Vietnam, fiction may offer more to the reader and Rapp\u2019s novel is a most worthy read.</p><p>Spy mastery is the theme of retired senior CIA officer Jim Lawler\u2019s latest novel, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44tlQSC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Traitors Tale: A Novel of Treachery within the CIA</a></em>. We turned to another seasoned Agency officer, and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/joseph-w-augustyn\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief expert</a>, Joe Augustyn, to <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/from-spy-master-to-story-teller\" target=\"_self\">review it</a>. Augustyn told us: \u201cJim Lawler has written an intriguing and captivating novel that should satisfy the appetite of any spy novel enthusiast. His character descriptions are impressive, his knowledge of the Agency, its bureaucracy and its inner workings is deep, and his operational savvy is on display throughout. Impressive too is his understanding of the dynamics of personal relationships, both professional and personal, which he calls the \u201cmetaphysics\u201d of spying.\u201d You can learn more about Lawler and his book from this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhEpYXdinnE&amp;t=5s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cover Stories Podcast interview</a>.</p><p><strong>Non- Fiction</strong></p><p>While we have reported on a ton of fine fiction over the past six months, real life stories, history and analysis have played an even larger role in our coverage. Among the books we\u2019d like to invite (or re-invite) to your attention here are: <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4ev0Qzu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Secret Servants of the Crown: The Forgotten Women of British Intelligence</a></em> by Claire Hubbard-Hall and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/neither-swallows-nor-amazons\" target=\"_self\">reviewed</a> for us by Cipher Brief expert <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/tim-willasey-wilsey\" target=\"_self\">Tim Willasey-Wilsey</a>, a real-life former member of the British Foreign Office. Willasey-Wilsey called it a \u201cmarvelous book and a valuable addition to what is known about the early days of the British secret services.\u201d We were lucky to have the author join us on a <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/secret-servants-of-the-crown\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief Cover Stories podcast</a> as well, describing the untold tales of women who silently served \u2013 including Katleen Pettigrew who was the inspiration for Ian Fleming\u2019s \u201cMiss Moneypenny\u201d in the James Bond novels.</p><p>For an American take on unsung women in intelligence, there is <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44sFiiG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Propaganda Girls: The Secret War of the Women of the OSS</a></em> by Lisa Rogak. The former director of the CIA\u2019s Office of Public Affairs, Tammy Kupperman Thorp <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/propaganda-girls-world-war-ii\" target=\"_self\">reviewed</a> the book that focuses on four women who played significant roles in the Office of Strategic Service (OSS) influence campaigns during World War II. She writes that women members of the OSS were in charge of \u201cblack propaganda\u201d primarily a \u201cseries of believable lies designed to cause the enemy soldiers to lose heart and ultimately surrender.\u201d </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

For a fascinating look at that life, check out <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/400hOzY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Story of a CIA Wife: Married to the Craft</a></em> by Rosie Mowatt-Larssen. Veteran journalist and contributing Cipher Brief editor Elaine Shannon <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/a-cia-wifes-tale-of-slipping-kgb-tails-and-other-stories-from-the-cold\" target=\"_self\">reviewed that one</a> for us and lauds the author\u2019s \u201crazor wit\u201d and tales of life in numerous overseas posts including time in Moscow where she helped slip KGB tails, serviced dead drops and lived a life that at times was the stuff of spy thrillers. For more on Rosie \u2013 check out her interview with us for the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/story-of-a-cia-wife\" target=\"_self\">Cover Stories podcast</a>.</p><p>We also have several books about action in World War II that we\u2019d recommend. Let\u2019s start with <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4evexOX\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nothing But Courage: The 82nd Airborne\u2019s Daring D-Day Mission and Their Heroic Charge Across the La Fi\u00e8re Bridge</a></em> by James Donovan. We went to a subject matter expert <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/normandy-la-fiere\" target=\"_self\">to review</a> that one \u2013 retired Army Major General Jack Leide. The book tells of one of the most operationally important but lesser-known stories of World War II. Leide praised the author for providing \u201cincredibly insightful and intricate descriptions and actions of, not only the allied and German military forces arrayed against each other, but how the operation affected many of the local French residents and resistance forces as well.\u201d</p><p>For a far less heroic view of some of the events in that war, there is <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4la0aCs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Traitor of Arnhem: The Untold Story of WWII\u2019s Greatest Betrayal and the Moment that Changed History Forever</a></em> by Robert Verkaik. Recently declassified British MI-5 documents help animate this story of a strategic failure that delayed Allied victory in the war and came at a steep human cost. CIA veteran (and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/martin-petersen\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief expert</a>) Martin Peterson <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/martin-petersen\" target=\"_self\">reviewed the book</a> for us and writes that the author makes a strong circumstantial case that Anthony Blunt, one of Russia\u2019s British agents, played a vital role in passing intelligence to the Germans that damaged the Allies chances of success.</p><p>For a story about operational and intelligence success, there\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44Hi1uq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Taking Midway: Naval Warfare, Secret Codes and the Battle that Turned the Tide of World War II</a></em> by Martin Dugard. Had the Battle of Midway turned out differently, Hawaii and the west coast of the United States stood vulnerable to Japanese attack. The battle was won by the U.S. though through a combination of steely leadership by Admiral Chester Nimitz, and brilliant cryptological work led by a quirky Lieutenant Commander named Joe Rochefort. Normally, our go-to source for book reviewers are gray-haired subject matter experts. For this one, we tried something different and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/taking-a-look-at-the-battle-of-midway\" target=\"_self\">gave the mission to Jack Montgomery</a>, a U.S. Navy ensign currently serving on a Japan-based ship. Montgomery, whose master\u2019s degree thesis was on the Solomon Islands Campaign, notes that the author\u2019s writing style with short punchy sentences makes the book a quick, enjoyable and informative read. Dugard joined us for a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rJ9shOAFZCA?si=_IxSVx-Q3azttufC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cover Stories podcast</a> recently in which he explained how he developed his story-telling style and researched the book.</p><p>Another book sure to fascinate many Cipher Brief readers is <em><a href=\"file://The%20Determined%20Spy/%20The%20Turbulent%20Life%20and%20Times%20of%20CIA%20Pioneer%20Frank%20Wisner\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Determined Spy: The Turbulent Life and Times of CIA Pioneer Frank Wisner</a></em> by veteran journalist Doug Waller. Wisner\u2019s story sounds like fiction. Standout track star in college, lawyer, innovative leader in the OSS during World War II, one of the founders of the CIA, author of successful and unsuccessful covert actions, prominent player in the Georgetown social set \u2013 but victim of what would now be called bipolar disorder \u2013 an illness that eventually led to his taking of his own life. Former senior CIA officer (and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/michael-sulick\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief expert</a>) Mike Sulick <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/covert-action-mental-health-and-a-cold-war-legend-the-story-of-frank-wisner\" target=\"_self\">reviewed</a> the book for us noting that the bio was long overdue and \u201can invaluable contribution to understanding the rewards and pitfalls of covert action as a tool of American foreign policy.\u201d Waller joined us in a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Bb4J847fJi8?si=k1-5aJaPYKDsHrEP\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cover Stories podcast</a> to share some of the secrets of writing about this trailblazing figure of U.S. intelligence.</p><p>A trailblazer of a different kind was Major General Jack Leide whose book, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3IapKsg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Professional Courage: My Journey in Military Intelligence Through Peace, Crisis and War</a></em>, was featured in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/telling-it-like-it-is\" target=\"_self\">a January review</a>. Leide has been inducted into four different military halls of fame. The stories he tells \u2013 and the lessons learned in Vietnam, in China during Tiananmen Square, and as Central Command Director of Intelligence during Desert Shield and Desert Storm make it a valuable read. He also kindly joined us for a <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/professional-courage-telling-it-like-it-is\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief Cover Stories podcast</a> where he told us about the challenges of telling a demanding boss what they need to know rather than what they want to hear.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION</strong> \u2013 On January 27, 2025, President Trump signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/the-iron-dome-for-america/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Executive Order</a> aimed at defending the U.S. against an attack by ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles as well as other advanced aerial attacks; the Golden Dome initiative. The Pentagon moved out smartly to fulfill this order. Industry lined up with ideas on how to defend the U.S. and Department of Defense bureaucrats convened and developed a strategy. All the work that has happened is needed. But we need more.</p><p>We need to build the technology to support defensive systems to secure the homeland from adversary advanced aerial attacks. But we are missing a crucial part of the equation which could be happening now with only limited additional resources.</p><p>The U.S. needs to be moving out diligently to put in place the best collection capability to provide early warning regarding U.S. adversaries. Too often, the U.S. jumps to a solution and forgets that we must start with intelligence to put the building blocks in place to address the solution.</p><p>In this case, the Executive Order asks for a study of adversary threat but that is all. There is nothing about developing intelligence for early warning on adversary intent. This is an important oversight. The U.S. must focus on developing warning that lets decisionmakers know when our adversaries are planning a launch. The important satellite tracking mechanisms that will follow the launches should only be used if the intelligence community misses the early warning.</p><p>To ensure the U.S. is using its resources to its best ability in building the Golden Dome, the entire intelligence infrastructure of collection, technology to support the collection, and ability to exploit the collection - to include analytical experts - must be synergized to provide early warning that an adversary is considering an aerial attack.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Upgrade your access to exclusive content by <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\">becoming a subscriber</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>The literature regarding golden dome focuses on interception and tracking missiles once they are launched. There is a lot of discussion about the need for a defensive system. All of this is warranted, and it is the area where the most money needs to be spent. However, the literature is much less focused on what the U.S. needs to put in place prior to launch to buy time for developing options to counter an attack and limit the risk regarding that decision making process.</p><p>Without the platforms that can collect on adversary intent, capability, movement, and other anomalies, decisionmakers could be left with rushed choices on the use of defensive systems that could result in catastrophic consequences if the technology detects missiles too late or misreads that aerial attacks are coming our way when they may not be.</p><p>Time is the important variable for decision makers. The earlier the intelligence community can present them with analysis and reporting of adversary intent, the better and likely less risky the consequences are for the US.</p><p>For example, if the Intelligence Community (IC) can provide the President with information that an adversary has given an order to prepare an aerial attack against the U.S. - while the attack is being planned but prior to launch - then there are more options to stop that attack.</p><p>The IC is then alerted to track adversary movements so that decisionmakers know how much time they have to decide on an option and which option will work best under the circumstances. In this scenario, U.S. decision makers have days instead of hours, to plan. This allows for a wide range of options to stop a launch - from diplomacy, to sanctions, to military action.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>The current Golden Dome literature talks a lot about tracking these aerial devices and calls for a new look at radars, both space and ground based. As I stated, a reliance on this architecture risks being too late in the decision cycle. Kudos to the Army for recognizing the need for <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/land/2025/03/28/army-looks-to-artificial-intelligence-to-enhance-future-golden-dome/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">smart warning</a> by integrating artificial intelligence into their Integrated Battle Command system, but even this initiative does not hit the early warning collection issue head on.</p><p>LTG Gainey, commanding general of the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) hinted at the issue during a House Armed Services <a href=\"https://armedservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ltg_gainey.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">subcommittee hearing</a> in April when he said the Golden Dome also includes left-of-launch operations, providing deny, delay, disrupt and degrade missile defeat effects in coordination with global combatant commands, the Intelligence Community, Joint Staff, interagency, and Office of the Secretary of Defense. This still does not highlight the need for early warning.</p><p>The U.S. can detect missile launches with its existing Space-Based Infrared System satellites in geosynchronous orbit. These satellites can tell where a ballistic missile is going and where its warheads are likely to fall, but the United States wants to develop better warning and tracking by creating a Custody Layer \u2014 satellites that will watch where all the other guy\u2019s stuff is \u2014 and a Tracking Layer that could also determine where more sophisticated weapons, like hypersonic missiles, are headed.</p><p>Fred Kennedy, the inaugural director of the U.S. Space Development Agency and a former director of DARPA\u2019s Tactical Technology Office, shares in <em><a href=\"https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/golden-dome-analysis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Aerospace America</a></em>, his vision of a Custody Layer: \"a constellation that would be equipped with moving target indicator radar, imaging radar and other sensors, to keep tabs on an adversary\u2019s offensive 'internet of things.' \u2026..These satellites would be the equivalent of Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System and U-2 aircraft, but in space. To strike a missile, you have to know where it could be launched from, after all. Complementing the Custody Layer was the Tracking Layer, the satellites that would detect and track hypersonic or ballistic weapons after launch.\"</p><p>This is all important work and needed but note, it is all focused on launch.</p><p>If decisionmakers are being told by the space-based interceptors that attacks are on the way\u2014there is only one option, to intercept. But what if those interceptors misread the information or what if they did not read the tracking in time? In either scenario it could be the beginning of a catastrophic event that is based on a mistake.</p><p>For that reason, we need to start with the intelligence and put as much effort into that as we are on the interceptors. Collaboration with the Pentagon and other agencies that track satellite imagery is key. I would also add that the Defense Intelligence Agency needs to play a primary role in this initiative which must include increased human intelligence and all forms of open source to include commercial data.</p><p>With the intelligence community and department of defense getting smaller, we need to work together more than ever. Defending our nation is a team sport that requires strong intelligence to set up decision makers and operators to make the best decisions possible, helping to mitigate risk. This cannot happen without the defense and intelligence communities working together to provide the first warning\u2014way before launch. Now is the time to push the intelligence community to upgrade technologies that track missiles by providing warning of aberrations in patterns before launch.</p><p>By using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to synthesize critical technical collection with anomalies in open source (OSINT), commercial (CAI), and personal (PAI) data, we could have the cultural breakthrough we need to change how the intelligence community uses technical collection fused with OSINT, CAI, PAI and AI. Against this national security backdrop, we could have our first big win in changing how we process intelligence and safeguard the US. NGA\u2019s Maven program is a big step in the right direction of fusing intelligence to support DoD and the rest of the national security establishment. This practice needs to be more widespread.</p><p>Now is the time to use proven technology with expert analysis to provide decision makers increased time and space to counter aerial attacks on the homeland. The resources involved, compared to the amount needed for satellites and lasers to shoot down the missiles, is minimal. This action can be started now, the technology exists. Putting in place early warning buys time for the US to develop the rest of the Golden Dome security.</p><p><em><strong>Who\u2019s Reading this?

I was struck by how effusive, really, President Trump was in his praise of what happened at The Hague and very clear in his commitments. What's your take on how that all played out?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>I think I\u2019m more relieved than surprised. I'm biased because I\u2019ve been a NATO officer my whole Army life, as all Army officers are part of the Alliance. I recognize its importance for America's strategic interests. I'm glad that the president did what he did. There was a huge sigh of relief in the Hague that he even showed up. There was some anxiety about that, or that he might blow it up somehow. So the best outcome did happen. He was there. He stayed for the entire thing. He met with President Zelensky. We got an agreement on 5% across the alliance, with one exception, and then a public affirmation of American commitment to the alliance by the president. That's pretty good.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>You\u2019re referring to Article 5 of the NATO charter, which says an attack on any member must be met by all other members. There\u2019s been a kind of rallying cry among some Trump supporters that the idea that American soldiers would fight for Estonia, for example, that\u2019s never gonna happen \u2014 that's not America first. Talk a bit about the significance of that specific commitment, because it seems to put to rest what's been said before on that front.</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which created NATO, says an armed attack on one shall be considered an armed attack on all. That commitment to collective security has been the glue that held the alliance together. The Soviet Union for decades, now Russia and other adversaries, see this commitment of now 32 nations that if one is attacked, all the other nations would consider it an armed attack on themselves. That was such a powerful part of the deterrence when it's backed up by real credible capabilities. </p><p>For the first time in my life, in his last administration, the president called that into question. I was horrified. That sort of opens a door to a terrible miscalculation by Moscow that maybe the U.S. would not be so committed. Then the Russians could achieve what has always been their dream, which is to break the alliance, to see that members would not respond, and also to continue driving a wedge between Europe and North America. So it was important that the president affirmed it very strongly, clearly and publicly. </p><p>Now, some people ask why would we have American soldiers dying for Estonia? It's an absolutely ridiculous assertion because that is people not understanding why the alliance is so important for us. By the way, this Article 5 has only been invoked once in the almost 80 years of history of NATO, and that was after 9/11, when you had Estonians who came and died because of the United States. </p><p>Our economic interests are tied to a very prosperous Europe, so we need Europe to be stable and secure and prosperous because it affects our economy. Secondly, the access that we have in Europe from the UK all the way to Turkey and everywhere in between enables us to project power, not only in Europe, but also into the Middle East and down into Africa.</p><p>And of course, even the United States does not have enough capability to do everything that needs to be done to protect all of our interests around the world. We need allies, and all of our best and most reliable allies come from Europe, as well as Canada and Australia.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>NATO, the most successful and longest alliance in the history of the world, has 32 nations now. There are going to be huge disputes between nations all the time. France kicked NATO out back during the time of de Gaulle. They left the military structure of NATO for several decades, but came back. The U.S. had huge debates with the UK and France after the Suez crisis. Turkey and Greece have been almost at war throughout. So, there are always challenges inside any sort of a coalition or alliance for all kinds of obvious reasons. </p><p>The thing that kept us together was always American leadership and the commitment of several nations to say, look, this is too important for us to lose this collective security because of some argument over an economic thing or past grievance. And there's a reason that there are nations still in a queue wanting to join NATO, because they know that their security is so much better if they're part of this alliance.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>The core takeaway seems to be this pledge that all the members except for Spain have made to spend 5% of their GDP on military or military-related stuff. How big a deal is this?</em></em></p><p> <em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges:</em></strong></em> It's an expectation. It's a commitment that everybody achieves this 5% threshold for investment in defense: 3.5% for traditional, what we would consider defense investments, equipment, training, ammunition, personnel; and then 1.5% for infrastructure, rail, ports, cyber protection, all the things necessary to be able to move alliance capabilities around. </p><p>Obviously these things will be exploited in some countries. That would not shock me. But the key was that nations are going to invest in infrastructure, which is badly needed, and the cyber protection of this transportation infrastructure. But also, 3.5 % of GDP, that's almost double for every country from what it was 10 years ago. The United States is not even at 3.5 right now, by the way. So this is going to be a real increase. </p><p>Having said all that\u2014and I do believe in the importance of a metric like that\u2014the most important thing, of course, is capability. Do we have the actual capability to do what we're supposed to do? That\u2019s what will deter the Russians, not a sign on the board that says, hey, we're 3.5. It\u2019s real capability: units that are properly trained, fully manned and have lots of ammunition, aircraft that fly, ships that sail. That's got to be the focus. So I'm glad we got this done, but now we've got to make sure that we turn that money into real capability.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>Do you mean how they spend it? </em></em> </p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>That is a part of it. Where does it go? Germany has a lot of money out there, but the processes are still several years behind. So they've got to fix things internally to take all these euros and turn them into combat formations and capability. They've got the right leadership now to do that in Chancellor Merz.</p><p>But also, I think it's important that we emphasize the importance of readiness to be able to fight tonight. This is a mindset thing. It's not just about buying new planes and equipment and hundreds of thousands of drones. Are you ready to actually deploy on very short notice and fight tonight? Can you get there and do you have what you need? To me, that has got to be job one for every secretary of defense, ministers of defense\u2014 readiness.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>On that \u201cfight tonight\u201d point, it is worth noting that these pledges are to be met by 2035. That's 10 years from now. And obviously, some of the stuff we're talking about takes a long time to manufacture and get out to the battlefield. How concerned are you about that time frame?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges:</em></strong></em> It took us 10 years to get where we are now from Wales. A lot of nations are now spending more than they have since the end of the Cold War. So, of course, I don't like it. We should already be there, including the United States. But I think what we'll see is different leaders, including the American president, continue to track every year. You can't do what they call a hockey stick, where you stay where you are for eight years and then expect that you'll get credit for jacking it up at the end. So there's going to be continued pressure.</p><p>But honestly I don't think too many nations are going to need that pressure. What we're seeing in Germany and in the UK, Finland all the way down to Romania. They're not confused about who the enemy is \u2014 it's Russia. These countries were already moving well beyond 3.5% before this summit. So, I think we're on the right arc and right direction in most places, just not all.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

It suddenly seemed a little bit on the back burner. What are your thoughts on how Ukraine comes out of this summit?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>This is my biggest disappointment from this summit. Ukraine was exactly, what you said, put on a back burner. I'm glad that President Zelensky showed up, that he was invited and that he attended. I'm glad that President Trump met with President Zelensky for about 45 minutes or so. While the president did not reveal a lot of the details, he was more positive about Ukraine than I'd heard from him in quite some time. </p><p>Now, to be candid, the president changes his mind all the time but I hope that this signals that he is more willing and open to helping Ukraine as most of our European allies are. I had hoped that this summit would be another affirmation by the Alliance that we're going to do everything we can to help Ukraine. The organizers shortened it in hopes of making sure that President Trump would stay for the whole thing. And so Ukraine was kind of taken out of the agenda. </p><p>Nonetheless, what's most important is that there seems to have been a positive meeting there. And most of our European allies are even more committed to helping Ukraine defeat Russia.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>You've made the point that Russia is incredibly weakened militarily right now with casualties, the economy, and so forth. And it doesn't seem, in that sense, to be much of a threat. Of course, everything we're talking about and what they were talking about at the summit is all about the Russia threat. So how should we understand the nature of that threat given how weak the country is today?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>This is a great question. Russia, I was certain, would not have made it this long. Given the casualties that they have suffered, the effects of some sanctions on them, and now it looks like they've probably lost Iran as an ally or a source of drones. But China has picked up some of the slack. North Korea continues to provide ammunition. And Russia right now has transitioned to a wartime economy because of course they don't have to worry too much about whether or not the peasants are unhappy that they can't get a new refrigerator. Putin does not have to respond to this sort of thing the way any other democratic leader would have to respond. So he's putting a lot of resources into this. </p><p>That would be over if we could figure out how to stop Russia from exporting oil to China and India. But as long as they can keep doing that, and as long as oil prices stay up, then Russia can keep doing what they're doing for quite some time. At the recent economic forum that Russia hosts each year, President Putin sort of downplayed the economic situation challenges they have. But his own people publicly were saying that they're almost in recession, that they are in fact in trouble.</p><p>What I am sure of is that if Ukraine capitulates or fails, or if we turn our back on Ukraine and Russia is able to take a couple of years to rebuild and fix what is broken, they will be knocking on the door of Moldova and probably of Latvia. Their objective is to break the alliance, to show NATO that nations are not really willing to fight against Russia over a piece of Estonia or Latvia. That would be their terrible miscalculation. So to make sure that the Russians never make that terrible miscalculation, we have to get back to where we were in the Cold War days of spending what's necessary, being prepared so that you can have another 40-50 years of no war with Russia.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

    "description": "<p>Steps you can take to report the theft and check if it\u2019s being resold \u2013 as well as how to protect your next one</p><p>Whether you use your bike to commute daily, for a quick trips to the shops or long rides to keep fit, having it stolen can be a nightmare. Here\u2019s what to do if yours goes missing.</p><p>Report the theft to the police and describe the bike in as much detail as possible, giving the model, make and where it was stolen. You should also include a description of any scratches, dents and marks that could help identify it, and a picture if you have one. You can go into your local police station or call 101 in the UK to file a report. Make sure you get a crime reference number.</p><p>Home insurance policies will often cover your bike when it\u2019s at home but you will probably have needed to pay extra to extend this for when you\u2019re out and about, or if you have a valuable bike. Report the loss to your insurer and give it the crime reference number. Your bike will not be covered if you failed to look after it, such as not locking it securely or with a suitable lock.</p><p>Declare your bike stolen on <a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a>, a UK bike database \u2013 you can do this even if you have not registered your bike on there before. It will help improve the chances of your bike being recovered if there are pictures and descriptions of the bike, and where it was stolen.</p><p>Post on bike and cycling forums, such as <a href=\"https://forum.cyclinguk.org/\">Cycling UK Forum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeforums.net/]\">Bike Forum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclechat.net/\">CycleChat</a> in case people come across it when looking to buy a new bike.</p><p>Look on resale sites such as Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace and eBay to see whether someone is trying to sell your bike. You can set up alerts for bikes that are the same make and model. If you find one that looks like yours, alert the police \u2013 they may be able to recover it. It is not advisable to set up a sting or try to deal with the case yourself.</p><p>Alert the local community on neighbourhood forums such as Nextdoor or local Facebook groups and get in touch any bike shops nearby in case someone comes in to the shop and tries to sell one that matches your description.</p><p>Scuff the frame up a bit using sandpaper, paint and stickers so it is less appealing to thieves. Some kitsch, drawn-on hearts might save you a lot of hassle in the future.</p><p>Register it on <a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a> and upload pictures alongside the frame number, which is usually found on the bottom bracket shell between the pedals or on the rear dropouts where the back wheel slots in. This will help the police trace it back to you if it is stolen and recovered.</p><p>Invest in two high-quality locks to make your bike less of a target. At least one of these should be a good-quality D-lock. Be sure to attach the frame to the stand when locking up.</p><p>Take any removable parts with you whenever you leave it.</p><p>Find and apply for your nearest cycle parking. This gives another layer of protection, but be sure to still lock up securely. In cities there are also many cycle hangars, such as Cyclehoop, which are small bike stores on residential streets you can apply for at a small cost each year. <a href=\"https://www.cyclehoop.rentals/\">Check whether there\u2019s one near you</a>.</p><p>Conceal a Bluetooth tracker on your bike to help locate it if it goes missing. The smaller and more discreet the tracker, the better. Good spots to hide them include under the seat or inside the handlebar. Apple AirTag and Tile Sticker are popular among bike owners.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jun/11/what-to-do-if-your-bike-is-stolen-and-how-to-break-the-cycle\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "description": "<p><strong>4 March 1895</strong>: The popularity of cycling among the aristocracy is remarkable as the bicycle used to be looked upon as the poor man\u2019s horse</p><p>The increasing popularity of cycling among the \u2018aristocracy\u2019 is remarkable. Among recent recruits may be mentioned Lord Zetland, Lady Havelock Allan, Sir Joseph Pease, the Earl of Camperdown, the Duke of Westminster, and two of the daughters of the late Earl of Iddesleigh. Heretofore the only objection urged against the pastime has been its vulgarity. The bicycle was looked upon as the poor man\u2019s horse, and those who patronised it were considered very ordinary people. The utility of the bicycle as a means of conveyance, its capacity for causing harmless and elevating pleasure, and its undoubted health-giving qualities were all ignored at the dictates of the fashionable world. The said fashionable world have suddenly discovered the virtues of the cycle, and, ignoring the fact that even butchers\u2019 boys may derive pleasure from the same source, they have taken to it in numbers. The middle class, a large proportion of whom are born snobs, will, now that the only objection is removed, join the ranks in thousand. It will have an effect also even on those who are not snobs.</p><p>Heretofore many professional and business men have been afraid to appear in public on wheels simply because it would damage them from a business point of view. I have known leading doctors who have made a practice of rising in summer at 5am, to enjoy a long ride before breakfast simply because they dared not appear in public except in the irreproachable brougham. For such as these the bar is being removed.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/04/cycling-notes-snobbery-female-riders-and-dispensing-with-a-brake-1895\">Continue reading...</a>",

With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing</span><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1. What is affiliate marketing?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is an affiliate program?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.&nbsp; Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;5. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing?</span></h4><p><!--Ads Managed by AdSpyglass.com-->\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;6. Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7. Where do I find qualified publishers?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius.

Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10. What is a super affiliate?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.&nbsp; Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">11. How do we track publisher sales activity?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;12.

What is a commission rate?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Commission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Who manages your affiliate program?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Some merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">18. What is a cookie?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Cookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents.

If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.</span><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Imagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don\u2019t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That\u2019s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It\u2019s like your computer\u2019s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called \u201cBit Gold.\u201d However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">So, What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:</b></span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain collects information in \u201cblocks\u201d.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blocks form chains, which are called \u201cBlockchains.\u201d</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>Let\u2019s get to know more about the blockchain.</b></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How does blockchain work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Here\u2019s how it works:</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Someone or a computer will transacts</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The transaction is transmitted throughout the network.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A network of computers can confirm the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a block</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The blocks are linked together to create a history.</span></li></ul><p></p>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">And that\u2019s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it\u2019s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.</span></li></ul><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How are Blockchains used?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been\u2014so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is Blockchain Decentralization?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology is safe, even if it\u2019s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called \u201cDecentralization,\u201d meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain guarantees your data's authenticity\u2014not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros and Cons of Blockchain</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Accuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Safe, private, and easy transactions</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Provides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal information</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Cons</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Data storage has limits.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It has a risk of being used for illicit activities&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Frequently Asked Questions About Blockchain</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">I\u2019ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is Blockchain a cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the most prominent blockchain company?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Who owns Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It\u2019s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency&nbsp;</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

if you are a non-fiction writer</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Go for ProWritingAid if you are a fiction writer.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">ProWritingAid is better at catching errors found in long-form content. However, Grammarly is more suited to short blog posts and other similar tasks.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">ProWritingAid helps you clean up your writing by checking for style, structure, and content while Grammarly focuses on grammar and punctuation.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Grammarly has a more friendly UI/UX whereas; ProWritingAid offers complete feedback on big picture writing.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Both ProWritingAid and Grammarly are awesome writing tools, without a doubt. but as per my experience, Grammarly is a winner here because Grammarly helps you to review and edit your content. Grammarly highlights all the mistakes in your writing within seconds of copying and pasting the content into Grammarly\u2019s editor or using the software\u2019s native feature in other text editors.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Not only does it identify tiny grammatical and spelling errors, it tells you when you overlook punctuations where they are needed. And, beyond its plagiarism-checking capabilities, Grammarly helps you proofread your content. Even better, the software offers a free plan that gives you access to some of its features.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>",

By recording any kind of information\u2014such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts\u2014in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can\u2019t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3) What makes an NFT valuable?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br />\n</span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn\u2019t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4) How do NFTs work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can\u2019t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFTs also contain smart contracts\u2014small computer programs that run on the blockchain\u2014that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5) What\u2019s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you\u2019ll be able to upload and sell your creations</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain\u2014the bitcoin ledger of transactions\u2014and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10) How do we buy an NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">11) Can i mint NFT for free?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it?</span></h3>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Why are people investing so much in NFT?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><span>&nbsp;Non-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don\u2019t own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet.</span><br /></span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">That\u2019s a wrap.

Why is email marketing important?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email is the marketing tool that helps you&nbsp; create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak&nbsp; to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is benefits of email marketing?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email marketing is best way for creating long term relationship with your clients, and increasing sales in our company.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Benefits of email marketing for bussiness:</span></div><div><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Better brand recognition</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Statistics of what works best</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More sales</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Targeted audience</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More traffic to your products/services/newsletter</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Build credibility</span></li></ul></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Most&nbsp; bussinesses are using email marketing and making tons of money with email marketing.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Again, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be&nbsp; times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your&nbsp; data to decide.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;4. Which metrics should I be looking at?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The two most important metrics for email marketing are&nbsp; open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5. How do I write a decent subject line?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing&nbsp; the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for&nbsp; A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and&nbsp; simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,&nbsp; then repeated&nbsp; at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example \"Click here to download the premium theme for free.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><br />\n\n<br />6. Is email marketing still effective?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site&nbsp; hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans&nbsp; see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely&nbsp; see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span><br /></span><br />\n\n<br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Buying an email list is&nbsp; waste of time &amp; money. These email accounts are unverified and not interested in your brand. The mailing list is useless if your subscribers do not open your emails. There are different ways to grow your mailing list.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span>Give them a free ebook and host it on a landing page where they have to enter the email to download the file and also create a forum page on your website, asks your visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collects email addresses to follow up with them.</span><br />\n\n<br /></span></div>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a\"></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8. How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">If the&nbsp; subject line of the email is irrelevant to&nbsp; customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus&nbsp; on sales, offers and discounts.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Submit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers. You can also update them on recent trends in your industry. The basic role of an email is first and foremost to&nbsp; connect with customers, get the most out of this tool.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">9. What is the difference between a cold email and a spam email?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Cold emails are mostly sales emails that are sent with content align to the needs of the recipient. It is usually personalized and includes a business perspective. However, it is still an unsolicited email. And all unsolicited emails are marked as SPAM.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Regularly receiving this type of unsolicited email in your users' inboxes, chances are&nbsp; your emails will soon be diverted to&nbsp; spam or junk folders. The most important thing to prevent this from happening is to respect your recipients' choice to opt-out of receiving emails from you. You can add the links to easily unsubscribe. You must be familiar with the CAN-SPAM Act and its regulations.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10. Where can I find email template?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Almost all email campaign tools provide you with ready-made templates. Whether you use MailChimp or Pardot, you'll get several email templates ready to use.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;However, if you want to create a template from scratch, you can do so.Most of email campaign tools have option to paste the HTML code of your own design.&nbsp;</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br />11. What email marketing trend will help marketers succeed in 2022?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is it a trend to listen to&nbsp; and get to know your customers? I think people realize how bad it feels for a brand or a company to obsess over themselves without knowing their customers personal needs. People who listen empathetically and then provide value based on what they learn will win.</span></div></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span><br /></span><span>Final Saying</span></span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;You can approach email marketing in different ways.

This can help you understand the demographics, interests, and behaviors of your target audience. This information helps determine the direction of your content so that it resonates with them. The most important tools to consider in Facebook Audience Insights are Demographics and Behavior. These two sections provide you with valuable information about your target market, such as their age and from where they belong, how much time they spend on social media per day, what devices they use to access it, etc.<br /></span>\n<br /></span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">There is another section of Facebook Audits that is very helpful. This will let you know the interests, hobbies, and activities that people in your target market are most interested in. You can use this information to create content for them about things they will be about as opposed to topics they may not be so keen on.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Facebook+Audience+Insights&amp;oq=Facebook+Audience+Insights&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i176j69i58.244j0j4&amp;client=ms-android-transsion-infinix-rev1&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Visit&nbsp;</span>Facebook Audience Insights From Here</a></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7.
