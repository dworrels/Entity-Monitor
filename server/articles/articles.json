    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/afghanistan-taliban-russia",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>In recent weeks, reports of Russia considering formal engagement and recognition of the Taliban have reignited debate around international approaches to the de facto rulers of Afghanistan. But contrary to assumptions of ideological or strategic alignment, Moscow\u2019s overtures appear rooted more in fear than affinity.</p><p><strong>A Security-Driven Outreach</strong></p><p>Russia\u2019s posture toward the Taliban must be viewed through a regional security lens. In intelligence and counterterrorism circles, there is increasing alarm in Moscow over the surge in foreign extremist fighters now operating with impunity inside Afghanistan. Russia has long claimed that ISIS-K and affiliated groups enjoy covert support from Western intelligence services, a claim that is exaggerated but nonetheless fuels deep strategic paranoia within the Kremlin.</p><p>Recent intelligence reports indicate a notable uptick in foreign terrorist presence, particularly in northern and eastern provinces bordering Central Asia. Russia is concerned not just about Afghanistan\u2019s instability, but about its spillover potential into Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, all countries with fragile internal balances and historical ties to Moscow.</p><p>In this context, engagement with the Taliban is less about diplomatic recognition and more about gaining operational access, establishing surveillance footholds, and ensuring a minimal level of information-sharing. For Russia, the Taliban may be a tactical irritant, but foreign jihadist groups are a strategic threat.</p><p><strong>Taliban\u2019s Quest for Legitimacy</strong></p><p>From the Taliban\u2019s side, any engagement by major powers is quickly repackaged as de facto recognition\u2014a form of validation they desperately seek. Lacking internal legitimacy and having seized power through force, the Taliban views external recognition as a shortcut to international acceptance, regardless of the terms or the motives of the recognizing party.</p><p>Whether Russia\u2019s engagement is rooted in security fears or strategic containment is irrelevant to the Taliban; what matters is the optics. This dynamic creates a dangerous asymmetry, where tactical coordination by foreign states can be misrepresented as endorsement of Taliban governance.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Upgrade your access to exclusive content by </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\"><em>becoming a subscriber</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>The China Factor: Quiet Watchfulness</strong></p><p>Speculation has mounted that China may follow suit. However, Beijing\u2019s interests in Afghanistan remain fundamentally different from Moscow\u2019s. For China, the overriding concern is the presence of Uyghur militants \u201cEast Turkistan Islamic Movement\u201d, many of whom have historically sought refuge in Afghanistan\u2019s east.</p><p>At the same time, China\u2019s strategic posture is fixated on its global rivalry with the United States, particularly in the domains of economic dominance and technological superiority\u2014most notably in artificial intelligence. Afghanistan, in this framework, is a peripheral concern. As long as Beijing can secure its western flank through covert financial leverage, trade access, and intelligence coordination, it has little incentive to formally recognize the Taliban. Such a move would carry diplomatic costs without any meaningful strategic return.</p><p><strong>A Word of Caution for the International Community</strong></p><p>While Russia and China may justify Taliban engagement based on narrow national security imperatives, these moves carry broader strategic and ethical risks. First, they undermine the international consensus that recognition must be contingent on inclusive governance, human rights, and counterterrorism compliance. Second, such recognition risks legitimizing radicalization and authoritarian consolidation through force, potentially emboldening similar movements elsewhere.</p><p>Finally, tactical engagement by states like Russia must be carefully managed to avoid the legitimization of Taliban rule, particularly in media narratives. Intelligence-sharing or backchannel coordination is a longstanding reality in conflict zones, but it must be explicitly framed as counterterrorism containment, not state-to-state diplomacy.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em><strong>Join us in Sea Island, Georgia for The Cipher Brief's </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>2025 Threat Conference</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> from October 19-22.

Afghanistan, under Taliban control, is rapidly becoming an ungoverned space\u2014one that external powers increasingly fear more than favor.</p><p>For the United States, these developments represent a critical inflection point. As global powers move from isolation to tactical engagement with the Taliban, Washington must lead in upholding the principle that recognition should never precede reform. Any diplomatic engagement\u2014whether multilateral or bilateral\u2014must be explicitly tied to measurable outcomes: meaningful counterterrorism cooperation, the protection of civil liberties, and inclusive political participation that reflects Afghanistan\u2019s ethnic and social diversity.</p><p>In the absence of such standards, the international community risks legitimizing a regime that has shown little intent to evolve\u2014and considerable capacity to destabilize.</p><p>At the same time, the United States should take a parallel step to support the formation of a legitimate political opposition to the Taliban\u2014one that represents the hopes of Afghans for a sovereign, democratic, and inclusive future. Working in coordination with international partners, Washington can help this coalition articulate a long-term political vision for the country. Though limited in scope, such a move would send a powerful message to Afghans inside and outside the country, to regional allies and adversaries alike, and even to the Taliban: that Afghanistan\u2019s future will not be defined by force alone. Most importantly, it would empower Afghans themselves particularly the new generation to lead the struggle for their nation's destiny.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

    "description": "<p>Inside a cavernous 1930s-era warehouse on the northern edge of Brooklyn, the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90634229/how-an-ancient-building-technique-could-help-solve-the-climate-crisis\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ancient and all-but-extinct art of stone carving</a> is having a 21st century rebirth. This is the new headquarters of <a href=\"https://www.monumentallabs.co/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Monumental Labs</a>, a quirky but audacious startup that is combining the meticulous chisel-and-hammer craft of stone carving with the prowess, speed, and efficiency of robotics and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">artificial intelligence</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using an $8 million round of venture capital funding, the 2-year-old company is turning this aging warehouse into a modern stonecutting factory capable of quickly producing highly detailed decorative facades, museum-grade marble sculptures, and towering stone monuments. And if founder Micah Springut gets his way, the company will soon be trying its robotic arms at an even grander project: reinventing the way buildings get built.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91367056\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/16-91366303-stonecutter-robots.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Monumental Labs]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking through the warehouse on a recent day, Springut shows off the 30-foot-high ceilings of the main fabrication floor, where more than a dozen seven-axis robotic carving arms will soon be chipping away at massive blocks of granite, limestone, and marble, turning them into towering sculptures and statues. When the 37,000-square-foot facility comes online in the fall, Monumental Labs will begin fine-tuning its stone carving process to quickly and affordably produce structural stone that can be used to build everything from private homes to multi-level apartment complexes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91367058\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/02-91366303-stonecutter-robots.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Monumental Labs]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be a big step up from the space Monumental Labs currently leases outside of New York City. That&#8217;s where the company produced its first significant projects, including restorations of decorative stone adorning <a href=\"https://www.monumentallabs.co/architecture\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Carnegie Hall</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DISnwFWOBAT/?img_index=4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Frick Museum</a>, which are mostly cut by robots and then hand-finished by trained stone carvers. It&#8217;s a process that can cut delivery times for sculptures and decorative facade treatments from months to weeks. But in its current location, Monumental Labs has only been able to deploy two robots, and its monument carving capacity tops out at 12 feet. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91367060\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/08-91366303-stonecutter-robots.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Monumental Labs]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t do an entire facade, we can&#8217;t do an entire building, we can&#8217;t do a monumental arch,&#8221; Springut says of the existing workshop. Behind him in the new factory, SUV-sized slabs of marble sit idly by, waiting for the robotic arms to be installed and activated. &#8220;All of that kind of stuff, large-scale works, both public and private, could be done here now,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new factory space and capacity is made possible by the $8 million funding round, which was led by <a href=\"https://sevensevensix.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Seven Seven Six</a>, Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s venture capital fund. Founding partner Katelin Holloway, who led the deal with Monumental Labs, says the company offers a perfect blend of technology and humanity. &#8220;They&#8217;re bringing craftsmanship back to architecture,&#8221; she says. &#8220;This technology has massive potential to transform how we build cities, bringing back that artistic magic we almost lost.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91367062\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/09-91366303-stonecutter-robots.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Monumental Labs]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Springut says the new space will help the company keep up with growing demand. It&#8217;s currently working on several large-scale sculpture projects for private clients, decorative stone facades, and a set of gargoyles that will be added to a new building at an undisclosed university in the South.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big goal, though, is getting into structural stone. These are giant, Lego-like blocks of stone that are precisely cut to form thick and strong building bases and walls. With a<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90728583/new-buildings-are-huge-carbon-hogs-heres-how-to-design-them-to-last-for-centuries\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> lower embodied carbon footprint and a much longer lifespan than concrete</a>, structural stone is seen as an environmentally friendly alternative construction method. It&#8217;s also one humans have relied on for millennia. &#8220;We basically built with stone for all of history until about 110 years ago when industrialization came and changed what became efficient to build with,&#8221; says Springut. &#8220;The cost of fabricating stone, cutting it, and shaping it into the form you want became far, far more expensive than doing that with concrete.&#8221; Robotics and automation, he says, will dramatically lower that down to as little as 25% of the cost of building with concrete.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91367063\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/11-91366303-stonecutter-robots.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Monumental Labs]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-future-of-structural-stone\">The future of structural stone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrew Lane can&#8217;t wait. He&#8217;s an attorney and prospective developer based in Austin who has become obsessed with the idea of using structural stone to develop new buildings\u2014partly out of frustration with the aesthetics of modern buildings and partly because stone buildings have such longevity. Standing on his balcony in downtown Austin, he pans his phone&#8217;s camera from the Renaissance revival-style <a href=\"https://tspb.texas.gov/prop/tc/tc/capitol.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Texas Capitol Building</a> to the new glass-and-steel office and residential towers a few blocks south. &#8220;America could rise, America could fall, that capitol building ain&#8217;t going anywhere. That office building right there, that glass, that&#8217;s gone in 70 years, max,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I just don&#8217;t understand why we want to build cities like that.&#8221; He&#8217;s hoping to change course by building townhouses or apartments in Austin using stone carved by Monumental Labs, but is waiting to learn more about exactly how much it will cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Springut says that&#8217;s still an open question. Monumental Labs has other developer clients who are eager to get started, but everyone first wants to see what the company can produce with its new fabrication space. That&#8217;s why one of the first projects Monumental Labs will work on once its new facility is up and running is a 30-foot-tall observation tower built out of structural stone and constructed right in the corner of its main fabrication hall. Springut says that should be enough to get some of these developer clients to commit to building. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a number of clients who are just ready for us to be ready,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s still plenty that&#8217;s needed before Monumental Labs is actually ready, though. The biggest hurdle is refining the technology behind its stone cutting ambitions, and training its own AI systems to handle the now largely manual process of understanding the cutting paths and the tool heads needed to turn a multiton chunk of limestone into the building blocks of a townhome.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91367064\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/14-91366303-stonecutter-robots.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Monumental Labs]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be using reinforcement learning to effectively come up with the optimal toolpaths to see a 3D model, and based on the curvature and the geometric forms, to choose what are the right tools, or what are the right angles of attack,&#8221; Springut says. &#8220;And when we do that, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to bring the cost of fabricating stone down by 80% to 90%.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company&#8217;s proprietary software, he says, will learn from every carving project its robots undertake, getting better over time. This new facility will be part of building that institutional knowledge, using its new fleet of robots to crank out up to 100 life-sized sculptures per year, and possibly a few full-sized buildings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that will have to wait until the robots can actually move into the building. First, Springut says, the 1930s-era complex needs some upgrades, including a reinforced foundation capable of handling the weight of the stones to be carved. Before Monumental Labs can revolutionize the world of building, it&#8217;ll have to bring its own headquarters into the 21st century.</p>",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91367413/meme-coin-prices-today-dogecoin-shiba-inu-rise-crypto-rally-why",
    "description": "<p>Earlier today, the price of Bitcoin <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91366551/bitcoin-price-today-120000-why-btc-up-crypto-rally-explained\">passed the $120,000</a> milestone for the first time, marking a dramatic rise for the world&#8217;s most popular cryptocurrency over the last three months. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not just mainstream tokens that are enjoying a rally this week. So-called meme coins, including Shiba Inu, Elon Musk favorite Dogecoin, and President Trump&#8217;s own Trump Coin, have also seen their value increase in recent days. Here are some of the latest figures from <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/\">crypto price tracker</a> CoinMarketCap:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pepecoin</strong> (PEP) Up 24.31 in 7 days</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dogecoin</strong> (DOGE): Up 20.73% in 7 days</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shiba Inu</strong> (SHIB): Up 17.19% in 7 days</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Official Trump</strong> (TRUMP) Up 12.52% in 7 days</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is in addition to stock price increases for companies that are crypto adjacent, such as Coinbase, whose shares are up 47.98% over the last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-are-crypto-prices-rising\">Why are crypto prices rising?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile and tend to fluctuate with broader market conditions, so it&#8217;s not always easy to tell what is driving any particular rally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, one clear reason why crypto tokens may be up this week is that Congress is set to debate and possibly vote on a various key pieces of legislation that are seen as advancing Trump&#8217;s crypto-friendly agenda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <em>Bloomberg</em> reports, the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-14/bitcoin-hits-record-high-of-120-000-as-bullish-momentum-builds\">actions are being dubbed</a> &#8220;Crypto Week.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The legislation includes the Senate&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91353315/senate-expected-pass-crypto-bill-without-addressing-trumps-investments\">GENIUS Act</a>, which would create a regulatory framework for a dollar-pegged stablecoin. It also includes the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025\u2014aka the <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/economy/will-congress-finally-start-regulating-cryptocurrency-marketplace\">Clarity Act</a>\u2014which aims to create a framework for digital assets more broadly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Potential crypto-related movement on Capitol Hill comes in addition to growing institutional demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as <em>Fast Company</em> <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91366551/bitcoin-price-today-120000-why-btc-up-crypto-rally-explained\">reported</a> last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add it all up and you have a lot of enthusiasm at the moment for Bitcoin and its fellow cryptocurrencies all the way down the chain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, it&#8217;s important to keep in mind that we&#8217;ve been here before. In late 2021, Bitcoin was riding high on what was then a record price, somewhere just north of $64,000. It came crashing down in the wake of numerous crypto scandals and the ensuing &#8220;Crypto Winter&#8221; of 2022. It took more than two years to recover.</p>",

We expect capital that was previously sidelined due to regulatory uncertainty to re-enter,&#8221; said Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at crypto exchange Bitfinex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Crypto week&#8221; also comes as bitcoin has <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91366551/bitcoin-price-today-120000-why-btc-up-crypto-rally-explained\">scaled record highs</a> in recent days as investors dive back into risk assets on the back of tariff-related news, as well as expectations that legislation could potentially unlock capital in the crypto space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big ticket item the House is set to vote on this week is a bill that would create a set of federal requirements for stablecoins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant value, usually a 1:1 dollar peg, are commonly used by crypto traders to move funds between tokens. Their use has grown rapidly in recent years, and proponents say they could be used to send payments instantly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, received bipartisan support in the Senate, with several Democrats joining most Republicans to back the proposed federal rules. It is expected to pass the House and would then head to Trump, who has said he will sign it into law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill would require tokens to be backed by liquid assets\u2014such as U.S. dollars and short-term Treasury bills\u2014and for issuers to disclose publicly the composition of their reserves on a monthly basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto proponents say those rules could legitimize stablecoins, making banks, retailers and consumers more comfortable with using them to transfer funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of the bill&#8217;s final passage, many companies across sectors are already considering how they might incorporate stablecoins into their business, said Julia Demidova, head of digital currencies product and strategy at FIS, a financial technology solutions provider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think everyone is realizing, look, this is moving forward and they need to have a stablecoin strategy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They need to think how banks themselves will position against some of these novel, new, emerging fintech-issued stablecoins as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, many Democrats have argued that the GENIUS Act would not prevent big tech companies from issuing their own private stablecoins, and have called for stronger anti-money laundering protections and prohibitions on foreign stablecoin issuers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Democrats fiercely oppose both the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, arguing that they have too few consumer protections and would be a giveaway to Trump&#8217;s own personal crypto ventures by enabling softer-touch regulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democratic members are expected to offer several amendments to both the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act on the House floor next week, according to a source familiar with the matter, but it is unclear whether any of them will be considered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The House will also vote next week on a bill that would prohibit the U.S. from issuing a central bank digital currency, which Republicans say violate Americans&#8217; privacy. The bill has not been considered in the Senate and the Federal Reserve has not indicated a desire to develop a central bank digital currency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-market-structure\">MARKET STRUCTURE</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The House this week is also expected to pass a bill that aims to develop a regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies and would expand the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&#8217;s oversight of the digital asset industry and is backed by the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If signed into law, the bill would define when a cryptocurrency is a security or a commodity and clarify the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s jurisdiction over the sector, something crypto companies heavily disputed during the Biden administration. That could help crypto companies avoid the oversight of the SEC, which under the Biden administration sued a number of crypto exchanges for flouting its rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto companies have argued that most crypto tokens should be classified as commodities, rather than securities, which would enable platforms to more easily offer those tokens to their customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That bill, called the CLARITY Act, has yet to be considered in the Senate, where it would need to pass before heading to Trump for final approval.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has sought to overhaul U.S. cryptocurrency policies after courting cash from the industry during his presidential campaign. The sector spent more than $119 million backing pro-crypto congressional candidates in last year&#8217;s elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump&#8217;s crypto ventures include a meme coin called $TRUMP, launched in January, and a business called World Liberty Financial, a crypto company owned partly by the president.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The White House has said there are no conflicts of interest and that Trump&#8217;s assets are in a trust managed by his children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u2014Hannah Lang, Reuters</em></p>",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91353507/why-kraft-heinz-is-ditching-artificial-food-dyes-and-whats-driving-the-change\">Kraft Heinz</a> is studying a potential spin off of a large chunk of its <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/grocery-stores\">grocery business</a>, including many Kraft products, into a new entity that could be valued at as much as $20 billion on its own, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the structure of the deal could change and there is no guarantee Kraft Heinz would move forward with any such deal, the source said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>News of the potential move is the second effort this week by a storied U.S. company looking to shore up shareholder value as shoppers ditch their pricey products in an uncertain economy. Earlier this week, cereal maker <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91366095/ferrero-wk-kellogg\">WK Kellogg agreed to a $3.1 billion buyout deal</a> from Italy&#8217;s Ferrero.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wall Street Journal first reported the development earlier in the day. According to the report, a split, which would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, could be finalized in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,&#8221; a company spokesperson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its shares closed up 2.5%. The company currently has a market value of $31.33 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz, which they bought in 2013. But it has been a challenging investment for Berkshire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inflationary pressures and a shift in focus toward fresher, less processed food have hurt demand for Kraft Heinz&#8217;s lunch combos and other products. It lowered annual forecasts and reported a dour quarter in April, hurt by muted consumer spending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kraft Heinz also said last month it would stop the launch of new products with artificial colors in the U.S. after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. outlined plans to remove synthetic food dyes from the U.S. food supply to address chronic diseases and conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;KHC spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kellogg spinoff in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time,&#8221; said Connor Rattigan, analyst at Consumer Edge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As CPGs (consumer packaged goods makers) contend with both changing consumer preferences and a challenging consumer environment, other CPGs may look to M&amp;A and or similar corporate actions to improve their category exposures and improve their top-line trajectory,&#8221; Rattigan said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u2014Anuja Bharat Mistry, Juveria Tabassum, Abigail Summerville, and Neil J.

    "description": "About 20 years ago, the Russian state began a large-scale operation to take control of Orthodox parishes all over Europe.\u00a0Some of these had, over time, broken ties with the Moscow patriarchate. They're now the object of legal cases pitting the Russian Federation against local associations created to run these expatriate churches during the Soviet era. In April, a court in the French city of Nice ruled that a church and historic cemetery there rightfully belonged to Russia, rather than to the local cultural association. For some of its parishioners, seeing the French justice system side with the country waging war against Ukraine has been hard to accept. Descendants of the Russian tsars, on the other hand, welcome this decision.\u00a0FRANCE 24's Elena Volochine reports.",

    "description": "<p>KFC is calling Colonel Sanders back into service as the ailing restaurant brand navigates what it calls a \u201cKentucky Fried comeback.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, the fast-food restaurant chain kicked off a national television <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv8NRl-C3WA\">ad campaign</a> featuring the return of Colonel Sanders that highlights the brand\u2019s origin story in an attempt to lure back diners who have gravitated to the sector\u2019s largest players, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/chick-fil-a\">Chick-fil-A</a> and Restaurant Brands\u2019 Popeyes, and smaller upstarts like Dave\u2019s Hot Chicken. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While those chains have reported steady sales growth, restaurant operator Yum Brands has reported KFC\u2019s U.S. sales have declined for five consecutive quarters.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe kind of lost a bit of ground,\u201d says Catherine Tan-Gillespie, president of KFC\u2019s U.S. business, during an interview with <em>Fast Company</em>. \u201cThis is about us getting back in the fight.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>KFC\u2019s positioning has gotten so wobbly that it was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/30/raising-canes-how-it-beat-kfc-to-become-no-3-chicken-chain.html\">recently ousted</a> from the top three largest chicken chains in the U.S. by sales by Raising Cane\u2019s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smaller chains like Slim Chickens and Dave\u2019s Hot Chicken have been accelerating their new restaurant openings and have had more success with narrowly focused menus. Growth for Dave\u2019s Hot Chicken became so appetizing that it recently secured a majority investment from private equity firm Roark Capital at a <a href=\"https://www.qsrmagazine.com/story/roark-capital-investment-adds-sizzle-to-daves-hot-chickens-explosive-growth-plans/\">$1 billion valuation</a>, even though the chain had just over 300 locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cChicken is the world\u2019s protein and it\u2019s the only protein that can be eaten globally,\u201d says Fred LeFranc, founder and CEO at restaurant consulting firm Results Thru Strategy. \u201cBut, it\u2019s very, very competitive.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bones-of-contention\">Bones of contention </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the legacy incumbent brand, KFC has struggled with a menu that tends to favor bone-in chicken, while much of the growth has been for boneless chicken in the forms of tenders, nuggets, and sandwiches. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The quality of service at KFC isn\u2019t as well regarded as it is at rivals like Chick-fil-A, which puts a huge emphasis on friendliness from the staff, and the operating standards for stores has also been low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey let their stores get old and didn\u2019t refurbish them,\u201d adds LeFranc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tan-Gillespie concedes that legacy brands like KFC \u201csometimes do lose ground if they lose touch with where customers are evolving or where competitors are intensifying.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91367361\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-1-91367349-kfc-colonel-sanders-comeback.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: KFC]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A 10-year veteran at KFC, including leadership roles in Canada and the South Pacific markets and serving as a chief <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketing</a> officer for the U.S. business, Tan-Gillespie was promoted to the role of president in April to steer a turnaround. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Yum Brands, it is key to get the chicken restaurant chain back on track to align more with the healthier sales results that have been reported by the operator\u2019s other two big brands, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her comeback plan for KFC includes retraining staff and a longer-term investment to renovate stores. KFC intends to use some corporate locations to experiment and evaluate what the restaurant concept of the future will look like.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>KFC is also giving a lot more attention to the food it serves, adding original recipe chicken tenders and a chicken-and-waffles combo to the menu. This week, KFC will add fried dill pickle slices, a trendy menu item that\u2019s also recently been featured at Popeyes and Shake Shack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chain is also promoting a \u201cfree bucket on us\u201d digital offer, available on KFC.com and the company\u2019s mobile app, which will give diners a free bucket of fried chicken for orders over $15.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-famous-mascot-gets-a-fresh-start\">Famous mascot gets a fresh start</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the return of Colonel Sanders, in the past, KFC relied on a long-running gimmick of <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/hiring\" title=\"Hiring\">hiring</a> big named celebrities to play the character, including <em>Saturday Night Live</em> alums Darrell Hammond and Norm Macdonald, actor Rob Lowe, and country singer Reba McEntire. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those advertisements were successful in breaking through culturally, but Tan-Gillespie says the latest campaign has a different goal of focusing more on the food and less on a casting gimmick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t necessarily want a celebrity to detract from that story,\u201d says Tan-Gillespie. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The newest ad does feature a celebrity component, with Canadian chef and <em>The Bear</em> actor Matty Matheson interacting with the Colonel in a few brief moments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>KFC\u2019s campaign will also run on social media channels including <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/tiktok\" title=\"TikTok\">TikTok</a> and Instagram, as well as out-of-home advertising. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was developed by KFC\u2019s team with support from external partners including the creative agency Highdive, whose work in food includes campaigns for Mentos candy, Lay\u2019s potato chips, and the sandwich restaurant chain Jersey Mike\u2019s Subs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tan-Gillespie says all of the elements of the campaign reflect a dual approach that she calls \u201csales overnight and brand over time.\u201d </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What that means is she hopes KFC can emotionally connect with diners with the return of a beloved brand mascot, while also driving more immediate sales with promotions and new menu items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe return of the Colonel, in many ways, equals the return of KFC,\u201d says Tan-Gillespie.</p>",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91352117/women-have-been-slower-to-adapt-ai-at-work-heres-why-women-work-ai",
    "description": "<p>As a leader in technology for nearly 30 years, I have observed waves of innovation disrupt the global business landscape and trigger major shifts in the way we work. Now, as <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> takes its place as the next big thing, the global workforce is facing an overwhelming demand for new skills and capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my new book, <a href=\"https://www.koganpage.com/digital-technology/artificial-intelligence-for-business-9781398618008\"><em>Artificial Intelligence For Business</em></a>, I highlight the impact of AI on the future of work, specifically the skills gaps and job displacements, as well as future essential skills required in global organizations. Interestingly, there is a cautious instinct at play, specifically for women at work, as they weigh the promise of innovation with the risks of AI application. This hesitation may be deterring women from using AI at work, as worries about embracing AI could undermine their credibility or even invite harsher judgement, instead of highlighting their true potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=66548\">recent research</a> conducted by Harvard Business School Associate Professor Rembrand Koning, women are adopting AI tools at a 25% lower rate than men, on average. Synthesizing data from 18 studies that cover over 140,000 individuals worldwide, combined with estimates of the gender share of the hundreds of millions of users of popular generative AI platforms, the research demonstrates the gender gap holds across all regions, sectors, and occupations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the study highlights that closing this gap is crucial for business and economic growth, and development of AI-based technologies that avoid bias, the reasons for the gap existing in the first place needs to be explored further. Let\u2019s unpack several ethical, reputational, and systemic hurdles that may lead women to be more reluctant to use AI at work and explore how companies can help bridge this gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ethical-concerns\">Ethical concerns</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, ethical concerns of AI adoption tend to weigh heavily on women\u2019s minds. Studies indicate that women consistently rate hesitation about AI technology adoption higher than men do, placing greater weight on ethics, transparency, accountability, explainability, and fairness when evaluating AI tools. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44163-025-00235-7\">In one study</a> that examines public perceptions of AI fairness across three societal U.S.-based contexts, personal life, work life, and public life, women consistently perceived AI as less beneficial and more harmful across all contexts. This caution may be evident as women hold themselves, and their teams, to strong ethical standards. These concerns are amplified by the rapid increase in &#8220;black box&#8221; AI tools adoption across key business decision points, where the inner workings are opaque and hidden behind proprietary algorithms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As more female ethicists and policy experts enter the global field, they raise high-impact questions about bias, data privacy, and harmful consequences, feeling a special responsibility to get answers before signing off on innovative technology solutions. Women all over the world watched in dismay as leading AI ethicists were penalized for raising valid concerns over ethical development and use of AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Famously, Timnit Gebru, co-lead of Google\u2019s Ethical AI team, was forced out after pushing back on orders to withdraw her paper on the social risks of large language models. Subsequently, Margaret Mitchell was also fired while standing in solidarity with Gebru and raising similar concerns. This move, among others, has sent a stark message that calling out potential harm in AI could make you a target.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-extra-scrutiny\">Extra scrutiny</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside ethics, there is may be a fear of being judged at work for leaning on AI tools. In my experience, women often face extra scrutiny over their skills, capabilities, and technical prowess. There may be a deep-rooted concern that leveraging AI tools may be perceived as cutting corners or reflect poorly on the users\u2019 skill level. That reputational risk may be magnified when flaws or issues in the AI outputs are attributed to the user\u2019s lack of competence or expertise. Layer onto this a host of ongoing systemic challenges inherent in the business environment and AI tools that are implemented. For example, training data can under-represent the experiences of women in the workplace and reinforce the perception that AI products were not built for them. Nondiverse AI teams also pose as a deterrent, creating additional barriers to participate and engage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The consequence of the gender gap in AI is more than a discomfort. It can result in AI systems that reinforce gender stereotypes and ignore inequities, issues that are augmented when AI tools are applied for decision-making across essential areas such as <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/hiring\" title=\"Hiring\">hiring</a>, performance reviews, and career development. For example, a recruitment tool trained on historical data may limit female candidates from leadership roles, not due to lack of capabilities, but because historically there have been more male leaders. Blind spots like these further deepen the very gap that organizations are trying to close.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To counter this and encourage more women to use AI at work, organizations should start by creating an environment that balances guardrails with exploration. Additionally, they should build psychological safety by encouraging dialogue that gives space for concerns, challenges, and feedback, without fears of being penalized. Open and transparent communication addresses any expected fears and uncertainty that accompany AI use in the workplace. Build fail-safe sandbox environments for exploration, where the goal is to learn through trial and error and develop skills through experiential learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-policy-changes\">Policy changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing policy and guidelines in the organization can prove effective in encouraging more women to use AI at work. Apart from clear guidelines around responsible AI use, policies specifically allowing the use of AI can help close the gap. In a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4759218\">study conducted by the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH)</a>, male students were less likely to view using AI as &#8220;cheating.&#8221; Additionally, when policies forbid the use of AI, male students tended to use it anyway, while women adhered to the policy. When a policy explicitly allowing the use of AI was put in place, over 80% of both men and women used it, suggesting that policies encouraging the use of AI can help trigger more women to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crucially, organizations should make a proactive effort to bring in more women into the AI conversation at every level. Diverse perspectives can prove effective in catching blind spots, and this approach sends a powerful message that representation matters. When women see their peers proactively shaping AI application in a safe, fair, and impactful way, they will feel more confident in participating as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91356470/johnny-mnemonic-predicted-our-addictive-digital-future",
    "description": "<p>In the mid-1990s, Hollywood began trying to envision the internet (sometimes called the \u201cinformation superhighway\u201d) and its implications for life and culture. Some of its attempts have aged better than others. Perhaps the most thoughtful is the 1995 film <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113481/\">Johnny Mnemonic</a></em>, the screenplay for which was written by cyberpunk pioneer William Gibson, based on his 1981 short story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film tells the story of Johnny (played by Keanu Reeves), whose vocation is couriering large amounts of data uploaded to a digital memory bank installed in his brain. As Johnny is asked to carry more and more data, his memory bank crowds out or burns away his own organic memories. Desperate to earn enough for a brain operation to restore them, he agrees to a final, dangerously large data haul that may cost him his life. <em>Johnny Mnemonic</em> brought Gibson\u2019s projections of our online future to millions who might never have encountered them in his books.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A fan of Gibson\u2019s books (especially <em>Neuromancer</em>), I remember watching the movie in the mid-2000s and thinking that its effort to visualize and expand the world of the short story felt plasticky and forced. Critics at the time saw something similar, with <em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/26/movies/film-review-too-much-on-his-mind-ready-to-go-blooey.html\">calling it</a> \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and \u201cvisually garish,\u201d <em>Variety</em> <a href=\"https://variety.com/1995/film/reviews/johnny-mnemonic-2-1200441609/\">condemning it</a> as a \u201cconfused mess of sci-fi clich\u00e9s,\u201d and Roger Ebert <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/johnny-mnemonic-1995\">awarding it</a> just two out of four stars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in 2025, <em>Johnny Mnemonic</em> hits me differently. The internet is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/04/30/1172276538/world-wide-web-internet-anniversary\">30-some years old</a>, and many of Gibson\u2019s most prescient ideas have now been more fully realized. If <em>Johnny Mnemonic</em> got some of the details wrong, its larger metaphorical themes of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/the-rise-of-the-internet-addiction-industry/414031/\">tech addiction</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-responsibility-of-immortality/\">transhumanism</a>, and our <a href=\"https://fortune.com/well/article/screen-time-over-lifespan/\">drift toward digital spaces</a> have only become more clear. I think Gibson was feeling the zeitgeist of a future moment when we all have to decide how much of our organic lives we\u2019re willing to give away as our digital lives grow larger.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story is part of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/1995-week\">1995 Week</a>, where we\u2019ll revisit some of the most interesting, unexpected, and confounding developments in tech 30 years ago.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This tension between digital and organic memory arguably began at the turn of the century, when Google established itself as the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90857887/what-chatgpt-says-about-google-25th-anniversary\">de facto directory</a> of the information available online. Suddenly, we had access to a vast public store of shared knowledge, data, and content. Studies soon showed that people were forgoing committing information to (organic) memory because they knew it was readily available via Google. Researchers from Columbia, Harvard, and the University of Wisconsin discovered the &#8220;Google Effect\u201d in a <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1207745\">2011 study</a>, which showed that people are far more likely to remember where data is stored than the actual data itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Increasingly, the value of consumer tech products seems to be measured by their ability to addict\u2014by how much of the user\u2019s time and brain space they can claim. Addiction hijacks the brain, reserving more and more time and attention for the object of desire. Every major technology wave in the last three decades has resulted in increased dependency on digital devices and content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile phones proved remarkably addictive. A number of <a href=\"https://explodingtopics.com/blog/smartphone-usage-stats\">recent studies</a> peg our daily use at between 3.5 and 4.5 hours per day. Pew Research <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/01/31/americans-use-of-mobile-technology-and-home-broadband/\">found in early 2024</a> that 16- to 24-year-olds (tomorrow\u2019s adults) often spend more than six hours a day looking at their smartphones. Numerous studies have shown strong correlations between smartphone addiction and mental and physical health problems, including anxiety, depression, poor sleep, and academic struggles. Mobile phone makers have been forced to add features to help people moderate their screen time, but usage continues to rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40419606/lessons-from-the-epic-rise-fall-of-the-facebook-of-the-1990s\">social media revolution in the 2010s</a> introduced highly addictive digital spaces where almost three-fourths of Americans now spend an average of 2 hours and 10 minutes per day (and that\u2019s just a third of their total online time). The addictiveness was and is a feature, not a bug. \u201cThe thought process that went into building these applications . . . was all about: \u2018How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?\u2019\u201d Facebook founding president Sean Parker <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/sean-parker-facebook-was-designed-to-exploit-human-vulnerability-1513306782\">said at an Axios event</a> in 2017. Congress has introduced several bills to restrict addictive design, but none have passed. In the mid-2010s, Facebook discovered that angry, hyperpartisan content was even more potent catnip for keeping people scrolling and posting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 2020s, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/tiktok\" title=\"TikTok\">TikTok</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> algorithm set a new standard for addictiveness. It processes thousands of signals indicating a user\u2019s tastes and beliefs to serve a tailor-fit stream of short videos designed to keep them swiping. The app reached 2.05 billion users worldwide in 2024, with users <a href=\"https://electroiq.com/stats/average-time-spent-on-tiktok-statistics\">averaging around an hour</a> per day. A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/12/12/teens-social-media-and-technology-2024/\">2024 Pew Research report</a> found that about 58% of U.S. teens use TikTok daily, including 17% who said they use it \u201calmost constantly.\u201d These tech waves build on each other. Internet usage increased with mobile devices; mobile usage increased with the social web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generative AI apps may prove even more addictive and intrusive. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT is the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/\">fastest-growing consumer app</a> in history, amassing 100 million users just two months after launching in late November 2022, and 500 million weekly active users by March 2025. ChatGPT generates everything from computer code and companionship to custom images and video. Internet sites and social platforms no longer rely strictly on human-created content\u2014they\u2019ll soon generate much of it using AI. This might be a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91279582/ai-companions-the-future-of-friendship-or-a-dangerous-illusion\">personalized companion</a>, a business coach, or even a version of a loved one who\u2019s gone, like the ghostly AI character who advises Johnny in the film. This is likely to further increase the share of our time spent in digital spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These technologies capture our brains by capturing our attention, but the tech industry is already developing devices that capture space in our physical bodies\u2014just like Johnny\u2019s memory bank. Neuralink\u2019s brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/neuralink-implant-first-human-patient-demonstration/\">implanted in the brain</a> and can translate brain activity to communicate with external tech devices. In the near future, we may choose to use such interfaces to augment our brains with specialized knowledge bases or connect \u201cmemory prosthetics\u201d that allow us to store, retrieve, or even offload memories digitally. Some in AI circles even believe the only way humans can stay relevant in the age of AI is by integrating AI models with their brains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Human\u2013computer fusion is a major theme in Gibson\u2019s work. In <em>Neuromancer</em> (arguably Gibson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24086056/apple-tv-plus-neuromancer-streaming-series-william-gibson\">most revered book</a>), the protagonist Case has a bodyguard/sidekick named Molly who has implanted cybernetic eyes that see in the dark, display data to her, and improve her spatial vision during fights. His characters often use \u201cdermal sockets\u201d in the skull behind the ear to gain new skills (like operating weapons or vehicles). Case and Johnny use these neural interfaces to plug their brains and nervous systems into an alternative, digital world referred to as \u201ccyberspace\u201d or \u201cthe matrix.\u201d The best-known description of this realm comes from <em>Neuromancer</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cA consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation . . . A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the decades after <em>Johnny</em> <em>Mnemonic</em>, tech companies would invest heavily in <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91269074/augmented-virtual-reality-most-innovative-companies-2025\">developing virtual reality spaces</a> for both consumers and businesses. Companies like Second Life, Microsoft, Magic Leap, Oculus Rift, and more recently Meta and Apple, have taken up the chase. But so far, the tech industry\u2019s attempts at creating entertaining, social, and functional digital spaces have failed to go mainstream. After Facebook <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/07/whats-next-for-metas-metaverse.html\">sunk billions</a> into building the \u201cmetaverse\u201d\u2014even <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90973790/facebook-rebrand-as-meta-2-years-later\">appropriating part of the term</a> as its company name\u2014mainstream consumers decided it wasn\u2019t the new digital \u201ctown square\u201d and not a place they wanted to spend their time. But that was mainly due to shortcomings in the hardware and software, not a cultural rejection (like with video phones or Google Glass). As extended reality (XR) hardware gets smaller, more powerful, and more comfortable, and digital experiences become more believable, XR could yet go mainstream. It could still become another wave of addictive technology that traps users in digital space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gibson\u2019s presentation of technology in <em>Johnny</em> <em>Mnemonic</em> betrays an awareness of its addictive qualities. Johnny\u2019s last and biggest courier job looks like a drug deal. He meets a crew of Chinese underworld figures in a Beijing hotel room to pick up the data. The upload procedure itself, with its careful assortment of digital paraphernalia, smacks of an allegory to administering a dangerous drug like heroin. Because Johnny lacked enough space in his memory bank for the data, his post-upload reaction looks like an overdose. His body shakes. He grinds his teeth. He perspires heavily. After staggering to the bathroom, he\u2019s physically jolted by hallucinatory flashes of the data as it bursts through the limits of his memory bank and into his brain. Staring into the mirror, he discovers his nose is bleeding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, Johnny\u2019s love interest, Jane (Dina Meyer) is shown to suffer from a tech-related disease. She has a system of interconnected contact points on her inner forearm\u2014like the track marks of a junkie. She suffers from a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0ff8MAoWV8&amp;pp=ygUTam9obm55IG1uZW1vbmljIE5BUw%3D%3D\">condition called NAS</a> (nerve attenuation syndrome), or the \u201cblack shakes,\u201d a neurological disorder caused by overexposure to computers and other electronics. Asked for the cause of NAS, Henry Rollins\u2019s Spider character (an anti-corporate activist and underground cybernetic doctor) gestures around at all the electronic equipment in his lab and huffs: \u201cAll this . . . technological civilization, but we still have all this shit &#8216;cuz we can\u2019t live without it!\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the film, an associate named J-Bone (Ice-T) informs Johnny that the data he\u2019s carrying is actually the cure for NAS, complete with clinical trials data, and the property of a big pharma multinational. The company, Pharmakom Industries, had been hiding the cure from the public to continue selling drug treatments for the disease\u2019s symptoms. That too has a <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/12/11/unitedhealthcare-manifesto-luigi-mangione-elisabeth-rosenthal-michael-moore\">prophetic ring</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, I already reserve a large part of my cognitive capacity for my online, digital life. Most of us do, and we\u2019re already shouldering a heavy cognitive load of digital information\u2014and paying for it. We\u2019re more <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed.aspx\">stressed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db527.htm\">depressed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf\">isolated</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13049-9\">lonely</a>. As digital devices like Neuralink bring the digital world <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91029453/unpacking-the-ethical-issues-swirling-around-neuralink\">even closer to our brains</a>, the side effects may become more visceral. By giving up part of his brain to someone else\u2019s data, Johnny gave up part of his memories. He gave up part of his identity\u2014part of himself. At times, as data burst from the limits of his memory bank, pieces of it flashed in his mind like broken images and mingled with flashes of his own, real memories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One day, an AI implant may introduce a foreign intelligence into our brains that mixes with our organic, \u201cearned\u201d knowledge and experience. Did Johnny ever wonder where the digital part of him ended and his real self began? Will we?</p>",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91364041/tokenized-stok-trading-platforms-robinhood",
    "description": "<p>Robinhood cofounder and CEO Vlad Tenev channeled Hollywood glamour last month in Cannes at an extravagantly produced event unveiling of the trading platform\u2019s newest products, including a tokenized shares offering designed to give investors exposure to private companies like SpaceX and OpenAI, as well as public companies like Microsoft and Nvidia. For crypto enthusiasts, it was a watershed moment: A <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91270856/robinhood-most-innovative-companies-2025\">major trading platform</a> was finally breaking down the barriers between traditional equities and blockchain technologies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe time is now for crypto to move beyond Bitcoin and memecoins and introduce fundamental utility,\u201d Tenev told Bloomberg Television. \u201cWe think, in the future, crypto and traditional financial services will fully merge, and crypto will become the infrastructure layer behind all kinds of financial services.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Tenev\u2019s moment of triumph was short-lived. First, OpenAI cautioned Robinhood customers to \u201cbe careful,\u201d<a href=\"https://x.com/OpenAINewsroom/status/1940502391037874606\"> noting on X</a> that tokenized shares are \u201cnot OpenAI equity.\u201d Then, this week, the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s cryptocurrency task force leader released a statement saying that \u201ctokenized securities are still securities.\u201d While the statement did not represent an official shift in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) policy, it did <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/business/sec-crypto-tokenized-securities.html\">serve as a signal </a>that U.S. regulators are monitoring tokenization with a critical eye. (For now, Robinhood\u2019s tokenized shares are only available in Europe.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the controversy, at least half a dozen companies are racing to develop tokenized versions of traditional equities. Here\u2019s what you need to know:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-tokenized-shares-nbsp\">What are tokenized shares?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tokenized shares are digital versions of stocks or other securities that mimic the valuation of the real-world version. They give buyers exposure to the traditional equities without giving them governance rights. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-they-work-nbsp\">How do they work?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tokenized shares can work one of two ways: In the first case, the trading platform acquires shares in a company, and then issues tokens for those shares. There is a one-to-one relationship between the underlying shares held by the trading platform and the tokens that the platform issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second case, the trading platform issues tokens without acquiring any underlying shares, while promising to tie the value of its token to the real-world security\u2019s value. The onus here is on the trading platform to be able to cover any gains through its own investment and hedging strategies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robinhood has said it will own the shares backing its tokens and will provide token holders with benefits including dividends.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-which-trading-platforms-are-offering-tokenized-shares-nbsp\">Which trading platforms are offering tokenized shares?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the leading crypto trading platforms, including Coinbase and Kraken, are in the process of developing tokenized shares. Coinbase is still in talks with the SEC, while Kraken launched its xStocks product, which includes over 50 U.S. equities, in select non-U.S. markets in May. Kraken backs its xStocks one-to-one with traditional equities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republic, an investment platform known for its private market and crowdfunding solutions, is calling its tokenized shares \u201cmirror tokens\u201d and is currently operating a waitlist for unicorns including SpaceX, Anthropic, and Ramp. It\u2019s capping investor participation at $5,000, and does not plan to acquire shares.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not buying a SPV [special purpose vehicle] interest in SpaceX,\u201d says Mario Lattuga, Republic\u2019s head of legal. \u201cWhat you&#8217;re doing is, you want to participate in that prospective upside. And it&#8217;s as much of a bet on Republic as it is on that \u2018underlying\u2019 company.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jarsy, founded by former Facebook and Uber executive Han Qin, is one of several younger startups focused on tokenized shares. Jarsy closed its $5 million seed round last month.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-the-argument-in-favor-of-tokenization-nbsp\">What is the argument in favor of tokenization?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Proponents of tokenization view it as a way to increase access to private markets and modernize public markets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.S., only accredited investors are allowed to invest in private companies\u2014and even for accredited investors, it\u2019s extraordinarily difficult to buy shares of a unicorn like SpaceX. Younger generations of investors, in particular, see the opportunity to get in early on future unicorns as important to their financial success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In parallel, proponents of public company tokenization view the model as a way to increase markets\u2019 speed, efficiency, accessibility, and cost. Robinhood is aiming to demonstrate those benefits by making its tokenized shares tradable 24 hours a day, five days a week. Over time, Robinhood aims to eliminate even blockchain middlemen and run token trading on its own infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-the-risks-associated-with-tokenization-nbsp\">What are the risks associated with tokenization?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For companies, token markets have the potential to undermine control. A private company raising a fundraising round, for example, might struggle to convince investors of its target strike price if the company\u2019s tokens are trading at a lower price.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For retail investors, there are a multitude of risks, which can vary depending on the specific terms being offered by the trading platform. Some platforms are imposing liquidity constraints, for example. Plus, there has been no official rulemaking around the products, making it unclear what recourse will be available to investors in the event of a trading platform\u2019s collapse or other potential problems.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-regulators-saying-about-tokenized-shares-nbsp\">What are regulators saying about tokenized shares?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The S.E.C.\u2019s crypto task force held a hearing on tokenization in May. Hester Pierce, the task force\u2019s leader and an S.E.C. commissioner, indicated in her recent statements that tokenized shares should be treated as securities, or tradable financial instruments, which would make them subject to government oversight. She also noted that the S.E.C. was also willing to collaborate with trading platforms. \u201cWe stand ready to work with market participants to craft appropriate exemptions and modernize rules,\u201d she said. For now, though, the products are in the same kind of regulatory limbo that has plagued some aspects of crypto for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-this-the-first-time-that-platforms-have-tried-to-make-a-go-of-it-with-tokenized-equities-nbsp\">Is this the first time that platforms have tried to make a go of it with tokenized equities?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No. In 2021, crypto exchange Binance launched tokenized U.S. stocks, including for Apple and Tesla. But Binance scrubbed the effort just months later, after regulators balked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-has-openai-been-the-most-vocal-in-its-resistance-to-tokenization-nbsp\">Why has OpenAI been the most vocal in its resistance to tokenization?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenAI\u2019s famously complex corporate structure may play a role in its cautionary tone. Startup Jarsy, for example, does not plan to list OpenAI tokens. Jarsy could have tried to acquire OpenAI preferred shares through an existing investor, but decided to pass because of the risks associated with tying tokens to a company with a murky governance structure. \u201cOpenAI is a nonprofit company; the shares they\u2019re offering are not exactly shares,\u201d says Qin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-are-so-many-companies-launching-tokenized-shares-now-nbsp\">Why are so many companies launching tokenized shares now?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump administration is seen as crypto-friendly. If Trump\u2019s SEC allows tokenized shares to move forward, it could be difficult for a future administration to walk the decision back.&nbsp;</p>",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91364671/ceo-security-keep-company-leaders-safe",
    "description": "<p><em>Hello and welcome to </em>Modern CEO<em>! I\u2019m Stephanie Mehta, CEO and chief content officer of Mansueto Ventures. Each week this newsletter explores inclusive approaches to leadership drawn from conversations with executives and entrepreneurs, and from the pages of</em> Inc. <em>and </em>Fast Company<em>. If you received this newsletter from a friend, you can <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/newsletters\">sign up to get it yourself</a> every Monday morning</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prominent CEOs and high-net-worth individuals have long had security details, but in recent months executive security feels like it has become a more conspicuous part of the corporate landscape. It is no longer unusual to see a CEO\u2019s protection officer standing nearby during lunch in a restaurant. I\u2019ve had a growing number of companies request a \u201csweep\u201d of our office before a CEO visits <em>Fast Company</em> or<em> Inc</em>., and I\u2019ve seen leaders arrive at meetings in bulletproof vehicles, even after traveling just a few blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This rise in CEO security isn\u2019t just anecdotal: More than a third (34.4%) of S&amp;P 500 companies offered executive security in 2024, according to a fresh analysis of 2025 proxy statements by intelligence firm Equilar, up from 28.2% in 2023. Median security spending last year increased to $105,749, up 6% from a year earlier, with some companies, such as Intel, boosting security spending more than 8,000%, to $250,000 from just $3,000 in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And security spending is likely to climb in 2025 following the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024. Experts say heightened security resources correlate to a rise in credible threats against executives, fomented by political rhetoric, social media, and antibusiness sentiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bodyguards-for-the-top-boss\">Bodyguards for the top boss</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even for public company CEOs, the level and visibility of their security operations vary wildly based on their fame and circumstances. Meta provides CEO Mark Zuckerberg with a $14 million annual pretax allowance to protect him and his family, up from $10 million in 2018. \u201cWe believe that Mr. Zuckerberg&#8217;s role puts him in a unique position: He is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,\u201d the company says in its 2025 proxy statement. In contrast, Berkshire Hathaway last year spent $305,111 on in-home and personal security services for its equally high-profile but relatively unprovocative CEO, Warren Buffett.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most CEOs are initially reluctant to embrace protection. \u201cUsually, CEOs think everything\u2019s fine,\u201d says Paul Donahue, president, global security services at Constellis, which provides security services and support. When they do concede to security, chief executives can be very selective about the professionals who guard them. \u201cWe tell all of our executive protection folks, \u2018CEOs operate at a very high speed, they\u2019re highly demanding, and they\u2019re as particular in picking security as they are in picking a plane they\u2019re buying,\u2019 so we\u2019ve had a lot of turnover,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Constellis recruits ex-military, ex-law enforcement, and career security professionals to work in its executive protection unit. Donahue says those careers instill people with the skills, including discipline and an understanding of chain of command, needed to succeed in the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Protecting a CEO can be a balancing act: Security professionals need to be able to say no to clients, especially when a seemingly simple request, like running out to pick up a pint of ice cream, might require Constellis to put together a patrol team and mobilize several cars. \u201cBut if they insist, we&#8217;ll go to H\u00e4agen-Dazs at 11 p.m.,\u201d Donanue says. \u201cIt&#8217;s as personal a service as I think there is.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should companies invest in CEO security? While the odds of an incident are fairly low, Donahue argues (self-servingly) that it is money well spent. He notes that the Thompson killing unleashed a wave of negative sentiment about United Healthcare and the health insurance industry, damaging the company\u2019s reputation and hurting employee morale. Furthermore, he says, if companies spend millions of dollars guarding intellectual property, products, and brands, they should feel comfortable earmarking a couple hundred thousand dollars for CEO protection. \u201cIf you truly believe your most important asset is your people, which we hear over and over, you probably should spend a little more on protecting that important asset,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-you-protect-yourself\">How do you protect yourself?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CEOs, how are you thinking about personal security?

Some of its other flavors have already made the change, with the remainder of its portfolio transitioning next year. But the road to get here was anything but quick or easy for the company\u2014despite having its own food science team in-house.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, it\u2019s been a 10-year process, the company says, adding that it couldn\u2019t have possibly reacted rapidly to the demands of the new administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt happens that all this coalesced just as the MAGA movement was really intensifying, but that&#8217;s just pure coincidence,\u201d says Rosenberg. \u201cBecause we started working on this before any of this ever was even on anybody&#8217;s radar screen.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Two small groups of fruit snacks on a white table arranged side-by-side.

But their use has still prompted legitimate health concerns <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23026007/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">from researchers</a>. The synthetic dyes used in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63606676/food-dye-additives-united-states-vs-europe/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">aren\u2019t actually banned in Europe</a>, but since 2010 manufacturers <a href=\"https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2010/07/eu-places-warning-labels-on-foods-containing-dyes/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">have had to place a warning label</a> on foods in the region using them. Manufacturers have tried to avoid using these warnings, so their versions of products <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1k6inay/a_bowl_of_european_fruit_loops_top_compared_to_a/#lightbox\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">like Fruit Loops</a> often eliminate artificial dyes and appear duller as a result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PIM Brands team tracked these concerns a decade ago, and began a plan to transition its product. Its challenges ranged from feasibility (how do you source a color as rare as blue?) to its own scale\u2014the company\u2019s own color suppliers couldn\u2019t meet their demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of today, a simple Welch\u2019s Fruit Snack is a portrait of our complex global industrial supply chain. The majority of its ingredients are a real fruit puree that match the flavor they&#8217;re advertising. That means for a strawberry snack, the company uses strawberries rather than defaulting to cheaper ingredients like apples and pears and supplementing flavor with extracts. But these fruits generally don\u2019t supply the amount of color to which artificial dyes have accustomed us: peach, for instance, would be but the faintest shade of orange without dye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PIM&#8217;s approach means that it already sources 30 different fruits from countries around the globe, tracking seasonal produce worldwide so that it can constantly produce all of its flavors of fruit snack. \u201cWhen it\u2019s hot in one place, it\u2019s cold in another,\u201d says Rosenberg. \u201cSo we&#8217;re really traversing the globe for our raw materials.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shifting to natural dyes meant shifting from a synthetic supply chain, derived from abundant petroleum, to a complex global footprint with similar problems to PIM&#8217;s primary fruit sourcing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine that you need a certain fruit to source a certain color. If it\u2019s grown in China instead of India, it will be different due to the climate and terroir. Each fruit\u2019s hue could shift alongside ensuing chemical differences. That means fruits sourced from two different parts of the globe for color need to be constantly rebalanced and mixed appropriately to control each shade. Furthermore, those natural ingredients come with added concerns around contamination and food safety that don\u2019t accompany their sterile synthetic counterparts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Two open packages of fruit snacks on a white table arranged side-by-side. The shapes of the individual pieces are unchanged, but the group of naturally dyed snacks on the right has are ever so slightly less saturated and vivid when compared directly to the artificially dyed group on the left. \" class=\"wp-image-91367435\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/i-2-91367059-welchs-natural-colors.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Welch&#8217;s Fruit Snacks]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-any-color-but-brown\">Any color but brown</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Making matters tricker is that processed foods add dyes in part because they oxidize, turning food brown over time. That\u2019s specifically a concern for Welch\u2019s Fruit Snacks, which are mostly oxidation-prone fruit that\u2019s been stabilized in gelatine (which is less color-dependable than drier processed foods due to its water content). The team clarifies that not all products are as tricky to update with natural dyes as their own product\u2014Ramani notes that hard candies, for instance, should be much easier, as desiccant sugars and corn syrup keeps colors more stable. The other unique challenge facing PIM is that this fruit creates acidity, and acids, too, will break down natural colors.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each different color\u2014like the yellows in its orange snacks, and the reds in its strawberry\u2014had to be developed on its own. The company also created a new, proprietary process to add its natural dyes to its puree on the assembly line at a precise moment, using just the right method\u2014and it updated its own packaging to tweak the exchange of oxygen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even still, to validate each color, they didn\u2019t want to simply simulate the effects of heat or humidity. So they created the snacks and let them sit on the shelf, analyzing them each month for 18 months to see if the color shifted. The tests involved dozens of different natural dyes to find those that worked best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere were times where we&#8217;re at, you know, six months, seven months, and we didn\u2019t like the way the color had held up,\u201d says Ramani. \u201cAnd so then we got to start over again, right back at one month.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yellow was the first color PIM solved\u2014in 2015, concerns of yellow dyes spiked with <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25750299/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">research linking them to cancer triggers</a>\u2014and in what the team deemed to be relatively easy fix, it replaced its synthetic yellow with turmeric and annatto (both popular natural yellow dyes Kraft used to update their macaroni and cheese around the same time).\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its other colors are only coming to market now and over the next several months. The new red is made from purple carrot, red grape, and anthocyanins. Of all of the colors, its most difficult update was blue. Despite it filling our oceans and sky, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/1588812/long-strange-history-prussian-blue\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blue is actually one of the world\u2019s rarest colors</a>. The company found its solution in South America\u2019s huito fruit, which looks something like jackfruit crossed with a lime, but develops blue tones when exposed to air. Alongside a little spirulina, it created just the right color.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-trying-the-new-version\">Trying the new version</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After hearing so much about PIM&#8217;s commitment to a perfect color switch, as I open two packs of Welch\u2019s Fruit Snacks side-by-side\u2014one with artificial dyes and one with natural\u2014I am surprised that I can definitely see a difference, as can my kids (who do both partake in the snacks now and again). The naturally dyed snacks are undeniably less saturated, with slightly less rich reds and oranges.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cScientifically there will never be complete parity between artificial and natural colors,\u201d Ramani concedes. \u201cWe conducted side-by-side visual and sensory panels internally and externally . . . most consumers either couldn\u2019t tell the difference, or preferred the new colors knowing they came from natural sources.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I weren\u2019t looking at them side-by-side, I\u2019d never know myself. But I do swear the new snacks taste a little less sweet. It\u2019s something my son notes, too, unprompted and unaware of research pointing out just this phenomenon. If we were blindfolded or in a dark movie theater, would we have noticed? We\u2019d need to set up a larger blind taste test to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there is no shortage of sweet treats on the market if your only concern is a sugar blast. And as a consumer who has loathed unnecessary artificial dyes for years\u2014perhaps the one health topic on which RFK Jr and scientifically minded liberals agree\u2014I\u2019m only more likely to buy Welch\u2019s Fruit Snacks now. And watching my kids eagerly nosh on my remaining press samples, it doesn\u2019t seem they\u2019re sweating the changes, either.</p>",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91362412/how-kroger-designed-its-catchy-new-sonic-logo",
    "description": "<p>What does Kroger\u2019s brand <em>sound</em> like? Until recently, no one knew. And then on June 25, the grocery behemoth (which includes regional chains like King Soopers, Fred Meyer, Ralphs, and Pick&#8217;n Save) launched its first-ever sonic identity. There\u2019s a succinct sonic logo (think Netflix\u2019s <em>tudum</em>), a full brand theme song, and more\u2014so as it turns out, <em>this</em> is officially what Kroger sounds like:</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"overflow: hidden; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s an upbeat earworm you\u2019re going to be hearing a lot of in grocery stores, on TV, and everywhere the Kroger family of brands reaches. But it\u2019s no mere jingle, and there\u2019s a surprising amount of strategy and craft behind such an audio signature\u2014and real financial impact as well, notes John Taite, EVP of global brand partnerships and development at <a href=\"https://www.mademusicstudio.com/\">Made Music Studio</a>, which created the work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPeople think about what they see, but they <em>feel</em> what they hear,\u201d he says. And it&#8217;s apropos, because, well, \u201cthere&#8217;s always an emotional element to any sort of purchase decision.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-sound-of-krojis\"><strong>THE SOUND OF &#8216;KROJIS</strong>&#8216;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The work comes at the tail of a five-year brand revamp at Kroger, the largest U.S. supermarket chain by revenue. Its family of brands across the U.S. had essentially operated as independent entities from a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketing</a> perspective, but around 2019\u20132020, the company decided to begin uniting them in a more intentional way. Tom Duncan, Kroger\u2019s VP, head of marketing, says the initiative began with the launch of the brand\u2019s animated \u201cKroji\u201d characters (a portmanteau of <em>Kroger</em> and <em>emoji</em>), and continued with the debut of the \u201cfresh cart\u201d <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/krogers-rebrand-continues-unifying-symbol-fresh-cart/\">logo</a> in 2021, which like the Krojis was rolled out to all Kroger markets and sub-brands. Now, the sonic identity is the latest tool in Kroger\u2019s bid to unify everything under one marketing roof.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe believe that this makes our advertising work harder to drive more traffic and sales,\u201d Duncan says. \u201cIn a holistic system standpoint, creating consistent, distinctive assets and engaging more of the customers\u2019 senses are a way to make it work harder for us\u2014and be more memorable over time.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-finding-the-inevitable-nbsp\"><strong>FINDING THE INEVITABLE&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taite says that in Made Music\u2019s competitive analysis, they found that grocery as a category was lacking or inconsistent when it came to sonic logos. No one was embracing sonic design in a truly comprehensive way, so in a cluttered marketplace, that presented an opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development process of the new work took around a year, and Taite says his team began with a deep immersion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI don&#8217;t want to say we become musical detectives, but we almost become like method actors. We have to live and breathe and really experience the brand, and that&#8217;s why spending a lot of time with the team members, looking at the places where the work will live in the world, and understanding the brand&#8217;s place in culture as well is a really important starting point.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duncan adds that everyone from store managers to Kroger\u2019s comms and marketing teams were involved, and the process was deeply collaborative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"overflow: hidden; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As Made Music worked to absorb the brand, they began to build a foundation to work toward\u2014to \u201cfind the almost inevitable sound of a brand,\u201d as Taite puts it. They seized on notions of <em>fresh</em>, <em>friendly</em>, <em>relatable</em>, and <em>playful</em>, and envisioned Kroger a bit like a wedding\u2014a space that\u2019s a multigenerational gathering point, with music elevating the experience. And from there, they began to give dimensionality those notions with sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to what you might expect, Made Music does not start by making the core sonic logo of a few seconds, but rather the larger brand theme. Even though consumers might not ever hear it, Taite says it offers the blueprint for all of the subsequent campaign materials, including the logo, which is a distillation of the longer piece.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it came to translating Kroger\u2019s brand values into audio, \u201cwe know exactly what types of sounds can stimulate particular emotional responses,\u201d Taite says, citing the company\u2019s decades of experience. Here, that translated to an uplifting track with welcoming rhythms and jazz vibes, where the sound of all the instruments working together mirrors the notion of inviting everyone in. (There\u2019s a bit of an Easter egg, too: Kroger is synonymous with the color blue, and the sonic identity features a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_note\">blue note</a>, which in music is essentially a note at an alternate pitch.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-art-science\"><strong>ART + SCIENCE</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to disciplines like brand naming, all of this might seem a bit subjective and nebulous. How do you know if you\u2019re actually on the right track?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taite says Made Music has worked with the market research firm Sentient Decision Science for a number of years\u2014and this project rated the highest of any sonic identity his company has ever developed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Per Duncan on the Kroger side, \u201cThere&#8217;s an element of art and science here\u2014and obviously, the science part gives us confidence.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After being presented with options from Made Music, the Kroger team seized on the winning concept right away. Given that Kroger had involved so many stakeholders throughout, Taite says, there was a sense of pride and enthusiasm around the work, which he adds has yielded one of the fastest rollouts in the organization\u2019s history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat little earworm melody that we created, the more you hear it, the more you think it&#8217;s always been there,\u201d Taite says. \u201cThat&#8217;s the lightning-in-the-bottle moment that we&#8217;re always, always searching for.\u201d</p>",

    "description": "<p>In May of 1995, the video game industry hosted its first major trade show. Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) was designed to shine a spotlight on games, and every major player wanted to stand in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sega believed it had figured out how to command that spotlight. Riding high on the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3034581/25-years-after-the-console-wars-what-we-can-learn-from-segas-battle-w/\">success of the Sega Genesis</a>, the company unveiled the Sega Saturn at its press conference. After a quirky segment that resembled <a href=\"https://youtu.be/cyv6ZehQyTQ?t=328\">one of Sega&#8217;s off-the-wall commercials</a>, Tom Kalinske, CEO of Sega of America, delivered a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0UrXV53QKmk?t=2048\">bombshell announcement</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since I began my remarks with an announcement, I might as well finish with another: We started our rollout of the Sega Saturn yesterday,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re at retail today in 1,800 Toys &#8220;R&#8221; Us, Software Etc., and Electronics Boutique stores around the U.S. and Canada.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sega hoped it would be a mic drop moment. Instead, it marked the beginning of the end for the company\u2019s hardware business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What the press conference audience didn\u2019t know was that Kalinske had strongly opposed the early launch. He had argued fiercely with Sega\u2019s Japanese leadership, pointing to his past success with the Genesis in the U.S. and warning that a surprise launch without a proper <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketing</a> ramp-up wouldn&#8217;t work. But his objections were overruled.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story is part of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/1995-week\">1995 Week</a>, where we\u2019ll revisit some of the most interesting, unexpected, and confounding developments in tech 30 years ago.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;[I] didn\u2019t understand why this was occurring,&#8221; he <a href=\"https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-former-sega-president-tom-kalinske-on-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-16-bit-empire\">told <em>TimeExtension</em></a> in 2022. &#8220;I was forced to introduce it. We didn\u2019t have enough hardware. We didn\u2019t have enough software. And then, to make matters worse, we were forced to introduce it five months earlier than we wanted.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sega\u2019s announcement turned heads\u2014but they quickly turned again when Sony <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3050768/happy-20th-birthday-sony-playstation\">held its own press conference</a> later that day. After showcasing the PlayStation and a long list of development partners, Olaf Olafsson, head of Sony America, invited Steve Race (formerly Sega\u2019s own marketing chief) to the stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Race approached the podium, put down his notes, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaAYIKsDBI\">simply said</a>: &#8220;299,&#8221; then walked away. That one number undercut the Saturn and every other console on the market by $100.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time Sega abandoned the Saturn just three years later, it had sold fewer than 2 million units in the U.S. The company would release one final system\u2014the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-i-still-play-dreamcast/\">Dreamcast</a>\u2014in 1998 in Japan and 1999 in the U.S. But the Saturn\u2019s mishandled launch had already altered Sega\u2019s trajectory forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-doomed-launch\">A Doomed Launch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Saturn was dead before it came out because of the poor decision-making Sega had made,&#8221; says Chris Kohler, a video game historian and editorial director at Digital Eclipse Entertainment Partners. \u201cWhen it came out in Japan, Sega was also launching 32X, an add-on for the Sega Genesis. . . . All it ended up doing was completely confusing consumers. They had no idea what to buy.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite that confusion, the Saturn had a decent launch in Japan. Its game lineup appealed to local tastes, especially with a home version of <em>Virtua Fighter</em>, a massive arcade hit. But American gamers were harder to win over. While titles like <em>Panzer Dragoon</em> and <em>Clockwork Knight</em> have dedicated fanbases today, they <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3005243/will-wii-u-join-gaming-graveyard\">weren\u2019t enough</a> to justify a $399 console (about $842 in today\u2019s dollars).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI tried and tried to get the launch pushed back so that we had some actual software to support it,\u201d Kalinske <a href=\"https://www.timeextension.com/features/flashback-reliving-the-drama-of-e3-1995-when-sega-took-on-sony-and-lost\">told <em>TimeExtension</em></a>. \u201cI was not successful. I had four glorious years where Sega Japan pretty much let me do whatever I felt was right, and then that stopped.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the Saturn\u2019s most glaring missteps was the lack of a <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> game\u2014not just at launch, but throughout its entire lifespan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, Sonic was at the height of his popularity. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> had sold 4 million copies the year prior. He also starred in a Saturday morning cartoon and the CGI-animated series <em>Sonic Boom</em> on Cartoon Network. Launching a Sega console without Sonic was like launching a Nintendo console without Mario.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The surprise launch strategy also backfired on Sega in another way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Essentially, they kneecapped themselves,&#8221; says Kohler. &#8220;They can only ship it to certain retailers, so the retailers that don&#8217;t get those early shipments get burned and they don&#8217;t want to stock Sega products anymore. . . . Consumers didn&#8217;t have the ability to get excited or put down preorders. It hit the market without any buildup.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-unexpected-fight\">An Unexpected Fight</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sega knew Sony would bring the PlayStation to the U.S., but didn\u2019t initially view it as a serious threat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the mid-1990s, lots of big, non-gaming focused companies had tried to step into the videogame world. Magnavox had released several versions of the Odyssey in the 1970s. Philips had released the CD-i a few years prior to the Saturn&#8217;s introduction. The Neo Geo was already on the market and the TurboGrafx-16 had just been discontinued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Sony was different. Aggressive and well-prepared, its $299 price point stunned the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We didn\u2019t know they were going to do it, and when they did, we were like: &#8216;We are screwed here,'&#8221; said Kalinske. &#8220;We weren\u2019t making money at $399, so we had a problem.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers responded immediately. Retailers increased orders, and developers rushed to work with the PlayStation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All of these big hardware makers were coming into the video game industry and falling on their face,&#8221; says Kohler. &#8220;Sony, of all of them, comes in and is not only successful but outrageously successful.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-executive-departures\">Executive Departures</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kalinske\u2019s frustrations continued after the Saturn launch, and in July of the following year, he resigned\u2014though he remained on the board. Bernard Stolar, who had been instrumental in launching the PlayStation, took over at Sega.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first move was to abandon the Saturn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I got to Sega I immediately said, \u2018We have to kill Saturn. We have to stop Saturn and start building the new technology.\u2019 That\u2019s what I did. I brought in a new team of people and cleaned house. . . . I took the company down to 90 employees to start rebuilding,\u201d Stolar, who died in 2022, <a href=\"https://gamesbeat.com/gaming-legend-bernie-stolar-passes-away/\">once told <em>GamesBeat</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That team created the Dreamcast, which performed well in the U.S. but not well enough to restore Sega\u2019s dominance\u2014especially as Microsoft prepared to enter the market. Lacking the resources to compete with Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, Sega exited the hardware business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Sega is part of Sammy Corp. and focuses solely on software, with franchises ranging from <em>Angry Birds</em> to <em>Total War</em>\u2014and of course, <em>Sonic</em>, who now stars in a successful film series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s hard not to ask, \u201cWhat if?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if Sega had waited until September to launch the Saturn, as originally planned? What if it had a stronger launch lineup for the U.S. market?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no answers, only the reality that the Saturn\u2019s missteps reshaped the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In a lot of ways, it was Sega&#8217;s to lose and they just fumbled it,&#8221; says Kohler.</p>",

Sign up to receive <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/the-big-story?source=www.propublica.org&amp;placement=top-note&amp;region=texas\">our biggest stories</a> as soon as they\u2019re published.</p>\n<p>This article is co-published with <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/texasnewsroom\">The Texas Newsroom</a> and <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/newsletters/briefweekly/\">The Texas Tribune</a> as part of an initiative to report on how power is wielded in Texas.</p>\n\n        \n\n    \n      \n  \n\n\n\n                    \n<p>Texas Gov. <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/tags/greg-abbott\">Greg Abbott</a> doesn\u2019t want <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25975648-2025-06-03-abbott-musk-comms-appeal/\">to reveal months of communications</a> with <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/tags/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a> or representatives from the tech mogul\u2019s companies, arguing in part that they are of a private nature, not of public interest and potentially embarrassing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/elon-musk-texas-legislature-laws-spacex-tesla\">Musk had an eventful legislative session in Texas</a> this year. In addition to his lobbyists successfully advocating for several new laws, Abbott cited the <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/tags/tesla\">Tesla</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/tags/spacex\">SpaceX</a> CEO as the inspiration for the state creating its own efficiency office and has praised him for moving the headquarters for many of his businesses to the state in recent years. </p>\n\n<p>As part of an effort to <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-07-02/texas-elon-musk-spacex\">track the billionaire\u2019s influence</a> in the state Capitol, The Texas Newsroom in April requested Abbott and his staff\u2019s emails since last fall with Musk and other people who have an email address associated with some of his companies. </p>\n\n<p>Initially, the governor\u2019s office said it would take more than 13 hours to review the records. It provided a cost estimate of $244.64 for the work and required full payment up front. The Texas Newsroom agreed and cut a check. </p>\n\n<p>After the check was cashed, the governor\u2019s office told The Texas Newsroom it believed all of the records were confidential and asked Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose office referees disputes over public records, to allow the documents to be kept private.</p>\n\n<p>Matthew Taylor, Abbott\u2019s public information coordinator, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25975648-2025-06-03-abbott-musk-comms-appeal/\">gave several reasons</a> the records should not be released. He argued they include private exchanges with lawyers, details about policy-making decisions and information that would reveal how the state entices companies to invest here. Releasing them to the public, he wrote, \u201cwould have a chilling effect on the frank and open discussion necessary for the decision-making process.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Taylor also argued that the communications are confidential under an exception to public records laws known as \u201ccommon-law privacy\u201d because they consist of \u201cinformation that is intimate and embarrassing and not of legitimate concern to the public, including financial decisions that do not relate to transactions between an individual and a governmental body.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>He did not provide further details about the exact content of the records.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The language Abbott\u2019s office used appears to be fairly boilerplate. Paxton\u2019s office, in an explanation of the <a href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/open-government/governmental-bodies/open-records-memorandum-rulings\">common-law privacy exception</a> on its website, mentions that \u201cpersonal financial information\u201d that doesn\u2019t deal with government transactions \u201cis generally highly intimate or embarrassing and must be withheld.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But Bill Aleshire, a Texas-based attorney specializing in public records law, was appalled that the governor is claiming that months of emails between his office and one of the world\u2019s richest people are all private.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRight now, it appears they\u2019ve charged you $244 for records they have no intention of giving you,\u201d Aleshire said. \u201cThat is shocking.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Aleshire said it\u2019s not unusual for government agencies to tap the common-law privacy exception in an attempt to withhold records from the public. But he\u2019s used to it being cited in cases that involve children, medical data or other highly personal information \u2014 not for emails between an elected official and a businessman. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re boxing in the dark,\u201d Aleshire said. \u201cYou can\u2019t even see what the target is or what\u2019s behind their claim.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Aleshire added that due to a recent <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/06/27/texas-supreme-court-paxton-abbott-uvalde-jan-6-emails/\">Texas Supreme Court ruling</a>, there is effectively no way to enforce public records laws against Abbott and other top state officials. He called the decision an \u201cace card\u201d for these politicians. </p>\n\n<p>The case dealt with requests to release Abbott and Paxton\u2019s communications in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and the 2022 <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/uvalde-officer-student-trainings-mass-shootings\">school shooting in Uvalde</a>. The high court ruled that it is the only body that can review whether these officials are in compliance with public records laws.</p>\n\n<p>Kevin Bagnall, a lawyer representing Musk\u2019s rocket company <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25984819-spacex-objections-to-oog-pir-202-25-redacted/\">SpaceX, also wrote a letter</a> to Paxton\u2019s office arguing the emails should be kept secret. He cited one main reason: They contain \u201ccommercial information whose disclosure would cause SpaceX substantial competitive harm.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>Most of the rest of Bagnall\u2019s letter, which further explained SpaceX\u2019s argument, was redacted.</p>\n\n<p>Musk and representatives for his companies did not respond to requests for comment for this story.</p>\n\n<p>Abbott\u2019s spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the records, including whether The Texas Newsroom would be refunded if Paxton withholds them. </p>\n\n<p>In a statement, he said, \u201cThe Office of the Governor rigorously complies with the Texas Public Information Act and will release any responsive information that is determined to not be confidential or excepted from disclosure.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The office of the attorney general has 45 business days to determine whether to release Abbott\u2019s records.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Lauren McGaughy is a journalist with <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/texasnewsroom\">The Texas Newsroom</a>, a collaboration among NPR and the public radio stations in Texas.

    "description": "<p>The Nakagin Capsule Tower in Tokyo was one of the most distinctive buildings of the 20th century, both for its oddball form and for its tumultuous evolution. A space station stack of 140 prefabricated cabin-like capsule living spaces completed in 1972, the building went from high concept design to <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketing</a> triumph to architectural wonder to <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90737420/the-nakagin-capsule-tower-one-of-the-worlds-weirdest-and-most-wonderful-buildings-will-be-demolished\">lamented demolition</a>. Now, the building is taking on a new form inside the galleries of New York&#8217;s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) for <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5830\"><em>The Many Lives of the Nakagin Capsule Tower</em></a>, a year-long exhibition that opened July 10. The central piece of the exhibition is the roughly 100-square-foot <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/434291?artist_id=6967&amp;page=1&amp;sov_referrer=artist\">capsule A1305</a>, a complete and fully restored living chamber from the building that visitors will be able to step inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91363282\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/Minami_02_JPEG.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Noritaka Minami]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Especially for architecture exhibitions, sometimes we&#8217;re able to show actual pieces of buildings, or fragments,&#8221; says curator Evangelos Kotsioris. &#8220;But what is extremely rare here is that it&#8217;s a whole unit by itself.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s because the building had a wholly innovative design: two tower cores surrounded with individual rectangular living units, or capsules, that attached to the structure like appendages. Designed for the Nakagin Company by architect Kisho Kurokawa, the building came to epitomize the avant-garde Metabolist movement that developed in 1960s Japan as an effort to use adaptable architecture as an avenue for rebuilding postwar Japan and Japanese society. In the mind of Kurokawa, who died in 2007, the capsule tower was meant to evolve, with old capsules being swapped out for new ones as needs and times changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This never happened, not exactly anyway. The building slowly decayed over the years and deferred maintenance doomed much of it to becoming uninhabitable before it was demolished in 2022. Some capsules and building parts were salvaged, though, and more than a dozen capsules have been fully restored. Capsule A1305 was acquired by MoMA in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91363285\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/Nakagin_03_JPEG.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Kisho Kurokawa, Architect &amp; Associates, 1972 [Photo: Tomio Ohashi]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Nakagin Capsule Tower exhibition is more than just a showcase of an architectural curio. It features 45 other objects relating to the building and its design, including the only surviving physical model from the early 1970s, the original architectural drawings of the building, historic marketing material from the Nakagin Company for the building&#8217;s original use as a businessman&#8217;s pied-\u00e0-terre, and a digital building walk-through created with 3D scanning technology just days before the building&#8217;s demolition. Kotsioris also interviewed the group of residents who lived in the capsule tower during its final decade, and the exhibition includes documentation on the varied ways they repurposed the capsules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The capsule itself, if you just look at it from the outside, it&#8217;s not telling you much. You cannot fully comprehend the radicality of the proposition behind it,&#8221; Kotsioris says. &#8220;I thought it was really important for its first presentation in New York to contextualize it properly, with the ideas about the birth of the project, the drawing, the models, but also interviews with residents.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The capsule in the exhibition is a faithful recreation of the way the building was originally marketed, as a part-time residence for businessmen visiting Tokyo for work. One famous ad for the building shows a smiling businessman inside a capsule, seemingly after work, lounging on the bed while talking on the phone and smoking a Marlboro, with the capsule&#8217;s built-in Sony TV and audio electronics playing in the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91363286\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/73_2023_vw003_CCCR-Full-size-JPEG_JPEG.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Kisho Kurokawa, Architect &amp; Associates, 1970-1972; restored 2022-2023 [Photo: MOMA]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kurokawa intended the building to be more than just a space for businessmen, envisioning the building with multiple capsule sizes for offices, hotel rooms, and family residences. That vision narrowed, but also evolved, as Kurokawa later went on to design the first capsule hotel in Osaka in 1979.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even short of Kurokawa&#8217;s original intent, the Nakagin Capsule Tower has influenced generations of architects, while also pushing new ideas about urban living in Japan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/nov/16/japan-reusable-housing-revolution\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">impermanence in the built environment</a>, and <a href=\"https://archive.curbed.com/2017/10/25/16534122/prefab-homes-manufacturing-japan-vs-us\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prefabricated housing</a>. &#8220;Even though there was a lot of speculative projects about capsule living and prefabricated dwellings, even from the early 20th century,&#8221; Kotsioris says, &#8220;this was really the first realized prototype on the ground that said this is an idea that you can actually put into action.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91363291\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/IMG_20250123_0003-1-2-1667x2000-1.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Nakagin Co. promo, 1971 [Photo: Courtesy Tatsuyuki Maeda / The Nakagin Capsule Tower Preservation and Restoration Project]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>MoMA members will be able to step inside the capsule during several special events throughout the exhibition&#8217;s run, which Kotsioris says should be a treat. &#8220;I remember the first time I entered a capsule,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There&#8217;s something extremely magical about being inside it, because it&#8217;s very small, but at the same time it feels spacious.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nakagin Capsule Tower exhibition explores the ways the building played multiple roles in its five-decade lifespan. Despite the compact size of the capsules, they evolved over time from a kind of temporary living quarters to more of a permanent residence. And, Kotsioris found, the individualist nature of the capsules changed over time, too, as maintenance and structural issues began to plague the building. &#8220;The more the building started to break down over the years, the more it generated social interactions,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Residents told him that frequent earthquake evacuation alarms in the aging structure turned into social gatherings in the lobby. When the hot water boiler stopped working, a group of residents would travel together to a nearby bathhouse to take showers, and when the air conditioning broke, they&#8217;d gather in one of the units with a working dehumidifier for drinks after work. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91363290\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/Nakagin_01_JPEG.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Jeremie Souteyrat]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These unintended uses of the building\u2014a version of the Metabolist architecture idea Kurokawa was designing around\u2014helped it remain useful up until the end. &#8220;Kurokawa had one idea of how this project could be metabolized or change over time,&#8221; Kotsioris says. &#8220;And it did metabolize, but maybe in a different way than he would ever have imagined.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<hr />",

Due to climate change, virus-carrying species like those that transmit Zika and dengue are creeping into nontropical latitudes. The United States, Europe, and other areas outside of the tropics are <a href=\"https://www.rti.org/insights/rise-mosquito-borne-diseases-us#:~:text=Up%20until%20%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B,for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">facing a growing threat</a>. Take Europe: In 2024, the hottest year on record, the European Union documented <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/health/20250515-europe-on-brink-of-endemic-dengue-and-chikungunya-as-mosquitoes-move-north\">more than 300 autochthonous dengue cases</a>\u2014acquired within European territory\u2014surpassing the 275 cases recorded during the previous 15 years <em>combined.</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tiger mosquito, which transmits dengue and Zika, has already established itself in 13 EU countries. And optimal temperatures for these bugs to thrive\u2014between 75 and 79 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014are becoming increasingly common during European summers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pew-pew-pew-you-re-dead\">Pew, pew, pew\u2014you\u2019re dead</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of using laser beams to destroy mosquitoes dates back to 2007, during a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation brainstorming session on eliminating malaria. That\u2019s when astrophysicist Lowell Wood\u2014one of the architects of Reagan&#8217;s &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; Strategic Defense Initiative\u2014<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150310085013/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123680870885500701\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">proposed a laser system</a> not to stop the Soviet Union from nuking the U.S., but to defend humans against mosquitoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many tried to fulfill Wood&#8217;s idea, but Wong&#8217;s project might be the first to achieve an affordable commercial solution (though at this first stage, each Photon Matrix costs nearly $500). The key that makes the device work lies in current hardware capabilities and computer vision\u2019s ability to quickly recognize objects. The system, Wong explains, identifies targets through movement pattern analysis, distinguishing between mosquitoes and similar pixel signals like dust or sensor noise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how it works: The insect dome uses a light-detection-and-ranging (LiDAR) module that fires thousands of laser pulses that bounce off any solid object, creating a real-time 3D map of its surroundings. When they hit something airborne, the photons bounce back, and the system detects how long it takes for the light to return. When it spots a mosquito, the system calculates its distance, orientation, and body size in just three milliseconds, Wong claims, marking the target for destruction. At that moment, a second laser fires, this one capable of instantly hitting the mosquito with a pulse that&#8217;s lethal to the bug but harmless to humans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, the technology only works with insects flying slower than 1 meter per second\u2014a speed that includes mosquitoes (which fly between 0.6 and 0.9 mph) and some small flies like sand flies and fruit flies, but excludes much faster houseflies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Photon Matrix also employs millimeter-wave radar to constantly scan its field of view for larger objects. If it detects people or pets, the laser won&#8217;t fire. When an object significantly larger than a mosquito enters the detection range, the system can quickly and precisely identify it and refrain from laser activation, Wong says. He claims that this prototype not only effectively eliminates mosquitoes using laser technology, but also prioritizes safety as its core feature. The design incorporates &#8220;mandatory safety certification requirements&#8221;\u2014though it doesn&#8217;t specify which standards it meets or whether they&#8217;re Chinese or international.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic version offers a 90-degree surveillance and elimination range, with a 10-foot reach. The professional version extends that range to 20 feet. Both models can operate in completely dark rooms and can withstand water immersion up to 5 feet for 30 minutes, thanks to their IP68 (dust-tight and waterproof) certification. The system draws power from wall outlets using a USB adapter or from portable batteries that provide between eight and 16 hours of autonomy, depending on the model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The laser system isn&#8217;t perfect. The Photon Matrix&#8217;s limited range means it can&#8217;t protect extensive areas like large patios or public spaces. Its effectiveness also decreases with rain, which can interfere with optical sensors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-world-war-against-mosquitoes\">World war against mosquitoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Photon Matrix is just the latest invention that is trying to defend humans against mosquitoes. Other people have been trying to find solutions for ages, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/07/male-mosquito-semen-poison-females-australian-research\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">most of them</a> using <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/genetically-modified-mosquitoes-and-malaria-africa-top-scientist-shares-latest\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">genetic modifications</a> to stop their reproduction. Some scientists also went low-cost, like with &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/how-to-build-mosquito-trap-from-old-tire-180958954/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ovillantas</a>,&#8221; a term combining the words &#8220;ovi&#8221; (a prefix in biology for &#8220;egg&#8221;) with &#8220;llantas&#8221; (Spanish for &#8220;tires&#8221;). Developed by Canadian chemistry professor G\u00e9rard Ul\u00edbarri of Laurentian University in Ontario, this device exploits mosquitoes&#8217; strange attraction to old tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ul\u00edbarri discovered that these insects are attracted to some chemical compound in rubber that drives them to lay eggs inside the hollow interior of tires. In fact, scientists have determined that this type of &#8220;nest&#8221; can produce up to one-third of all mosquitoes in an area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The traps are built inside a section of a tire that&#8217;s fitted with a drainage valve at the bottom. Next, it&#8217;s filled with water and pieces of paper that float like \u201clanding strips\u201d for mosquitoes\u2014on which they lay their eggs in the stagnant water. The water is drained once or twice a week and filtered through a cloth to remove the larvae. That filtered water preserves the pheromones carried by the eggs and is reused, indicating to other mosquitoes that this is a good place to lay more eggs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Results from the pilot project in the Guatemalan town of Sayaxch\u00e9 were promising: Ovillantas destroyed seven times more mosquitoes than traditional traps, eliminating nearly 18,000 larvae per month. In fact, the project claims no new dengue cases were recorded in the area\u2014where normally there would be two or three dozen cases a month. Ul\u00edbarri estimates that two ovillantas per acre are sufficient to impact a local mosquito population, although &#8220;the more you have, the better,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps in the future, scientists and engineers will come up with a 100% effective solution. But for now, the ideal approach is combining multiple systems\u2014home laser beams, reproductive traps, epidemiological surveillance, repellents, and physical barriers like netting\u2014which can provide a layered defense against a present and growing threat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-multilayered-defense\">Multilayered defense</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither ovillantas nor this domestic &#8220;Iron Dome&#8221; can completely eliminate the threat of mosquitoes, although plenty of people seem swayed by the latter. The crowdfunding campaign seeks $20,000\u2014which it has far exceeded, at more than $758,000 right now\u2014with a presale pricing of $497 for the basic version and $598 for the professional model. (The usual Indiegogo/Kickstarter \u201cmight never reach market\u201d caveat applies.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wong acknowledges that price is the system\u2019s biggest problem. The production and selling costs of this product are relatively high, he says, and the only way to solve it is by manufacturing scale. He says that third parties have already approached him to build the Photon Matrix in large numbers. The big question is, of course: Will it really work? If the videos are true, then one day we could see them at much lower prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s hope it all goes well. Not only because these viruses could soon become endemic\u2014but also because I want to sit in my garden on a hot summer night and watch hundreds of these insects go down in flames after saying, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYNnoPyEMAI\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cYou may fire when ready,\u201d</a> in my best<em> </em>Peter Cushing voice (from <em>Star Wars: A New Hope</em>).</p>",

    "description": "<p>Some days, \u201cHave a great day!!!\u201d is just too much to ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might even be tempted to respond to this effusive well-wisher: \u201cHave you seen the news?\u201d \u201cHave you seen my to-do list?\u201d \u201cHave you seen my team\u2019s numbers?\u201d \u201cHave you seen my sleep score?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some days, you might just settle for \u201cHaving a day.\u201d And yet, that doesn\u2019t feel great either. It would be nice to do more than <em>get through the week, </em>to do more than <em><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91352865/how-to-add-more-fun-in-to-your-work-day-while-still-getting-work-done\">endure</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have guided many leaders whose company cultures were built on endurance. I have endured many days myself. I know how easy it is to paint a day or week as categorically \u201chard\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d But calling a whole day \u201cbad\u201d is like calling a gravel driveway \u201cflat.\u201d Sure, from a distance it\u2019s flat-ish, but from an ant\u2019s point of view, it might as well be a mountain range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we sometimes miss is that even on aggressively bad days, there is often an hour or two that is kind of okay. Or maybe every single last hour is hard, but within an hour, there is a minute when you laugh at a colleague\u2019s joke or check out your good hair day in the mirror. Even if you\u2019re in a meeting when every last minute is painful reviewing your business\u2019s financials, you still have access to a delicious five seconds of deeply breathing in the smell of your coffee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or in other words: You can thin-slice your joy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the last thing harried, overworked people need is to add \u201clearn meditation\u201d to their to-do list. Similarly, deciding to focus on fewer things sounds nice, but your boss may respectfully disagree. It would also be good to distance yourself from people who stress you out and demand your attention unfairly, but you know what? Sometimes those people are your kids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these moments, you can thin-slice your joy in two ways: savoring the joy already present in your day, and creating new moments of micro-joy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-savoring-your-daily-joys\">Savoring your daily joys</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like scarfing down a meal while watching TV or getting some work done, it\u2019s easy to anesthetize ourselves to pleasure without realizing it. The good news is that it takes the same amount of time to chew mindlessly as it does to savor the taste of your food\u2014it simply requires attention. Here are three no-time-required actions you can take to bank more joy from your day:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Appreciate a quirk. </strong>In your next meeting, look around the room (2D or 3D) and identify one quirky thing you like about a colleague. Maybe someone throws their head back when they laugh and it\u2019s joyful. Or another person drums their fingers when they\u2019re about to share a good idea. It\u2019s an appreciation of their humanity and individuality, which makes us feel closer to them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Smell first. </strong>Before sipping your coffee, tea, or other beverage, take three seconds to smell it first. Risk looking indulgent: close your eyes and breathe in for three seconds\u2014then sip. If it\u2019s a particularly rough day, sprinkle some cinnamon on that cappuccino. This practice is especially useful when you feel \u201cin your head.\u201d Reconnecting with our senses brings us back to the present moment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Revel in your work. </strong>The next time you write a particularly funny Slack message, a compelling email, or create some bit of work that\u2019s better than your average, take one minute to simply stare at it and enjoy how clever you are. We\u2019re so often on to the next thing\u2014and when we do review our work, we often do so with a critical eye\u2014that we miss the part where we feel pleased with ourselves! Even enjoying a cute turn of phrase in an email is plenty to savor.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-creating-new-micro-joys\">Creating new micro-joys</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be lovely if we all had the time, energy, and budget to take up new hobbies, make new friends, and take two-hour lunch breaks. And if you can, you should! But also, joy is not all-or-nothing. A good thought experiment to get you dreaming about micro-joys is to consider what sort of habits, experiences, or moments bring you the <em>most</em> joy\u2014and then identify their smallest viable unit. Here are three micro-joys to try this week:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Ask a random question. </strong>The next time you see a colleague you like, take two minutes to get to know them a bit better. You could say, \u201cRandom question: What\u2019s your middle name?\u201d or \u201cRandom question: Do you have siblings?\u201d<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/harvard-happiness-study-relationships/672753/\"> Longitudinal studies of human happiness</a> are very clear about what matters\u2014and that\u2019s the quality of our relationships. And yet, how often do we work with people and not know even the most basic facts about them? These questions shouldn\u2019t be a long diversion from your work\u2014even a minute of knowing someone better and that person feeling seen can be a high point of joy in your day.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Do a doodle a day. </strong>Spend two minutes on a simple doodle. Maybe you draw a different timepiece each day (watch! clocktower!). Maybe it\u2019s an abstract shape or a hand-lettered word. Maybe you draw a family of ducks, one day at a time. Bonus points if you do each doodle on a Post-it and then create a collection at your desk. We benefit from art, play, and self-expression during the workday, but maybe you\u2019d garner some side-eye if you set up an easel in the office. If you love art, then a daily doodle can be your version of a micro-joy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Misbehave. </strong>Mischief at work can give us a much-needed shot of adrenaline, connection, and adventure. This might look like rearranging the office furniture, using Comic Sans font in your next presentation, or playing a quick round of \u201cguess that tune\u201d with your colleagues as you hum your favorite throwback song. At best, work is steak: rich, juicy, delicious. But sometimes it\u2019s just not\u2014sometimes work is broccoli. On those days, your job is to throw some cheese on it. <em>Never gonna give you up . . . never gonna let you down</em> . . . take it, reader! Louder, so coworkers can hear!</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>And have yourself a great day! Or, you know, a day\u2014with at least one truly great moment.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Workers who take small steps to enforce work-life balance\u2014like setting an out-of-office message on weekends or not answering emails on vacation\u2014are often considered less committed and promotable, even when they\u2019re encouraged to take those actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597825000159?via%3Dihub\">behind a new study</a> looking at the phenomenon are calling this \u201cthe detachment paradox.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe were only looking at stuff that happens when the worker is not supposed to work, such as evenings, weekends, and vacations,\u201d says Elisa Solinas, an assistant professor of <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketing</a> at IE University in Spain and one of the paper\u2019s coauthors. \u201cWhat we still see is that the more the worker detaches, the more harshly they get evaluated.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-managers-both-value-and-punish-time-off\">Managers both value and punish time off</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers split managers into two groups and gave each the same fictitious story about a hypothetical employee, only for one group the protagonist took a small action to detach from work during their off hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managers perceived the employee who enforced some relatively minor work-life boundaries as more focused, less stressed out, and less likely to experience burnout. However, they also perceived that employee as less dedicated to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe same people who said that [the workers] are going to be more <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/productivity\" title=\"Productivity\">productive</a> also said that they were going to be less promotable,\u201d says coauthor Eva Buechel, an assistant professor of marketing at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. \u201cSo even the people who say this is really important and even encourage work-life balance penalize them [for detaching].\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers also came up with nearly identical results when they replaced the hypothetical workers with the managers\u2019 real team members in those fictitious scenarios.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, researchers asked participants to describe members of their staff, including their ethnicity, age, tenure, job performance, collegiality, commitment, and whether they enforce work-life boundaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, workers who took even small actions to detach from work during their designated time off were broadly seen as less committed and less promotable by their managers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s significant literature on how people are evaluated differently based on things like age, ethnicity, and gender, and we didn&#8217;t really find any of that,\u201d Buechel says. \u201cI can comfortably say this [detachment] penalty has equal, if not more significance than those other worker-related biases.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-give-me-a-break\">Give me a break</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With work-related stress and burnout rates <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91315114/report-69-of-workers-say-their-risk-of-burnout-is-moderate-to-high\">on the rise</a>, employees need more time to rest and recover, but research suggests they\u2019re getting less of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a recent <a href=\"https://makeheadway.com/blog/working-on-vacation-study/\">survey</a> of 2,000 American workers conducted by book summary app Headway, two-thirds of workers struggle to switch off on vacation, and more than half have experienced conflicts with loved ones over their inability to unplug while away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cJust 4% of workers are left alone on vacation; the rest get bombarded with emails, messages, and calls,\u201d says Thalia-Maria Tourikis, a health coach and burnout prevention and recovery expert for Headway. \u201cWorkers are encouraged to take time off, then pestered with emails and messages the moment they do, to the point of guilt, anxiety, insomnia, and burnout.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to technology, there are few physical barriers between employees and their increasingly digital workplaces. As a result, Tourikis says, many struggle to mentally detach from work, even when they\u2019re far from the office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTaking time off shouldn\u2019t feel like a sin,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we want to be healthier and happier, we have to stop glorifying constant availability and start respecting annual leave.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-small-breaks-can-make-a-big-difference\">Small breaks can make a big difference</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vacations have traditionally been considered an employee indulgence that came at the expense of their employers, but new research suggests the benefits are mutual, and more significant than previously understood.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe prevailing assumption was vacation offers small benefits for well-being, and they fade quickly when you get back to work,\u201d says Ryan Grant, a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Georgia who recently coauthored a <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2025-70561-001.html\">meta-analysis</a> on vacations and employee well-being. \u201cWe found the benefits were pretty huge.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grant explains that the energizing effects of time off are actually 85% greater than previously suggested, and those effects persisted much longer, fading gradually over an average of about 43 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the study, the most significant factor in determining the size and longevity of that post-vacation well-being boost was the ability to detach from work while&nbsp; away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt was the only recovery activity that had a strong positive association with well-being both during and after the vacation,\u201d Grant says. \u201cThat suggests the more you psychologically detach during vacation\u2014the less you check your email, communicate with coworkers, and just think about work generally\u2014the better your vacation is going to be, and the larger your well-being benefits are going to be after.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-detachment-offers-a-win-win-for-employees-and-managers\">Detachment offers a win-win for employees and managers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But this isn\u2019t just about enjoying that week in the sun or on the slopes. When workers can fully detach from work, their employers often benefit in the form of higher employee morale, resilience, and productivity, as well as lower healthcare costs, absenteeism, and turnover rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c[Managers] are trying to improve the organization\u2019s bottom line and improve employee performance, but not allowing people the time to detach and recover directly opposes that goal,\u201d Grant says. \u201cThey&#8217;re actually doing things that run directly counter to what they&#8217;re trying to accomplish.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the occasional late-night email or Saturday phone call may seem inconsequential in the moment, Grant says such actions leave workers in constant fear of having their downtime interrupted, making it harder to fully recharge while away from work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn the short term, you&#8217;re like, \u2018Well, I need this thing done today, so I&#8217;m going to email my subordinate and say I want them to do this thing tonight,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you look at things in the longer term, the more you&#8217;re not allowing people to detach on a daily basis, the more the negative effects on their health and performance are going to increase over time.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<hr />",

    "description": "<p>While working as a creative director at the nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.charitywater.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Charity: Water</a>, Tyler Riewer kept getting variations on the same question from other nonprofits: How had the organization built a wildly successful brand?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it launched in 2006, the nonprofit immediately <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40480193/5-ways-charity-water-uses-storytelling-to-inspire-more-giving\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">looked different</a> from traditional nonprofits. It was modern, optimistic, and radically transparent. It told personal stories that people wanted to share. It experimented with new ideas like peer-to-peer fundraising. To date, it\u2019s raised more than $1 billion for clean water projects around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The creative team freely offered advice, but they always wanted to be able to do more. That\u2019s why Riewer and three other former Charity: Water coworkers are now launching an agency of their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agency is called <a href=\"http://www.mutinyforgood.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mutiny</a>\u2014a name that\u2019s tongue in cheek but also represents what its founders genuinely feel, says Anthony Marinos, who previously led business development and partnerships at Charity: Water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe cannot sit idly by while others try to shape our world into something that we don\u2019t believe in,\u201d Marinos says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much negativity at the moment. We really feel like we can channel our expertise, our optimism, our excitement for this sector as a whole, to help uplift the messages and tell those stories that are often either being ignored or buried or going completely untold.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91366864\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/09-91366725-charity-water-branding.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Image: courtesy Mutiny]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A turning point came earlier this year. \u201cWe knew there was an opportunity to help share our expertise with the wider nonprofit community\u2014but the thing that really gave us purpose was the pressure being applied to the sector from the outside right now,\u201d Riewer says.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91366854\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/06-91366725-charity-water-branding.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><b>Kelly Herrington</b> and <b>Tyler Riewer</b> in Nepal for Charity: Water in 2022 [Photo: Cubby Graham/Charity: Water]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe were filming a video for Charity: Water in Ethiopia when the USAID cuts were announced earlier this year. We were in a woman\u2019s home, and behind her was a bag of flour with the words, \u2018From the American People.\u2019 That food saved lives and was one of the few reliable things when her country was going through civil war. And then bam .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gone overnight,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe just had this collective moment where we felt like \u2018doing good\u2019 was under attack. And we all felt an immediate obligation to do more.\u201d (Also, Charity: Water had relocated its headquarters from New York City to Nashville and was asking remote employees to move; the founders felt like the timing was right for them to go in a different direction.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91366853\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/03-91366725-charity-water-branding.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Image: Charity: Water]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For many nonprofits, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/branding\" title=\"Branding\">branding</a> is still an afterthought. That might be especially true now, as nonprofits face funding cuts while simultaneously dealing with the fallout from changing federal policy on everything from immigration to the environment. But it doesn\u2019t have to be expensive \u201cto arm small nonprofits who don\u2019t have much budget with tools that they need to be successful,\u201d Riewer says. Along with Riewer and Marinos, the founding team includes Kristina Brumby, a design director at Charity: Water, and Kelly Herrington, who was creative and video lead at the nonprofit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charity: Water launched after founder Scott Harrison\u2014previously a hard-partying nightclub promoter in New York City\u2014quit his job, volunteered in West Africa, and saw firsthand the devastating impact of polluted drinking water. When he returned to New York, Harrison asked friends at his next birthday party to donate money to help rebuild wells at a refugee camp in Uganda. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He documented the work in detail so that his friends would know where their money had gone. That idea helped spark the nonprofit, which later invited donors to host their own fundraising parties\u2014and which promised new transparency in showing how the nonprofit used funds. From the beginning, it presented itself differently than others in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of bleak photos of suffering children that make potential donors feel a sense of guilt, the organization focused on &#8220;after&#8221; images of people who were thriving, and used bright, optimistic branding. Charity: Water&#8217;s branding focused on storytelling, helping people feel an emotional connection with individuals whose lives changed because of clean water. And the nonprofit was early to embrace social media. The brand made donating feel cool and empowering. Harrison described his mission as &#8220;reinventing&#8221; charity.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91366851\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/01-91366725-charity-water-branding.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Image: Charity: Water]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That approach is still rare in the nonprofit world. Right now, the team says, the ads that are most successful at making someone have an emotional reaction tend to be for products, not causes. But that doesn\u2019t have to be the case. If an ad is for a dog food company, \u201cWhy did Farmer&#8217;s Dog make this ad instead of the ASPCA?\u201d Marinos asks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A nonprofit might not have the budget to buy ad space on streaming platforms. But if an ad genuinely connects with people, it can work just as well on YouTube. The Mutiny team plans to encourage clients to take risks and experiment with new messaging, the strategy that helped make Charity: Water successful. (One recent Charity: Water video, for example, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=wSpD3pER3Ng&amp;feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">starts with the words, &#8220;Charity sucks.\u201d</a> Another asks viewers to <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/1003235557/b2623bfb29\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">imagine that they&#8217;re a 6-year-old girl</a> growing up in poverty in a rural part of the developing world.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mutiny aims to work with a wide range of organizations, from local groups to national and international organizations. One of its first clients is <a href=\"https://www.hookuaaina.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ho\u2018okua\u2018\u0101ina</a>, a nonprofit in Hawaii that mentors youth on a farm growing traditional crops like taro.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91366856\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/05-91366725-charity-water-branding.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Filming for Ho\u2018okua\u2018\u0101ina, 2025 [Photo: Cubby Graham/courtesy Mutiny]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The thing that we&#8217;ve been hung up on lately is for-profit brands outspend nonprofits on advertising by 100 to 1,&#8221; Riewer says. &#8220;The answer is not necessarily that you need to throw money at this. It is, you need to see yourself as a competitor and you need to step on the field. You solve it by finding meaningful ways, human ways, to connect with people and tell your story. If you can do that, you can compete with the for-profit space.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riewer adds: \u201cWhy don&#8217;t world-changing organizations have world-class creative and strategy? We believe that they should and they can.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<hr />",

    "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91360480/working-parents-balance-ambition-guilt",
    "description": "<p>A few years ago, I met a woman at a networking event who whispered her confession over a plastic cup of chardonnay: \u201cI love my job. I\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve built. But every time I miss a school play or forget to sign a field trip form, I feel like I failed them.\u201d She didn\u2019t say who \u201cthem\u201d referred to. Perhaps her kids, society, herself. Maybe all three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That moment stuck with me because it symbolized the tension so many ambitious parents live with every day: The drive to achieve versus the guilt that comes from not always being present for our family. And let\u2019s be clear, this isn\u2019t just a working mom issue. Dads feel it. Stay-at-home parents with side hustles or passion projects feel it. Anyone who wants something outside of parenthood\u2014whether it\u2019s a promotion, a creative dream, or even just a regular workout routine\u2014knows that familiar battle between showing up for yourself and showing up for your kids.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-where-does-the-guilt-come-from\">Where does the guilt come from?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the root of this guilt. For many of us, especially women, ambition and parenting, have long been thought of as rival (if not warring) priorities. A parent who is all-in at work is assumed to be checked out at home. The culture tells us you can\u2019t be fully present in both places. And if you try, be prepared to be stretched thinner than a toddler\u2019s patience in a long checkout line.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Social media certainly doesn\u2019t help.\u00a0 While we\u2019re eating chips over our laptops, we scroll past moms packing bento box lunches with star-shaped cucumbers and love notes. We see dads coaching every Saturday soccer game while we\u2019re FaceTiming from a hotel room on yet another work trip. The comparison game is brutal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, guilt doesn\u2019t only come from comparing ourselves to the parents who treat lunch prep like a <em>Top Chef </em>challenge. It hits because we care. Ambitious parents aren\u2019t just chasing promotions, we\u2019re also chasing snuggles, bedtime stories, and the sense that we\u2019re nailing this whole \u201cbeing a present parent\u201d thing. So if we fall short, it feels like a dagger to the heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-it-possible-to-be-ambitious-and-a-great-parent\">Is it possible to be ambitious <em>and</em> a great parent?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The short answer is yes. But not without first redefining what \u201cgreat\u201d really looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a good parent isn\u2019t about being there for every single moment. It\u2019s about being there for the ones that matter most. You can miss the bake sale and still raise a kid that feels cared for and secure. What children need more than perfection is a realistic role model. They need to see what it looks like to pursue a dream, have challenges, set boundaries, and show up for the people you love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it\u2019s rooted in purpose, ambition teaches kids resilience, how to manage their time and what it looks like to care deeply about something. That doesn\u2019t mean we should be so focused on the next achievement that we miss what\u2019s happening right in front of us. The key is staying in sync\u2014pursuing your goals without neglecting your child\u2019s needs . . . or your own.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Ever since <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91361611/ai-chatbots-are-breaking-the-web-and-forcing-a-404-makeover\">AI chatbots arrived</a>, it feels as if the media has been on the losing end of a war of attrition. Chatbots are <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/06/25/34-of-us-adults-have-used-chatgpt-about-double-the-share-in-2023/\">surging in popularity</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91365800/reddit-support-groups-for-chatbot-addiction\">more people use AI</a> to get answers instead of search results, the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-ai-news-publishers-7e687141?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAg9DqQ54YzZk4iFUBmv5x7-SX8_AZWg01uXGYQ2Hjh08Tx_G-P7K70I-CWAfVg%3D&amp;gaa_ts=686e543e&amp;gaa_sig=lQdU_SLHn0kmKXda1pKDhPoEwknUCuANIQe3gIkz6ueu6hgLbS-9DvDiXSvkpxCGjb-BuIABFQwpCUvlKtQWSA%3D%3D\">fewer visits</a> to the websites that provide those answers. Even Google, whose business model depends on monetizing search, is <a href=\"https://mediacopilot.substack.com/p/goodbye-google-search-hello-ai-mode\">pushing deeper into AI</a>, and industry data shows <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> bots are <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91354919/internet-of-agents-rising-fast-publishers\">flourishing</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, actions have a habit of inspiring reactions. Lawsuits are mounting as more media companies take on the AI giants over copyright, which may yet prove decisive\u2014<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91362983/ai-copyright-cases-anthropic-meta-publishers\">recent rulings</a> notwithstanding. And publishers are increasing their website defenses against AI crawlers, blocking more of them than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we may have hit a tipping point: <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91269402/enterprise-most-innovative-companies-2025\">Cloudflare</a>, a major internet infrastructure provider, has taken a stand in the conflict. In an announcement designed for maximum impact, the company said it would begin <a href=\"https://cloudflare.net/news/news-details/2025/Cloudflare-Just-Changed-How-AI-Crawlers-Scrape-the-Internet-at-Large-Permission-Based-Approach-Makes-Way-for-A-New-Business-Model/default.aspx\">blocking AI scrapers by default</a> on the websites it manages. If you&#8217;re a site operator on Cloudflare&#8217;s network, you will now need to actively allow AI bots to index your content. If you don&#8217;t, they get blocked.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/latest/rss?truncated=true\">\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-clout-in-the-cloud\">Clout in the cloud</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloudflare manages about 20% of all internet traffic, so the implications of the move are significant. And so is the business opportunity: With the announcement, Cloudflare is also launching a marketplace for bot traffic. Instead of blocking AI bots completely, site owners will be able to charge them a fee for access via the new <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/paypercrawl-signup/\">Pay Per Crawl program</a>\u2014essentially a micropayment system. A few startups, such as <a href=\"https://tollbit.com/\">TollBit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/media/meet-scalepost-the-ai-firm-helping-perplexity-strike-deals-with-publishers/\">ScalePost</a>, operate similar systems, but considering CloudFlare&#8217;s scale, it may have instantly become their biggest competitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloudflare is a content delivery network (CDN), a crucial but largely invisible part of the internet to most users. A CDN will cache content to keep it closer to end users, generally speeding up web traffic. It runs many other related services, too\u2014things like preventing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, enabling secure connections, and hosting websites\u2014but mostly it&#8217;s a middleman between website visitors and website servers, optimizing delivery and ensuring security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way AI bots interact with websites is usually managed by each site&#8217;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt\">Robots Exclusion Protocol</a> (robots.txt), but it&#8217;s largely an honor system that depends on bots accurately identifying themselves and then following the rules, which they tend to liberally interpret. Cloudflare&#8217;s influence isn&#8217;t regulation per se, but it may give that standard some de facto teeth. The company claims it &#8220;identifies and distinguishes AI crawlers through its sophisticated bot detection system.&#8221; If that means Cloudflare can detect, trace, and perhaps even punish bad actors who ignore or bypass the protocol, it could mean the tides are turning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is the nagging reality of the other 80% of the internet. Other CDN giants, such as <a href=\"https://www.akamai.com/\">Akamai</a>, would need to get on board to really have an effect, but even that would only amount to about half of web activity. And large parts of the rest of the internet aren&#8217;t motivated to act: Google, Meta, and Microsoft operate much of the infrastructure that supports their massive, scalable businesses, and they&#8217;re all in the business of building AI models so they have an interest in maximizing AI crawler activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the pushback is real. Cloudflare&#8217;s announcement was deeply planned: the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2025/cloudflare-just-changed-how-ai-crawlers-scrape-the-internet-at-large/\">press release</a> includes quotes from dozens of media executives\u2014from <em>Time</em> to Dotdash Meredith and even content-based tech platforms like Quora. Although some in the group are media players who are suing AI companies, you get the sense that the others are using this moment to voice their own indignation at what they see as the wide-scale theft of the lifeblood of their industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That indignation is fueling a new consensus, which is reflected in the <a href=\"https://mediacopilot.substack.com/p/the-state-of-ai-content-licensing?utm_source=publication-search\">many content licensing deals</a> publishers have signed with AI companies over the past two years: that AI summarization should require some form of compensation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-monetizing-the-internet-of-bots\">Monetizing the internet of bots</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cloudflare news gives publishers a more solid foundation to not just mount a defense against AI bots, but to build on that consensus\u2014to turn the rising robot activity into an opportunity. A comprehensive strategy around the growing &#8220;internet of bots&#8221; should include three elements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Block or introduce a toll for AI scraping: </strong>Identifying bots is conceptually straightforward, but has practical challenges because they multiply and sometimes mask what they are.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Build for bots:</strong> Publishers should build a good user experience, and that goes for bots, too\u2014as long as they pay to get in. They should have real-time access to simply presented, accurate information to fuel the best possible summaries, with correct citations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Build branded AI experiences:</strong> For the people who do come to your site, give them a reason to stay. Going back to ChatGPT for every query isn&#8217;t ideal\u2014for anyone.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The third element is important because, while publishers are threatened by unscrupulous AI bots, they can&#8217;t deny that people still want to use them. AI answers remove friction and are changing expectations around search\u2014even site search. Publishers shouldn&#8217;t just acknowledge that, but take advantage of it to keep audiences on its own site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this depends on being able to separate bot traffic from human traffic. And if Cloudflare is indeed only the first CDN to make this move, there&#8217;s a hope that publishers won&#8217;t have to wait for a favorable court ruling or new regulations to get the teeth they need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is still a role that the government can play. Cloudflare&#8217;s sophisticated bot detection would have an even greater effect if it were illegal for bots to hide their true nature and try to pass for humans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a rule would be simple and strongly encourage a fairer information ecosystem, one where publishers can start designing the right experiences for the right audiences. If the future of websites is to serve up the best experience to a bot, they should at least have clarity on what that is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/latest/rss?truncated=true\">",

Increasingly, influencers advise delaying your first hit of tea or coffee for anywhere between 30 and 90 minutes after you wake up \u2013 the rationale being that caffeine mostly works by blocking the brain\u2019s receptors for a molecule called adenosine, which ordinarily promotes relaxation by slowing down neural activity. Adenosine levels are at their lowest when you wake up, and so in theory, you might be \u201cwasting\u201d your first brew of the day by glugging it when there\u2019s nothing for the caffeine to block. This seems plausible, but it\u2019s also worth noting that caffeine\u2019s effects take about 10 minutes to kick in, and it\u2019s about 45 minutes before levels peak in the bloodstream. Caffeine\u2019s also not <em>just</em> good for getting you going: if you\u2019re planning a workout or a morning walk, it can help things along by <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31793465/\">producing feelgood endorphins</a> and increasing the amount of fat <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/ExerciseAndAthleticPerformance-HealthProfessional/#caffeine\">you\u2019re able to burn.</a> Some people suggest that waiting a while before your first cup helps to avoid afternoon drowsiness, but according to <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10930107/\">an evaluation of the scientific literature</a> published last year, \u201cThere is no evidence that caffeine ingestion upon waking is somehow responsible for an afternoon \u2018crash\u2019.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/14/terrible-nights-sleep-heres-how-to-make-it-through-the-day-and-maybe-even-enjoy-it-one-step-at-a-time\">Continue reading...</a>",

More than 100 people died, most by drowning in floodwaters or being crushed by water-fueled landslides.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe had no idea it was going to do what it did,\u201d said Jeff Howell, the now-retired emergency manager in Yancey County, North Carolina, a rural expanse that suffered the most deaths per capita. </p>\n\n<p>A week ago, the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry slipped up from the coast of Mexico, drawing moisture from the Gulf, then collided with another system and inundated rivers and creeks in hilly south central Texas. More than 100 people are confirmed dead, many of them children, with more missing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe had no reason to believe that this was going to be anything like what\u2019s happened here \u2014 none whatsoever,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdnTaQAJkQo\">County Judge Rob Kelly</a>, the top elected official in Kerr County, Texas, where most of the deaths occurred.</p>\n\n<p>The similarities between North Carolina and Texas extend beyond the words of these two officials. In both disasters, there was a disconnect between accurate weather alerts and on-the-ground action that could have saved lives. </p>\n\n<p>Officials in each of those places were warned. The National Weather Service sent urgent alerts about potentially life-threatening danger <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/texas-july-4-flood-timeline-ddf1090207b67c6ab716aedc8b239fc2\">hours in advance of the flash floods</a>, leaving time to notify and try to evacuate people in harm\u2019s way. </p>\n\n<p>In Texas, some local officials did just that. But others did not.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/hurricane-helene-evacuation-warnings-yancey-county-north-carolina\">a ProPublica investigation found</a> that when Helene hit on Sept. 27, some local officials in North Carolina issued evacuation orders. At least five counties in Helene\u2019s path, including Yancey, did not. Howell said the enormity of the storm was far worse than anyone alive had ever seen and that he notified residents as best he could.</p>\n\n<p>The National Weather Service described Helene\u2019s approach for days. It sent out increasingly dire alerts warning of dangerous flash flooding and landslides. Its staff spoke directly with local emergency managers and held webinar updates. A Facebook message <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NWSGSP/posts/pfbid0GkYCwtugC5ji2wS78dc91wV7o2BvA27TB3s8KcRbeiZpFvBni7ybB3WZ5VAtMWUql?rdid=0JXL2DwWfIovOSMI\">the regional office posted</a> around 1 p.m. the day before Helene hit warned of \u201csignificant to catastrophic, life-threatening flooding\u201d in the mountains. \u201cThis will be one of the most significant weather events to happen in the western portions of the area in the modern era.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, in Texas, the weather service warned of potential for flash flooding the day before. Also that day, the state emergency management agency\u2019s regional director had \u201cpersonally contacted\u201d county judges, mayors and others \u201cin that area and notified them all of potential flooding,\u201d Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick later said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGkqVruBc9Y\">at a press conference</a>. </p>\n\n<p>AccuWeather, a commercial weather forecasting service, issued the first flash flood warning in Kerr County at 12:44 a.m. on July 4, roughly three hours before the catastrophic flooding. A half-hour later, <a href=\"https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/wx/afos/p.php?pil=FFWEWX&amp;e=202507040614\">at 1:14 a.m.</a>, the National Weather Service sent a similar warning to two specific areas, including central Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River\u2019s banks and hills are dotted with vacation homes, summer camps and campgrounds \u2014 many filled with July 4 vacationers slumbering in cabins and RVs.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFlash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly,\u201d the weather service alert said. Impacts could include \u201clife threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A severity descriptor on that alert sent it to weather radios and the nation\u2019s Wireless Emergency Alerts system, which blasts weather warnings to cellphones to blare an alarm.</p>\n\n<p>AccuWeather\u2019s chief meteorologist, Jonathan Porter, was dismayed to hear news later that all the children attending youth camps in Kerr County had not been ushered to higher ground despite those warnings.</p>\n\n<p>At Camp Mystic, a beloved century-old Christian summer camp for girls, at least 27 campers and counselors were killed. Six still haven\u2019t been found. Its director also died, while trying to rescue children. (People at the camp said they received little to no help from the authorities, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/us/texas-flood-local-response.html\">The New York Times</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was very concerned to see that campers were awoken not by someone coming to tell them to evacuate based on timely warnings issued but rather by rapidly rising water that was going up to the second level of their bunkbeds,\u201d Porter said. </p>\n\n<p>In the area, known as Flash Flood Alley, Porter called this \u201ca tragedy of the worst sort\u201d because it appeared camps and local officials could have mobilized sooner in response to the alerts.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere was plenty of time to evacuate people to higher ground,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThe question is, Why did that not happen?\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>But Dalton Rice, city manager of Kerrville, the county seat, said at a press conference the next day that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/05/texas-flooding-updates-guadalupe-river-camp-mystic/84477734007/\">there wasn\u2019t a lot of time</a>\u201d to communicate the risk to camps because the floodwaters rose so rapidly.</p>\n\n<p>Rice said that at 3:30 a.m. \u2014 more than two hours after the flash flood warnings began \u2014 he went jogging near the Guadalupe River to check it out but didn\u2019t see anything concerning. </p>\n\n<p>But 13 miles upriver from the park where he was jogging, the river began \u2014 <a href=\"https://water.noaa.gov/gauges/08165500\">at 3:10 a.m</a>. \u2014 to rise 25 feet in just two hours.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/vtec/?year=2025&amp;wfo=KEWX&amp;phenomena=FF&amp;significance=W&amp;eventid=38&amp;tab=textdata&amp;radar=USCOMP&amp;radar_product=N0Q&amp;radar_time=202507040815\">At 4:03 a.m.</a>, the weather service upgraded the warning to an \u201cemergency\u201d\u2014 its most severe flash flood alert \u2014 with a tag of \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d It singled out the Guadalupe River at Hunt in Kerr County: \u201cThis is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The local sheriff said he wasn\u2019t made aware of the flooding until 4 to 5 a.m. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/texas-officials-give-answers-growing-questions-response-kerr-county-de-rcna217515\">He has declined to say</a> whether the local emergency manager, who is responsible for alerting the public to approaching storms, was awake when the flash flood warnings went out starting at 1 a.m. <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/07/08/texas-weather-service-warning-kerr-county/\">The Texas Tribune reported</a> that Kerrville\u2019s mayor said he wasn\u2019t aware of the flooding until around 5:30 a.m., when the city manager called and woke him up. </p>\n\n<p>Local officials <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/10/us/kerr-country-officials-response-texas-flooding\">have refused to provide more details</a>, saying they are focused on finding the more than 100 people still missing and notifying loved ones of deaths.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            First image: Hurricane Helene\u2019s aftermath in Asheville, North Carolina, last September. Second image: A search-and-rescue worker looks through debris on July 6 after flash flooding in Hunt, Texas.\n    \n            (First image: Sean Rayford/Getty Images. Second image: Jim Vondruska/Getty Images)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>One challenge as disasters approach is that weather alerts often don\u2019t reach the people in harm\u2019s way.</p>\n\n<p>In rural areas across Texas and North Carolina alike, cellphone service can be spotty on the best of days, and some people turn off alert notifications. In North Carolina\u2019s remote mountains, many people live at least somewhat off the grid. The cell service isn\u2019t great everywhere, and many aren\u2019t glued to phones or social media. In Texas, Kerr County residents posted on Facebook complaints that they didn\u2019t receive the weather service\u2019s alerts while others said their phones blared all night with warnings. </p>\n\n<p>Many counties also use apps to send their own alerts, often tailored to their specific rivers and roads. But residents must opt in to receive them. Kerr County uses CodeRed, but it isn\u2019t clear what alerts it sent out overnight. </p>\n\n<p>Pete Jensen has spent a long career in emergency management, including responding to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack. He served as an official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency during Hurricane Katrina and often ponders why more people don\u2019t receive \u2013 and heed \u2013 weather alerts.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of denial,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cDisasters happen to someone else. They don\u2019t happen to me.\u201d That can include local officials who \u201cdon\u2019t always understand what their responsibilities are. They very often react like most humans do \u2013 in denial.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>There is one big difference between the disasters in Texas and North Carolina. In Texas, residents, journalists and others have demanded accountability from local officials. Gov. Greg Abbott has called the Legislature into special session starting July 21 to discuss flood warning systems, flood emergency communications and natural disaster preparation. </p>\n\n<p>But that hasn\u2019t happened in North Carolina. The state legislature has yet to discuss possible changes, such as expanding its Know Your Zone evacuation plan beyond the coast, or <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/fema-grants-trump-emergencies\">boost funding</a> for local emergency managers. (Instead, lawmakers went home in late June without passing <a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article309506565.html\">a full budget</a>.) Many emergency managers, including in Yancey County, operate in rural areas with small tax bases and skeleton staffs. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere still has not been an outcry here for, How do we do things differently?\u201d said state Sen. Julie Mayfield, a Democrat from Asheville. \u201cIt still feels like we\u2019re very much in recovery mode.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>North Carolina\u2019s emergency management agency <a href=\"https://www.ncdps.gov/division/emergency-management/ts-helene-after-action-review/open\">commissioned a review</a> of its handling of the disaster. The report found the state agency severely understaffed, but it didn\u2019t examine issues such as evacuations or local emergency managers\u2019 actions before Helene hit.</p>\n\n<p>Erika Andresen also lives in Asheville, a mountain city in the heart of Helene\u2019s destruction, where she helps businesses prepare for disasters. A lawyer and former Army judge advocate, she also teaches emergency management. After Helene, she was among the few voices in North Carolina <a href=\"https://www.eaasc.com/post/they-didn-t-tell-me-why-you-need-an-expert-to-survive-helene\">criticizing the lack of evacuations</a> and other inactions ahead of the storm. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI knew right away, both from my instinct and from my experience, that a lot of things went terribly wrong,\u201d Andresen said. When she got pushback against criticizing local authorities in a time of crisis, she countered, \u201cWe need accountability.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><strong>Clarification, July 11, 2025:</strong> This story has been clarified to specify where AccuWeather issued the first flash flood warning.</p>",

    "description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\u201cTo each there comes in their lifetime a special moment when they are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing\u2026\u201d</em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> \u2014 Winston S. Churchill</p><p><strong>OPINION</strong> -- Winston Churchill would have recognized the current situation in the U.S. relationship with Russia as a unique opportunity to make a mark on history. </p><p>Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin reaffirmed Moscow\u2019s war intentions in Ukraine, saying he considered Russians and Ukrainians to be one people and, \u201cin that sense the whole of Ukraine is ours.\u201d In the past two weeks, Putin has intensified Russia\u2019s drone and missile attacks across Ukraine putting heavy strain on Ukrainian air defenses. The Russian president is evidently of the view that Ukraine\u2019s defenses may be on the verge of collapse and that he can achieve his war ambitions through force.</p><p>Putin has cleverly played his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, whispering intentions of ending the war through negotiation and counting on Trump\u2019s desire for peace to push Ukraine into a deal that would essentially amount to surrender. But Putin has never once deviated from his maximalist goals in the war, in fact, he has only reaffirmed them at every opportunity. Russian participation in negotiations with Ukraine were quickly proven to be a form of \u2018maskirovka\u2019 (successful operations that mislead the enemy).</p><p>Now, Putin has intensified a bombing campaign clearly designed to target civilian infrastructure with the intent of both killing and demoralizing the Ukrainian people, and undermining support for the war and for the government in Kyiv.</p><p>Trump and his team seem to have finally arrived at the realization that they have been taken for a ride by Putin. The U.S. president recently characterized discussions with the Russian leader as \u201cmeaningless,\u201d saying, \u201cWe get a lot of bullsh*t thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth.\u201d (President Trump is not known for understatement. This may be the exception.)</p><p>Following his most recent call with Putin and a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump decided to resume sending some air defense interceptors and precision-guided bombs and missiles to Ukraine after last month\u2019s halt. This is a positive development but it is not enough. </p><p>Now is the critical moment to show strength, unity, and resolve to support the people of Ukraine. The U.S. President should not let himself be distracted by any suggestion relayed by Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov to Secretary of State Rubio after the two exchanged views on new ideas for Ukraine peace talks. (Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.)</p><p>The people of Ukraine understand better than anyone, the existential nature of Putin\u2019s aggression. They see what Russia is doing by kidnapping Ukrainian children and sending them to the territory of the Russian Federation. They see the elimination of Ukrainian language instruction in schools in areas Russia occupies. They see the dreadful, starved and tortured condition of Ukrainian soldiers who are returned in prisoner exchanges. For Ukraine, surrender or conquest means extermination. To end this, more military, economic and political assistance is required.</p><p>The decision by the U.S. to participate in the recent \u201cCoalition of the Willing\u201d meeting is another step in the right direction. U.S. participation sends an important message to our allies and to Putin. Trump should immediately take other actions to send Putin and the world a clear message of support for the victim in this conflict, Ukraine. </p><p>A good first step would be to support legislation sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal that targets Russia and countries that purchase Russian hydrocarbon products with stiff sanctions. The full range of available weapons systems should also be fast-tracked for delivery to Ukraine. Restrictions on their use in targeting military installations in the territory of the Russian Federation should be immediately removed. And high priority in that target set should be the factories that produce the Shahed drones that are now being used as weapons of terror against Ukrainian civilians.</p><p>President Trump should take a big picture view of the world Putin has created and the actual state of play of the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d that Putin has built. </p><p>In December of 2024, one of the key players in the Axis, former Syrian President Basher al Assad, saw his government collapse and he fled to exile in Moscow. Since October 2023, Israel has ruthlessly dismantled favored surrogates of the Axis, including Hamas and Hezbollah. The U.S. used military force to attack another favorite surrogate of Iran, the Houthis in Yemen. And in June, Israel conducted a number of stunningly effective attacks against Iran\u2019s nuclear program, military leadership, scientists, air defenses and other important targets. </p><p>Significantly, the U.S. joined Israel in conducting attacks against nuclear targets in Iran thereby demonstrating a commitment to use powerful elements of the U.S. military against a critical member of Putin\u2019s alliance. Note that all of these actions against Putin\u2019s axis received barely a peep from the great dictator in the Kremlin, much less a military response. Putin\u2019s axis is in serious trouble.</p><p>Russia\u2019s military is fully engaged in the fight against Ukraine, leaving Moscow with very little response. Estimates suggest that Russia has suffered a million casualties (killed, wounded, captured, missing) in the conflict thus far. All for the gain of a few hundred kilometers of Ukrainian territory. </p><p>The cost to Russia\u2019s economy has been similarly catastrophic. Inside his government, the mysterious deaths and suicides of regime officials and oligarchs\u2014even some considered to be Putin supporters - has got to be sending a message to those remaining - that no one is safe. The key piece in the puzzle that could bring Putin the fate he deserves is resolve from the U.S. President. </p><p>Ukraine was given just enough support not to lose against Russia under President Joe Biden, but never enough support to actually win and end this war. President Trump, you have the opportunity to show the world that you are the winning president.</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

His administration had taken extensive steps to improve relations with the Jewish community, had enacted strict rules on protests and had communicated all of that to the OCR during a previous antisemitism investigation that remained open. </p>\n\n<p>By the next day, though, there were signs that the new investigation was part of a coordinated campaign to oust him. </p>\n\n<p>One piece of evidence: the speed with which conservative news outlets reported on the OCR\u2019s action, which hadn\u2019t been publicly announced. The OCR letter was embedded in a July 2 article published by a right-wing news outlet, <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/campus/trump-administration-launches-civil-rights-probe-into-anti-semitism-at-george-mason-university/\">The Washington Free Beacon</a>. The next day, the City Journal<em>,</em> published by the influential and conservative Manhattan Institute, ran an <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/george-mason-university-president-gregory-washington-dei-anti-semitism\">opinion essay</a> headlined \u201cGeorge Mason University\u2019s Disastrous President.\u201d The article accused Washington, the university\u2019s first Black president and a first-generation college graduate, of backing \u201cracially discriminatory DEI programs\u201d \u2014 referring to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts \u2014 and failing to address campus antisemitism. It concluded that \u201cWashington\u2019s track record warrants his resignation or dismissal.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The similarities to recent events at another public university in Virginia were hard to ignore. The OCR\u2019s George Mason investigation was opened just four days after the University of Virginia\u2019s president, James E. Ryan, <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/university-of-virginia-president-reportedly-resigns-under-pressure-from-trump-administration\">announced that he was resigning</a> to help settle a federal probe into the university\u2019s DEI commitments.</p>\n\n<p>That happened after a group of conservative University of Virginia alumni, the <a href=\"https://jeffersoncouncil.org/\">Jefferson Council</a>, published blog entries and newspaper ads decrying the president \u2014 in part for focusing too heavily on diversity efforts \u2014 and demanding that he resign. The council\u2019s connections to board members and Justice Department lawyers led many observers in higher education to conclude that Ryan\u2019s forced resignation was the result of a coordinated assault.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Washington is feeling the same heat coming from similar sources.</p>\n\n<p>The temperature cranked up several degrees Thursday morning, when the Education Department notified George Mason that it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-opens-title-vi-investigation-george-mason-university\">opening a second investigation</a> \u2014 this one alleging the university illegally considers race in hiring and promoting employees. The department said it was acting on complaints from \u201cmultiple professors\u201d at GMU.</p>\n\n<p>In a press statement Thursday, Craig Trainor, the Education Department\u2019s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, suggested that the agency has already reached sweeping conclusions about the university\u2019s hiring practices. \u201cDespite the leadership of George Mason University claiming that it does not discriminate on the basis of race, it appears that its hiring and promotion policies and practices from 2020 to the present, implemented under the guise of so-called \u2018Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion,\u2019 not only allow but champion illegal racial preferencing in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This kind of pernicious and wide-spread discrimination \u2014 packaged as \u2018anti-racism\u2019 \u2014 was allowed to flourish under the Biden Administration, but it will not be tolerated by this one,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n\n<p>The university <a href=\"https://www.gmu.edu/news/2025-07/statement-regarding-new-title-vi-investigation\">rebutted those accusations in a statement</a> saying it is complying with all federal and state mandates and does not discriminate. The university \u201creceived a new Department of Education letter of investigation this morning as it was simultaneously released to news outlets, which is unprecedented in our experience,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAs always, we will work in good faith to give a full and prompt response.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, dozens of Jewish faculty members at GMU have signed on to a statement condemning \u201can attack on our university community and our GMU President that is quickly intensifying under a false, racially divisive, and deeply cynical claim of combating antisemitism.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Even before Thursday\u2019s announcement, Washington said he had detected a pattern that\u2019s been playing out at other universities targeted by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration: Multiple investigations are filed in quick succession and word leaks to news organizations.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt seems like this is orchestrated,\u201d Washington said during an interview Wednesday. \u201cThe same people who are kind of aligned that got rid of Jim Ryan are aligned against me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He finds the timing of the attacks against him and his university troubling.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGiven that the Office for Civil Rights doesn\u2019t publicly announce who is under investigation, we were wondering how these conservative outlets even got the information in the first place,\u201d Washington said. The \u201calmost hateful discussions of me\u201d in the City Journal article looked like \u201ca concerted effort to try to paint the institution in a negative light.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Washington said the piece seemed to be urging the Trump administration to take the investigation to the next level, the Department of Justice, which could levy punishments against the university.</p>\n\n<p>Many faculty members at George Mason agree. They worry that despite the OCR\u2019s insistence in its letter to the university that its investigation will be unbiased, the Trump administration has already reached a verdict on the institution\u2019s president and wants him out. As evidence, they point to a <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/could-george-mason-u-be-republicans-test-case-for-project-2025\">web of ties</a> between right-wing news organizations and politicians \u2014 including Virginia\u2019s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin \u2014 as well as some George Mason board members. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe same unfounded and coordinated attacks that pushed Ryan out of UVa are now being leveled at GMU President Greg Washington,\u201d the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors <a href=\"https://aaupmason.org/\">wrote in an online post</a>. \u201cWe think the DOJ, Governor Youngkin, and Youngkin\u2019s appointees\u201d to GMU\u2019s governing board \u201care trying to force President Washington out so they can hire an ideological ally who will impose the Governor\u2019s political ideologies on Mason\u2019s governance and curriculum.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Late Wednesday, Virginia\u2019s two Democratic U.S. senators, Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine, doubled down on those warnings, publishing an <a href=\"https://article.wn.com/view/2025/07/10/Kaine_Warner_Virginia_must_resist_Trumps_attacks_on_higher_e/\">opinion piece</a> in the Richmond Times-Dispatch saying that the Trump administration \u201cappears to be eyeing its next target\u201d with George Mason\u2019s president.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe accusations \u2014 which are pushed by bloggers with ties to ultra-conservative groups with histories of false claims about Mason and advocacy for the removal of university presidents \u2014 are eerily similar to those lodged against Ryan,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThey include vague and politically charged accusations centered around \u2018DEI\u2019 and suggestions that the university\u2019s administration has been insufficiently responsive to concerns raised by Jewish students about their safety on campus. That\u2019s despite the fact that the university\u2019s leaders have repeatedly and publicly condemned antisemitism and actually been praised by the local <a href=\"https://jcouncil.org/statements/joint-jcrc-statement-mason-hillel-recent-events-involving-george-mason-university\">Jewish Relations Council and campus Hillel</a> for their leadership and commitment to Jewish members of Mason\u2019s community.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The education department\u2019s July 1 letter <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/correct-letter-gmu.pdf\">notified</a> George Mason that it was investigating a complaint, filed in June, that Jewish students and faculty members faced a hostile environment at the Virginia university between October 2023 and the end of the 2024-2025 academic year. It gave the university until July 21 to turn over voluminous information about its response to antisemitism complaints. </p>\n\n<p>It also assured the university it would take a neutral stance in evaluating the information.</p>\n\n<p>Warner and Kaine are skeptical that the investigation will be fair and impartial: In their opinion piece, they said it\u2019s more likely \u201cto serve as yet another smokescreen to punish universities and leaders who don\u2019t align with their ideological goals.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Some George Mason faculty members share these concerns. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen you start seeing these hit pieces come out one after another in a matter of days, you know it\u2019s coordinated,\u201d Bethany L. Letiecq, a professor in the College of Education and Human Development, said in an interview. </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, higher education leaders have <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/its-punishment-for-the-sake-of-punishment\">accused</a> the Department of Justice\u2019s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, which officially oversees investigations by several federal agencies, of ignoring procedures intended to provide due process, <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/newsletter/academe-today/2025-04-29\">racing</a> toward predetermined results, and then punishing universities by stripping them of billions of research dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Washington\u2019s critics have ties to right-wing advocates of eliminating diversity efforts and other examples of what they see as higher education\u2019s \u201cwoke\u201d policies. The author of the essay calling Washington a \u201cdisastrous\u201d president, Ian Kingsbury, has <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/education/report/the-woke-capture-charter-schools\">co-published articles</a> promoting <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/gender-affirming-care-type-2-diabetes-crisis\">conservative causes</a> with Jay P. Greene, a senior research fellow with The Heritage Foundation. Christopher F. Rufo, one of the nation\u2019s most aggressive and influential opponents of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, is among the contributing editors at City Journal<em>.</em></p>\n\n<p>Such critics are well represented in George Mason\u2019s leadership as well. </p>\n\n<p>Youngkin, the governor, appointed most of GMU\u2019s governing board, known as the board of visitors. The university\u2019s general counsel, <a href=\"https://www.highereddive.com/news/virginia-ag-elevates-wife-of-gop-donor-to-george-masons-interim-top-legal/617977/\">Anne Gentry</a>, is married to a longtime conservative activist and executive with the Koch Foundation, Letiecq pointed out. \u201cAt Mason, the foxes are in the henhouse,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an inside job.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Letiecq worries that Youngkin might exert the same kind of influence that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a fellow Republican, has in trying to reshape higher education to fit a conservative playbook. Neither Youngkin nor the board of visitors immediately responded to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI have suspected that Youngkin, in his quest for political capital, has been following the DeSantis playbook and sees Mason as a potential New College that they can take over and take down,\u201d she said. New College of Florida, once a progressive institution, <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-college-that-conservatives-took-over\">underwent substantial changes to its curriculum and staff</a> beginning in 2023 when DeSantis stacked its board with conservative members. </p>\n\n<p>Neither Kingsbury, the author of the City Journal piece, nor the Department of Education responded to inquiries about the patterns Washington saw. Eliana Johnson, editor of the Washington Free Beacon, said in a statement that \u201cour reporting speaks for itself.\u201d City Journal did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Washington defended his record in a public <a href=\"https://president.gmu.edu/news/2025-07/george-mason-affirms-its-measures-ensure-safe-and-welcoming-campus-response-new\">statement</a> on July 3. \u201cAs we prepare a response to the complaint, it is important that we all have an accurate understanding of how safe and welcoming the George Mason community is, particularly as we prepare to welcome tens of thousands of students to campus in just a few short weeks,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGeorge Mason has not been marred by the sort of violence that has rocked so many other campuses elsewhere in Virginia and around the nation following the Hamas attacks of 2023. It is a distinction we are proud of, and work hard each day to maintain.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In 11 messages that were sent to the campus community detailing the university\u2019s responses to the Hamas attacks and that were shared with The Chronicle of Higher Education<em>,</em> his office denounced \u201ccraven acts of terrorism as we have seen in Israel,\u201d urged \u201ccivil discourse, understanding, and peaceable assembly\u201d on campus and denounced the \u201cdisgusting behavior\u201d of those who were attempting to distribute antisemitic leaflets. University leaders coordinated with law enforcement to respond to two violent antisemitic actions. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s been more than a year since the last campus demonstration related to Gaza, Washington said. That protest remained safe and legal and did not disrupt university business. \u201cNo encampments have ever formed at George Mason, and we will not permit them in the future,\u201d Washington said. The university was one of the first to introduce a comprehensive safety and well-being plan, which remains in effect.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur data continues to show that our environment has dramatically improved since the horrific Hamas attacks of 2023, so we are perplexed to be receiving this investigation at this time. Nevertheless, we will respond in a forthright, direct, and timely manner to this and any inquiry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In the 2023-2024 academic year, the university received 31 bias-incident reports based on antisemitism, according to Rose Pascarell, vice president for university life. Last year, that number dropped to 12.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, she said, the university \u201cresponded fully\u201d to a previous OCR complaint related to antisemitism \u2014 but never heard back from the government.</p>\n\n<p>Letiecq said that, in her view, Washington has overreacted, not underreacted, to complaints of antisemitism, instituting restrictions on protests and punishments for protesters that she considers \u201coppressive.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is an insatiable campaign on the right and it seems there\u2019s nothing you can do to satisfy them,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>George Mason, with more than 40,000 students, is the most <a href=\"https://news.gmu.edu/news/2021-07/secrets-out-mason-virginias-most-diverse-public-university\">racially diverse public research university</a> in the state, university officials say. To comply with Trump\u2019s executive orders, the university has repurposed its DEI office to focus on compliance and community. It has cut six positions, eliminated diversity training and expanded a program in constructive dialogue. All of those changes are outlined in a lengthy report to the board. Washington insists, though, that the university won\u2019t abandon its commitments to the underlying principles its diversity efforts support.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen you are a diverse institution, you have to operate from that diverse framework,\u201d Washington said. \u201cI don\u2019t run away from that. I run toward it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>DEI expenditures represent 0.1% of the university\u2019s budget, GMU officials say.</p>\n\n<p>Asked why he agreed to speak out publicly when so many presidents have stayed silent to avoid angering the administration, Washington said the attacks were too personal to avoid.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMy philosophy is: Sunlight is disinfectant. We\u2019re going to be transparent with the community throughout the process,\u201d including the back-and-forth with OCR, he said. </p>\n\n<p>Washington says if the university is asked to make significant changes without a standard investigation and discussion of the facts, it will deal with that as necessary. \u201cWe will work in good faith to move through this,\u201d Washington said. \u201cWe will know if we\u2019re given due process by how they manage our particular case.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Katherine Mangan is a senior writer at The Chronicle of Higher Education.</p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"byline\">\n                by <a class=\"name\" href=\"https://www.adn.com/author/kyle-hopkins/\">Kyle Hopkins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.adn.com/\">Anchorage Daily News</a>                </p>\n                                             \n\n        \n                        <p>This article was produced for ProPublica\u2019s Local Reporting Network in partnership with the Anchorage Daily News. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/dispatches\">Sign up for Dispatches</a> to get our stories in your inbox every week.</p>\n\n        \n\n    \n      \n  \n\n\n\n                    \n<p>Anchorage Mayor Suzanne LaFrance said this week that the city has hired a full roster of prosecutors and is no longer dropping criminal charges due to short staffing. The announcement comes nine months after the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/criminal-case-dismissals-anchorage-alaska\">Anchorage Daily News and ProPublica reported</a> the mass dismissals.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPublic safety begins with accountability \u2014 and we cannot hold people accountable if we don\u2019t have prosecutors in court,\u201d LaFrance said in a news release, announcing that Alaska\u2019s largest city has filled all \u201cfrontline\u201d prosecutor jobs for the first time since 2020. \u201cThis was about more than filling positions. It was about rebuilding the systems that keep Anchorage safe.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>An investigation by the newsrooms, published in October, found that city prosecutors dropped hundreds of misdemeanor cases because there weren\u2019t enough attorneys on the payroll. Between May 1 and Oct. 2 of last year, the city dropped more than 250 domestic violence assault cases and more than 270 drunken driving cases due to an inability to meet the 120-day deadline Alaska sets for upholding a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial. </p>\n\n<p>Days after the investigation came out, the state of Alaska announced it would help prosecute city cases to avoid speedy-trial dismissals. </p>\n\n<p>But those state prosecutors are no longer needed. According to the city, the municipal prosecutor\u2019s office now has a full staff of 12 \u201cfrontline\u201d prosecutors who take cases to trial, plus a supervisor and an attorney who files motions and appeals. The only vacancy, they said, is a supervisory role: deputy municipal prosecutor. </p>\n\n<p>That amounts to a vacancy rate of about 7% in the prosecutor\u2019s office. In contrast, more than 40% of city prosecutor positions were vacant as of mid-2024, according to a city spokesperson.</p>\n\n<p>At a Wednesday \u201ctrial call\u201d hearing at downtown Anchorage\u2019s Boney Courthouse, Assistant Municipal Prosecutor Andy Garbe announced the city was ready to go to trial in case after case, including a drunken driving arrest, weapons charges and domestic violence assaults. It was a far different scene from September, when prosecutors were routinely forced to drop charges in cases nearing the speedy-trial deadline.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not in the position we were last fall,\u201d Garbe said, referring to the forced dismissals. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening anymore.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>City prosecutors said they are still dismissing cases for reasons other than speedy-trial deadlines. For example, on Wednesday, Garbe moved to dismiss two cases, including a domestic violence assault, citing factors such as the weakness of the case and unavailable witnesses. A defense attorney had warned the cases were nearing the 120-day speedy-trial deadline, but Garbe said the timing was not the reason for the dismissals.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>In Anchorage, city prosecutors handle misdemeanor cases while state attorneys generally prosecute felonies. </p>\n\n<p>With the most serious felonies, the state has long dealt with problems apart from Anchorage\u2019s mass dismissals. The newsrooms reported in January that <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/anchorage-alaska-pretrial-delays-sexual-assault\">some of those cases</a> are delayed <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/alaska-sex-assault-case-delays-timeline/\">as long as a decade</a> before reaching trial. In March, the Alaska Supreme Court issued a <a href=\"https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/crime-courts/2025/03/25/alaska-supreme-court-places-new-limits-on-pretrial-delays/\">series of orders</a> aimed at reducing delays. </p>\n\n<p>District Court Judge Brian Clark cited the Supreme Court orders on Wednesday when asking attorneys if they were ready to go to trial, noting the pending deadline.</p>",

He received 45 years in the Illinois Department of Corrections and will have to serve 100% of his sentence.</p>\n        <p>According to prosecutors, on Sept. 6, 2024, police responded to a report of a woman who shot herself and found Halcomb \"lying in a pool of blood on the stairwell landing with a gun in her hand.\" She sustained one gunshot wound to the neck and was pronounced deceased.</p>\n        <p>Investigators uncovered evidence suggesting Halcomb didn\u2019t end her own life, including a blood trail that revealed her body was likely moved. In the downstairs bedroom, authorities also reportedly discovered a Post-it note that said, \"I, Mary Elyce Halcomb, promise to never break Nathaniel Archuleta\u2019s heart, and if I do, Nathaniel Archuleta has every right to euthanize me, vice versa, I love you.\"</p>\n        <p>Prosecutors said Archuleta provided inconsistent statements during the investigation. He reportedly first said his girlfriend\u2019s death was a suicide, and then he claimed he was cleaning his gun when it accidentally went off. According to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, Archuleta later confessed to an inmate \"that he shot Mary because he caught her texting another man.\"</p>\n        <p>During the defendant\u2019s plea hearing, prosecutors said the victim\u2019s family members and loved ones were present, and they \"tearfully described the emotional toll her death had caused them. They spoke of sleepless nights, nightmares, and persistent heartbreak.\"</p>\n        <p>According to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, loved ones described \"struggling with trust, fear, depression, and anxiety.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/4202494/remarks-by-secretary-of-defense-pete-hegseth-at-the-2025-shangri-la-dialogue-in/\" target=\"_blank\">warned recently</a> that an invasion \"could be imminent\", saying at a summit in Singapore at the end of May, that \"There's no reason to sugarcoat it: the threat China poses is real.\" The Defense Secretary also said that Beijing is \"credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific,\" adding, \"to be clear: any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world.\" Hegseth is not alone in believing that a Chinese invasion is inevitable as part of President Xi Jinping\u2019s plan to \u201cre-unify\u201d the island with mainland China. But it is also just part of a much broader strategy that long-term, poses significantly higher stakes.</p><p>As a result of the threat posed to U.S. national security, the CIA established the China Mission Center in 2021, with the aim of better coordinating the collection and analysis components of intelligence to better inform U.S. policymakers \u2013 and most importantly, the Agency\u2019s number one customer \u2013 the president of the United States \u2013 with the most accurate information possible about Xi Jingping\u2019s intent and timeline. Cipher Brief Expert Susan Miller, who retired from the CIA just a few months ago - where she served as the Assistant Director at the Center - told <em>The Cipher Brief</em> that Xi\u2019s intent is not only to forcefully reunify Taiwan. In fact, that\u2019s just the beginning.</p><p><strong>THE INTERVIEW</strong></p><p><em>Cipher Brief CEO & Publisher Suzanne Kelly talked with Miller about how U.S. intelligence is working to better understand what Xi is thinking. Our Subscriber+ interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><div class=\"expert-block-container expert-list\">\n<div class=\"expert-item\">\n<div class=\"expert-image\">\n<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/susan-miller\">\n<img alt=\"Susan Miller, Former Assistant Director of China Mission Center, CIA\" src=\"https://assets.rbl.ms/60329984/origin.jpg\" />\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"expert-description\">\n<h4 class=\"expert-name\">\n<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/susan-miller\">Susan Miller, Former Assistant Director of China Mission Center, CIA</a>\n</h4>\n<p class=\"expert-about\">\n        Miller spent 39 years at CIA as an operations officer, serving nine tours abroad, two as a Case Officer, one as Deputy Chief of Station and six tours as Chief of Station. She also served as assistant director of several mission centers at the Agency. \n      </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong></em><em><strong>What do you think it is that the American people need to understand about why China is posing a threat to U.S. national security and how they\u2019re doing it?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>He wants to absolutely replace the U.S. as the world leader, but he doesn't want to replace us as the world leader of democracy. He wants to replace us as the world influencer. He knows that we're going to go to war someday because he absolutely plans in the coming decade, if not in the shorter term, to invade Taiwan. And he absolutely knows that we would come to the defense of democracies around the world. So, in order to give him the edge, he has - not only in America but all around the globe - been able to get into national power grids. Just think, what could you do with that capability in a time of war? You turn off the power. We know he's in power grids in America and Europe and Africa and Asia.</p><p>Why? Because companies from the People\u2019s Republic of China underbid other companies. Now that ability is gone. That's something that the previous administration and the current administration both said, \u2018<em>we're not going to let anybody get at our current infrastructure\u2019</em>. But can you imagine if we decide to go to war to support Taiwan or we have to do it because something else has happened, can you imagine having no power in California or along the Eastern seaboard? And that's why we need to really care. And Xi Jinping\u2019s plan is to take us over bit by bit. There are some things that we have kind of let go, although we shouldn't have. One of them is that he has taken over U.S. influence in Africa and other developing countries.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> </strong><strong>China has certainly used its Belt and Road Initiative to moving into these areas and they're bringing money and they're bringing infrastructure and they're making day-to-day life better for the locals \u2013 at least in the short-term.</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Yes. They're doing what we used to do with USAID and with getting U.S. companies to kind of sign up and go do this, so that we could make sure we still get important minerals and so that we can make the widgets that we need to make from all of these countries. And then we also provide a platform where a democracy can at least start and maybe not ever be as robust as ours, but at least be better than what they have now. So, that's a real concern. China is stepping into a lot of these roles all over the world. And that bothers me because that should be us doing that.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> You\u2019ve also spent a lot of your professional career focused on the threat posed by Russia. Today, when you're comparing the China threat to the Russia threat, how are these threats different?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Can you name one thing you have ever bought that says Made in China? We all can, right? Have you ever even thought about buying a toaster oven made in Russia? The answer is no. And so I'm oversimplifying this a little bit because the bottom line is that with China, we have an integrated economic goal that might help them not want to go to war with us in a way that with Russia, we have nothing.</p><p>I lived in Moscow back in the Soviet days, and my American toaster broke so I went down to a department store and bought a Russian made toaster. I plugged it in and it caught fire the first time. And it is still like that. That's why they don't manufacture stuff. There are other things that they have there. They do have some minerals and some other things. They have a pretty good agriculture system that works not only for their own people, but for that area as well. But the bottom line is that Putin does not have the same kind of leverage over us as Xi Jinping has.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> He has nuclear deterrence, but he doesn't have economic deterrence. Everyone is watching to see what happens in the negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, the war that Russia clearly did start, clearly unprovoked. And as everyone follows the slow-moving headlines on this, I'm wondering if you think Vladimir Putin, who was a former spy himself, sees the world differently than a former businessman, which Donald Trump certainly has skills in the business world. But where do you see these two things potentially colliding in terms of how the U.S. needs to be approaching negotiating with someone like Putin?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>Putin is not only a former intelligence guy from Russia. He also served as second chief directorate. And just to explain, first chief directorate spies, like CIA does, like MI6 does. You go overseas, you spot, assess, develop operations and things like that. The second chief directorate, they were the ones that put anybody who dared to say that the Soviet Union wasn't the best thing in the world into gulags. They also tortured people, dissidents, et cetera. And so he came from the nasty side of the KGB. And he's always been a believer in Russia having lost something under Yeltsin. And a guy like him - and there are a lot of them like him, just think of our version of white supremacists or white Nazi or American Nazis, things like that - that's their version. These are the people that support and work in the second chief directorate. So, that's the concern.</p><p>He doesn't care about human life. He doesn't care if his own people die in a war with Ukraine. He knows they're dying. And he knows that they're not making much progress and he's mad at his generals, but I can guarantee, in typical Russian \u2013 and I don't have absolute evidence of this because I don't have any exquisite intelligence on this - but he's probably underfunding them. They're probably not dressed well. There is still conscription going on there. And they're not that happy either. Whereas in Ukraine, they are fighting for their lives. And that, to me, is what is astounding Putin.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> The Cipher Brief has been briefed on reports from Ukrainians that captured Russian soldiers have relayed some of what they have been dealing with as are deployed to the front. A lot of them are reportedly untrained and in some cases, they reportedly didn't know who their commander was. So we know there's chaos within the ranks for sure. But we've seen something since the invasion of Ukraine that we hadn't seen on the world stage quite like this before, and that is this new friendship without any limits between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Does that concern you in a different way than these threats do on an individual basis?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>It does concern me, yes. It is concerning and it is different now that they claim they have this friendship without limits. But does any dictator really have a friend? Somebody they totally trust that they'll tell everything and vice versa? And if Xi Jinping says, \u2018<em>yes, of course I'll give you some some terrific bombs</em>,\u2019 and things like that, Xi also has to think about what kind of economic downturn is going to happen inside China if every country that sides with Ukraine - which is a lot of democracies around the world - says, \u2018<em>you know, we're going to start boycotting China\u2019</em>. That's one of the things he has to be extremely careful about.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> You stood up the China mission center for the CIA, which is something that didn\u2019t exist in this form prior. What do you think that should tell the American people about the importance of China and the importance of getting good intelligence on China?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Miller:</em> </strong>I was on my second tour in Israel when then-director [William] Burns came for a visit and during the long windy roads from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv, he mentioned that he had been talking with a China specialist at the agency and some others and said, \u2018<em>You know, I'm thinking we're not paying enough attention to China as the real strategic threat and even maybe a tactical one</em>\u2019, if you look at tactical being 10 years or less. And he said, \u2018<em>What do you think about that</em>?\u2019 I had been chief of East Asia division and chief in counter intelligence, and we had put Chinese spies behind bars. And I told him that we've been saying inside the agency for years, we are not paying enough attention to China. We were still dealing with remnants from 9/11 and Iraq and things like that, so I said, \u2018<em>I'm in\u2019</em>.</p><p>It took a while for us to figure it out and what we decided is that the China Mission Center owns property, that's going to be its own department. And so that's the China department basically, and Taiwan department at the agency. So that was one. Number two was we needed to look at the worldwide program. That's where we did the basically the external ops. And the goal was not only to work with stations - everything that we always do when we send out requirements - but we also needed to think about how we were going to do it a little bit differently so we had more success.</p><p>And so we started what we call STED, which is the Strategic Training and Education Department, which is kind of like TED talks, and they actually do a STED talk. And they're the ones that went out to every single mission center chief and built modules that really helped. So, that was the other thing that we did that was very different.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief:</strong></em><em><strong> A fascinating breakdown of how the intelligence community is prioritizing China as an intelligence target.</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em><em> </em></strong><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</strong></em></p>",

A jury previously convicted Blount in April of two counts of first-degree assault, two counts of first-degree robbery, and criminal possession of a weapon. He was acquitted of attempted murder charges.</p>\n        <p>According to prosecutors, on the night of Feb. 24, 2022, Blount approached Nina Rothschild as she was walking down the stairs to the Queens Plaza Subway station. The defendant reportedly had a black cane with him at the time and \"kicked Rothschild down the stairs, struck her on the head 13 times with a hammer, and grabbed\" her tote before fleeing.</p>\n        <p>Rothschild sustained multiple skull fractures and was transported to a hospital, where she required emergency surgery to remove parts of her skull and replace them with titanium mesh. Authorities noted that Rothschild also suffered a broken finger and other injuries.</p>\n        <p>Investigators obtained surveillance footage that reportedly revealed Blount holding the victim's bag as he walked from the subway station toward a family member's residence in Long Island City.</p>\n        <p><a href=\"https://x.com/NYPDTips/status/1498062858856415232\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Officials arrested Blount</a> on Feb. 27, 2022. The following day, police executed a search warrant at a home and found a hammer, a black cane, and Rothschild's bag. According to the district attorney's office, further testing showed that both the victim's and the defendant's DNA were on the hammer.</p>\n        <p>In a statement, Queens County District Attorney Melinda Katz said, \"I thank the survivor for testifying during this trial and bravely facing her attacker in court.&nbsp;Our transit system must be safe for everyone, and this conviction sends a strong message that those who cause mayhem on our subways will be brought to justice.\"</p>\n        <p><strong>MORE:</strong></p>\n        <ul><li><a href=\"https://queensda.org/subway-attacker-sentenced-to-25-years-to-life-in-prison-for-robbery-and-assault-conviction-in-2022-hammer-attack-on-woman-in-queens-plaza-subway-station/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Subway Attacker Sentenced to 25 Years to Life in Prison for Robbery and Assault Conviction in 2022 Hammer Attack on Woman in Queens Plaza Subway Station - Queens County District Attorney's Office</a></li><li><a href=\"https://x.com/NYPDTips/status/1498062858856415232\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">News Release, 2/27/2022 - New York Police Department Crime Stoppers</a></li></ul>",

    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/nuclear-golden-dome-missile-defense",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>More countries aspire to be nuclear-weapons states, and we should prepare for this eventuality. That\u2019s why the Golden Dome missile defense initiative is timely and needed.</p><p>The war in Ukraine is a stark reminder that Ukraine giving up their nuclear weapons, pursuant to the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, in exchange for so-called security assurances, was a grave mistake. Indeed, If Ukraine retained any portion of its 1,900 nuclear warheads, would Russia have invaded Ukraine in 2014 and 2022 and risked a nuclear confrontation? Even a revanchist Vladimir Putin would have thought twice about the consequences of a nuclear war with Ukraine.</p><p>The 1968 Treaty on the non-proliferations of nuclear weapons (NPT) has been relatively effective in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology as the then-five nuclear-weapons states \u2013 the U.S. Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom \u2013 pursued nuclear disarmament. Over the years, however, Pakistan, India and North Korea have conducted nuclear tests and are now nuclear-weapons states, with Israel not acknowledging that they have nuclear weapons. North Korea was the only country to pull out of the NPT; the others never joined.</p><p>China refuses to enter any nuclear disarmament negotiations with the U.S. and Russia, while exponentially enhancing its nuclear-weapons arsenal. Since the failed Hanoi Summit in 2019, North Korea has raced to build more nuclear weapons and ballistic missile to deliver these weapons, to include a solid fuel Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) capable of targeting the whole of the U.S.</p><p>The U.S. and Israel just bombed Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow, given that Iran was enriching uranium at 60% purity, weeks away from the 90% purity for nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) May 31 report that stated Iran was in breach of its non-proliferation obligations and was denying monitors access to suspect nuclear sites reportedly contributed to the decision to bomb these sites.</p><p>Iran just announced that they were suspending cooperation with the IAEA until the safety of its nuclear facilities could be guaranteed.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It\u2019s never been more important to understand what\u2019s happening in the world. Upgrade your access to exclusive content by </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\"><em>becoming a subscriber</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p>Over 70% of South Koreans believe they need their own nuclear weapons, despite U.S. extended deterrent commitments. There\u2019s also a sense in Japan that eventually they also will need their own nuclear weapons, as a deterrent to North Korea and possibly China. The tension in the South and East China Seas and China\u2019s attempted intimidation of Taiwan are issues that will affect both Japan and South Korea. And indeed, an emboldened North Korea, now aligned with a revanchist Russian Federation, with a mutual defense treaty and North Korean troops in Russia participating in the war of aggression in Ukraine and receiving missile, satellite and nuclear support from Russia, may strike out at South Korea, in a conflict that could escalate quickly, to include the use of tactical nuclear weapons. Other countries in East Asia may feel compelled to also seek nuclear weapons, as a deterrent to any aggressor.</p><p>The same applies to the Middle East. Iran has been clear: They will continue to enrich uranium, despite the recent bombing of their nuclear facilities. But as a threshold nuclear weapons state, weeks away from fabricating nuclear weapons, calling for the annihilation of Israel, will there be a repeat of the U.S. and Israeli bombings? Will Iran now race to acquire nuclear weapons, especially now, given the removal of IAEA monitors?</p><p>Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey are very concerned about Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. Indeed, they may also feel a need to have their own nuclear weapons arsenal, for deterrent purposes. Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan publicly spoke about the unfairness of Turkey not having nuclear weapons as a deterrent given the precarious geopolitical situation in the region.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><em>Sign up today</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p>Our missile defense capabilities have lagged behind the advances in nuclear-weapons technology, especially the lethality of today\u2019s nuclear weapons that are eighty times more powerful than the atomic bombs used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p><p>There are currently over 13,000 nuclear weapons in the global stockpile of nuclear weapons, down from over 60,000 nuclear weapons during the Cold War. The New START arms control treaty between the U.S. and the Russian Federation, responsible for this reduction in nuclear weapons, expires on February 5, 2026, and Russia has refused to engage substantively on a successor to New START. So, what follows is uncertainty.</p><p>What is certain is that China will continue to build more nuclear weapons, with Beijing estimated to have over 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030; and North Korea, currently estimated to have over 50 nuclear warheads, is determined to build more nuclear weapons; and Iran is determined to remain a threshold nuclear-weapons state, weeks away from having nuclear weapons.</p><p>If South Korea and Japan and others in East Asia and if Saudi Arabia and Turkey and others in the Middle East decide to go nuclear, the global stockpile of nuclear weapons will increase exponentially. We also know that terrorist organizations, like Al-Qaeda, previously attempted to buy a nuclear weapon or radiological materials for a dirty bomb. And there may be countries willing to sell these weapons and radiological materials, or unable to securely store these weapons and materials that, then, are acquired by a rogue state or terrorist organization.</p><p>These are just some of the reasons why a Golden Dome <sub></sub>missile defense system is needed. Deploying space-based sensors and interceptors is no longer the Star Wars (Strategic Defense Initiative) that President Reagan pursued in 1983. We now have the technology and a budget of $175 billion to establish a viable missile defense capability hopefully within three years. We owe the American people security from the threat of a bad actor using nuclear weapons to attack the U.S.</p><p><em><strong>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/9/golden-dome-missile-defense-essential-americas-survival/\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Times</a></strong></em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong></strong></p><p><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business</strong></em><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>",

Most of the groups operate as crisis pregnancy centers, or pregnancy resource centers, which often resemble medical clinics but are frequently criticized for offering little or no actual health care and misleading women about their options.</p>\n\n<p>In its 20 years of existence, the program\u2019s funding has grown fortyfold \u2014 reaching $100 million a year starting Sept. 1 \u2014 making it the most heavily funded effort of its kind in the country.</p>\n\n<p>Under new rules set to take effect then, the organizations in the program must now document all of their expenses, and they will be reimbursed only for costs tied to services approved by the state. And they cannot seek reimbursement when they redistribute donated items, an effort to prevent taxpayer money from going to organizations for goods they got for free.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Texas is opening administration of the program to a <a href=\"https://resources.hhs.texas.gov/rfa/hhs0015167\">competitive selection process</a> instead of automatically renewing agreements with contractors, including one contractor that has overseen most of the program for nearly two decades.</p>\n\n<p>The changes address failures uncovered a year ago by the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-funding-anti-abortion-crisis-pregnancy-centers\">ProPublica/CBS News investigation</a>. As Thriving Texas Families currently operates, most providers are paid a flat rate for each service they claim to provide, regardless of the actual cost of that service. As a result, a single client visit can generate multiple stacked charges, significantly increasing the amount of public money being spent. In some cases, providers billed separately for each item or service given to a client \u2014 such as diapers, baby clothes, blankets, wipes, snacks and even educational pamphlets \u2014 according to records reviewed by ProPublica and CBS News.</p>\n\n<p>That arrangement allowed organizations to bill the state for more than the services actually cost to provide \u2014 and keep the difference. One group, Sealy Pregnancy Resource Center, more than quintupled its assets in three years by banking some reimbursements. Its executive director, Patricia Penner, acknowledged the practice, saying her goal was \u201cto make sure we have enough for this center to continue and to continue for the years to come.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee the funds we receive is going to be sufficient to keep the center going,\u201d Penner added, \u201cand it\u2019s my duty as a director to ensure we are taking whatever service funds we are receiving to ensure we can take care of these young ladies when they come in the door.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Two others, McAllen Pregnancy Center and Pregnancy Center of the Coastal Bend in Corpus Christi, used reimbursements to finance real estate deals. The McAllen center, which receives nearly all its revenue from the state, <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2022/11/04/texas-abortion-clinic-pregnancy-crisis-center/\">bought a building</a> that had previously housed an abortion clinic. The Coastal Bend center <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/31/pregnancy-center-of-the-coastal-bend-expansion/\">openly acknowledged using state funds</a> to buy land for a new facility. The centers did not respond to questions.</p>\n\n<p>In San Antonio, Thriving Texas Families cut off funding to a pregnancy center known as A New Life for a New Generation after a local news outlet reported it had <a href=\"https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2022/03/14/after-defenders-investigation-san-antonio-nonprofit-shuts-down-east-side-location/\">spent taxpayer money on vacations</a>, on a motorcycle and to fund a smoke shop business owned by its president and CEO. The center did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>ProPublica and CBS News also found that state health officials had no visibility into what services were being delivered or whether they were reaching the people most in need. In many cases, the state reimbursed providers $14 each time they handed out donated goods or materials, regardless of their cost or how they got them.</p>\n\n<p>That included distributing pamphlets on parenting, fetal development and adoption, which could trigger the same reimbursement as providing tangible aid like diapers or formula. The state could not say exactly how much it had spent on these materials because it did not track what was being distributed.</p>\n\n<p>State-approved pamphlets and lessons reviewed by a reporter stated inaccuracies \u2014 such as that a fetal heartbeat starts 21 days after conception \u2014 and painted single motherhood as risky and lonely, with marriage or adoption as better options.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>While flat-rate reimbursement is sometimes used in government contracting, nonprofit and accounting experts said applying it to the distribution of donated goods \u2014 without clear standards for quantity or value \u2014 was highly irregular.</p>\n\n<p>Officials with the state Health and Human Services Commission, which oversees Thriving Texas Families, did not say what prompted the policy shift, only that it was following guidance from the state comptroller. That guidance recommends awarding state grants as reimbursements for actual expenses.</p>\n\n<p>The state has long allowed its main contractor, Texas Pregnancy Care Network, to handle most of the program\u2019s oversight. The network told the news organizations last year that once state funds were passed to subcontractors, \u201cit is no longer taxpayer money\u201d and those groups were free to spend it as they saw fit. HHSC pushed back against the network, saying it still considered the money to be taxpayer dollars and expected it to be used in line with state guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>The shift to a cost-reimbursement model appears to bring the program more in line with how public money is typically distributed across state agencies in Texas.</p>\n\n<p>Texas Pregnancy Care Network, which in recent years has received nearly 75% of the Thriving Texas Families funding and distributed it to dozens of crisis pregnancy centers, faith-based groups and other charities that serve as subcontractors, did not respond to questions about how it plans to approach the new contract or adapt to the stricter reimbursement rules.</p>\n\n<p>State Rep. Donna Howard, a Democrat from Austin and a vocal critic of the state\u2019s support for anti-abortion programs, said in an interview that while she opposes taxpayer support for anti-abortion programs, she sees the new rules as a step in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p>But with the new reimbursement requirements in place, Howard questioned whether many of the centers would even be able to make use of the funding. Unlike the previous flat-fee system, providers must now track costs, document services and submit receipts to justify their spending. \u201cWho knows if they can actually use the funds now that they have to show receipts,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>By requiring pregnancy centers to track clients\u2019 income, education level and employment \u2014 and to provide clients with information about public benefits available to them \u2014 the state is moving away from a system that allowed nonprofits to collect funds without regard for who was receiving help.</p>\n\n<p>Pregnancy resource centers and anti-abortion activists lobbied Republican lawmakers to block the policy change during the most recent legislative session, and some publicly denounced it.</p>\n\n<p>On the social media platform X, Rep. Jeff Leach, a Republican from the northern Dallas suburbs, urged the agency to \u201cnot give veto power\u201d over the program \u201cto biased media reporters.\u201d Leach did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>In an interview, Texas Right to Life President John Seago warned that the new reimbursement model would discourage participation. He said it was \u201cnot worth small providers getting into the program because of all the red tape.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And in written testimony, Penner, from Sealy, implored legislators to <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/publiccomments/billhistory/SB01388H.pdf\">preserve the current model</a>, saying it allowed her team \u201cto focus on serving our clients rather than staffing up in order to handle the paperwork\u201d required for reimbursement.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the pushback, lawmakers did not take action to block the new rules.</p>\n\n<p>Ge Bai, a professor of accounting and health policy at Johns Hopkins University, said switching to a cost-reimbursement system could help prevent waste by making sure organizations only get paid for what they actually spend.</p>\n\n<p>But she warned that this model has its own risks. Since providers know they will be reimbursed, they might not be as careful about keeping costs down \u2014 or could even inflate their expenses to get more money. She pointed to Medicare, which used a similar system in the past but abandoned it after costs spiraled out of control.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid the same problem, she said, the program will need strong public oversight to make sure organizations aren\u2019t overspending just because they know the state will cover the bill.</p>\n\n<p>One reproductive health policy specialist who has closely tracked Texas\u2019 spending on crisis pregnancy centers cautioned that the reforms do little to address the broader gaps in the state\u2019s social safety net.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really make up for a lack of Medicaid health insurance for the very poor in Texas by giving people educational services, pamphlets and diapers,\u201d said Laura Dixon, a researcher with Resound Research for Reproductive Health, based in Austin.</p>\n\n<p>But at the very least, she said, \u201cunderstanding where money is going is a really good first step for this program.\u201d</p>",

Then, colliding with another soggy system sliding north off the Pacific, the storm wobbled and its clouds tipped, waterboarding south central Texas with an extraordinary 20 inches of rain. In the predawn blackness, the Guadalupe River, which drains from the Hill Country, rose by more than 26 vertical feet in just 45 minutes, jumping its banks and hurtling downstream, killing 109 people, including at least 27 children at a summer camp located inside a federally designated floodway.</p>\n\n<p>Over the days and weeks to come there will be tireless \u2014 and warranted \u2014 analysis of who is to blame for this heart-wrenching loss. Should Kerr County, where most of the deaths occurred, have installed warning sirens along that stretch of the waterway, and why were children allowed to sleep in an area prone to high-velocity flash flooding? Why were urgent updates apparently only conveyed by cellphone and online in a rural area with limited connectivity? Did the National Weather Service, enduring steep budget cuts under the current administration, adequately forecast this storm?</p>\n\n<p>Those questions are critical. But so is a far larger concern: The rapid onset of disruptive climate change \u2014 driven by the burning of oil, gasoline and coal \u2014 is making disasters like this one more common, more deadly and far more costly to Americans, even as the federal government is running away from the policies and research that might begin to address it.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>President <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/3227654/PSAC-1965-Restoring-the-Quality-of-Our-Environment.pdf\">Lyndon B. Johnson was briefed</a> in 1965 that a climate crisis was being caused by burning fossil fuels and was warned that it would create the conditions for intensifying storms and extreme events, and this country \u2014 including 10 more presidents \u2014 has debated how to respond to that warning ever since. Still, it took decades for the slow-motion change to grow large enough to affect people\u2019s everyday lives and safety and for the world to reach the stage it is in now: an age of climate-driven chaos, where the past is no longer prologue and the specific challenges of the future might be foreseeable but are less predictable. </p>\n\n<p>Climate change doesn\u2019t chart a linear path where each day is warmer than the last. Rather, science suggests that we\u2019re now in an age of discontinuity, with heat one day and hail the next and with more dramatic extremes. Across the planet, dry places are getting drier while wet places are getting wetter. The jet stream \u2014 the band of air that circulates through the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 is slowing to a near stall at times, weaving off its tracks, causing unprecedented events like polar vortexes drawing arctic air far south. Meanwhile the heat is sucking moisture from the drought-plagued plains of Kansas only to dump it over Spain, contributing to last year\u2019s cataclysmic floods.</p>\n\n<p>We saw something similar when Hurricane Harvey dumped as much as 60 inches of rain on parts of Texas in 2017 and when Hurricane Helene devastated North Carolina last year \u2014 and countless times in between. We witnessed it again in Texas this past weekend. Warmer oceans evaporate faster, and warmer air holds more water, transporting it in the form of humidity across the atmosphere, until it can\u2019t hold it any longer and it falls. Meteorologists estimate that the atmosphere had reached its capacity for moisture before the storm struck.</p>\n\n<p>The disaster comes during a week in which extreme heat and extreme weather have battered the planet. Parts of northern Spain and southern France are burning out of control, as are parts of California. In the past 72 hours, storms have torn the roofs off of five-story apartment buildings in Slovakia, while intense rainfall has turned streets into rivers in southern Italy. Same story in Lombok, Indonesia, where cars floated like buoys, and in eastern China, where an inland typhoon-like storm sent furniture blowing down the streets like so many sheafs of paper. L\u00e9on, Mexico, was battered by hail so thick on Monday it covered the city in white. And North Carolina is, again, enduring 10 inches of rainfall.</p>\n\n<p>There is no longer much debate that climate change is making many of these events demonstrably worse. Scientists conducting a rapid analysis of last week\u2019s extreme heat wave that spread across Europe have concluded that human-caused warming killed roughly 1,500 more people than might have otherwise perished. Early reports suggest that the flooding in Texas, too, was substantially influenced by climate change. According to <a href=\"https://www.climameter.org/20250704-texas-floods?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-84B4b5mdW3DXc8sB902N4jq-09-zJ9MvQW8nFsRUtJduhbaznp2w8RKVqS6AfdZDSSs5BtWMnzIHk7pQGWl-YMY5AvAmT5Nd0UsdcQ4Wl7nDvcDQ4&amp;_hsmi=112926468&amp;utm_content=112926468&amp;utm_source=hs_email\">a preliminary analysis</a> by ClimaMeter, a joint project of the European Union and the French National Centre for Scientific Research, the weather in Texas was 7% wetter on July 4 than it was before climate change warmed that part of the state, and natural variability alone cannot explain \u201cthis very exceptional meteorological condition.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That the United States once again is reeling from familiar but alarming headlines and body counts should not be a surprise by now. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the number of extreme weather disasters has jumped fivefold worldwide over the past 50 years, and the number of deaths has nearly tripled. In the United States, which prefers to measure its losses in dollars, the damage from major storms was more than $180 billion last year, nearly 10 times the average annual toll during the 1980s, after accounting for inflation. These storms have now cost Americans nearly $3 trillion. Meanwhile, the number of annual major disasters has grown sevenfold. Fatalities in billion-dollar storms last year alone were nearly equal to the number of such deaths counted by the federal government in the 20 years between 1980 and 2000.</p>\n\n<p>The most worrisome fact, though, may be that the warming of the planet has scarcely begun. Just as each step up on the Richter scale represents a massive increase in the force of an earthquake, the damage caused by the next 1 or 2 degrees Celsius of warming stands to be far greater than that caused by the 1.5 degrees we have so far endured. The world\u2019s leading scientists, the United Nations panel on climate change and even many global energy experts warn that we face something akin to our last chance before it is too late to curtail a runaway crisis. It\u2019s one reason our predictions and modeling capabilities are becoming an essential, lifesaving mechanism of national defense.</p>\n\n<p>What is extraordinary is that at such a volatile moment, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration would choose not just to minimize the climate danger \u2014 and thus the suffering of the people affected by it \u2014 but to revoke funding for the very data collection and research that would help the country better understand and prepare for this moment.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past couple of months, the administration has <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-noaa-budget-cuts-climate-change-modeling-princeton-gfdl\">defunded much of the operations of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, the nation\u2019s chief climate and scientific agency responsible for weather forecasting, as well as the cutting-edge earth systems research at places like Princeton University, which is essential to modeling an aberrant future. It has canceled the nation\u2019s seminal scientific assessment of climate change and risk. The administration has defunded the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s core program paying for infrastructure projects meant to prevent major disasters from causing harm, and it has threatened to eliminate FEMA itself, the main federal agency charged with helping Americans after a climate emergency like the Texas floods. It has \u2014 as of last week \u2014 signed legislation that unravels the federal programs meant to slow warming by helping the country\u2019s industries transition to cleaner energy. And it has even stopped the reporting of the cost of disasters, stating that doing so is \u201cin alignment with evolving priorities\u201d of the administration. It is as if the administration hopes that making the price tag for the Kerr County flooding invisible would make the events unfolding there seem less devastating.</p>\n\n<p>Given the abandonment of policy that might forestall more severe events like the Texas floods by reducing the emissions that cause them, Americans are left to the daunting task of adapting. In Texas, it is critical to ask whether the protocols in place at the time of the storm were good enough. This week is not the first time that children have died in a flash flood along the Guadalupe River, and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/officials-pushed-for-better-warning-system-years-before-devastating-texas-floods-0143b5f1?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAg8PDihhju1lXQFVwJ73c4mJ5pL-YE_DmjCsUN5l-VW-vekKsrhZQswe00fUyE%3D&amp;gaa_ts=686d3ab1&amp;gaa_sig=prM9v_8AJkqqP4diI96LSicw4bJ5xX8tS8MkM0Jk8HKRh383rMddafuvlj68c62bueT4VkLOjBpNC_KoVRqPrg%3D%3D\">reports suggest</a> county officials struggled to raise money and then declined to install a warning system in 2018 in order to save approximately $1 million. But the country faces a larger and more daunting challenge, because this disaster \u2014 like the firestorms in Los Angeles and the hurricanes repeatedly pummeling Florida and the southeast \u2014 once again raises the question of where people can continue to safely live. It might be that in an era of what researchers are calling \u201cmega rain\u201d events, a flood plain should now be off-limits.</p>",

For her troubles, she received a one-time payment of $770 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which she used to replace clothes, food and a crate for her dog. While it was only a fraction of what she needed, the money was at least available while she waited for other funding.</p>\n\n<p>As an organizer with the Altadena Tenants Union who has been helping renters with their FEMA applications, Clark knows just how common her experience has been for fire survivors. She believes federal and local agencies <a href=\"https://chu.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/chu.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/final-letter-to-fema-regarding-federal-housing-programs-for-los-angeles-fire-survivors.pdf\">severely underestimated</a> the need and cost of housing for the 150,000 people displaced by the fires, leaving many still struggling to recover. A FEMA spokesperson denied the accusation, saying the agency\u2019s \u201congoing assessments indicate that the current Rental Assistance program is effectively meeting the housing needs of survivors eligible for FEMA assistance.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The disaster response \u201chas been so shockingly bad,\u201d Clark said, but she recognizes that without FEMA\u2019s help in responding to fires that killed at least <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/death-toll-from-the-wildfires-that-tore-through-the-los-angeles-area-reaches-30/\">30 people</a> and destroyed more than <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/la-wildfires-aftermath-insurance-housing-rebuild-update/story?id=119209482\">16,000 structures</a>, \u201cit could have been so, so, so much worse.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe would have seen a whole lot more people left to their own devices. And what that would mean is homelessness. It would mean people just abandoned,\u201d Clark said.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Even before President Donald Trump and Gov. Gavin Newsom squared off over Trump\u2019s decision to send National Guard troops to quell immigration protests, before Newsom likened Trump to a dictator and Trump endorsed the idea of arresting the governor, the question of how much California could continue to rely on FEMA was front and center.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s a critical question in a state \u2014 with its earthquakes, wildfires, floods, drought and extreme heat \u2014 that frequently suffers <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/mapping\">some of the costliest disasters</a> in the country.</p>\n\n<p>Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, his administration has floated sweeping proposals that would slash FEMA dollars and make disasters harder to declare. This has left both blue and red states wrestling with scenarios in which they must pay for what FEMA will not. States have long counted on FEMA to cover at least 75% of declared major disaster response and recovery costs.</p>\n\n<p>In just the past few months, FEMA has denied federal assistance for devastating <a href=\"https://westvirginiawatch.com/2025/04/29/femas-refusal-to-help-some-west-virginia-counties-just-a-taste-of-whats-to-come/\">floods in West Virginia</a> and a destructive <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/04/14/trump-s-fema-denies-washington-disaster-relief-for-bomb-cyclone-windstorm/\">windstorm in Washington</a>. The agency approved such funding for deadly tornadoes in Arkansas after Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appealed an initial denial and <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/sarah-sanders-begs-her-old-150513581.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANHkWGyIK7o9Y3LWrcxxb6F2T-vnrsTIgYBEbrPQ_V3HFmbM4_7LCx4KhiFlLWI1Jq_W1nZ_Wna8RiCw6VPiyV_Khsb2FzJCCSphNAilh4BVev2ewwIlzPakKwNVMF8_zilLuXw1fn7cDf5viYCCG2ZertlViMekUGyJOS75GLNF\">personally begged</a> the president for help.</p>\n\n<p>Last month, ProPublica reported that <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/fema-grants-trump-emergencies\">FEMA missed a May deadline</a> to open the application process for many grants, including funding that states rely on to pay for basic emergency management operations. The delay, which the agency has not explained, appears to have little precedent.</p>\n\n<p>In California, Trump has cast doubt on whether he will approve the $40 billion Newsom <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-wildfires-newsom-federal-aid-71ec591a60c05d45432382095dbfd147\">has requested</a> to help pay for recovery costs associated with the fires, including $16.8 billion from FEMA to rebuild property, infrastructure and remove debris. That\u2019s on top of the almost $140 million the agency has already provided to individual survivors.</p>\n\n<p>The president told reporters last month that states need to be weaned off FEMA and that the federal government will start distributing less federal aid after hurricane season ends in November.</p>\n\n<p>The questions now are: How much will be approved? Will it be enough? And, if not, what then?</p>\n\n<p>A FEMA spokesperson did not directly respond to questions from Capital &amp; Main about anticipated funding cuts and potential impacts on state and local communities, but said the agency \u201casserts that disasters are best managed when they\u2019re federally supported, state managed and locally executed.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The uncertainty makes it \u201cvery hard\u201d to plan, said Heather Gonzalez, principal fiscal and policy analyst for emergency services at California\u2019s Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. \u201cThe little bean-counters in the back are stressing out right now trying to figure out \u2018what are we going to have to work with?\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The recent \u201cdust-ups\u201d between Newsom and Trump, she said, have only underscored the unpredictability. For his part, Newsom said he prefers the \u201copen hand\u201d of cooperation over the \u201cclosed fist\u201d of fighting when it comes to disaster response.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEmergency preparedness and emergency planning, recovery and renewal \u2014 period, full stop \u2014 that should be nonpolitical,\u201d he said on Monday, which marked six months since the fires.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            A firefighter battles a blaze in Altadena during the Eaton Fire.\n    \n            (Jeremy Lindenfeld/Capital &amp;amp; Main)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \nThe Rising Cost of Disasters\n<p>Since at least the 1980s, California has endured a rapidly growing number of billion-dollar disasters, with <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/state-summary/CA#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20California%20has%20experienced,billion%20%2D%20a%20new%20U.S.%20record\">18 occurring</a> between 2015 and 2024 alone.</p>\n\n<p>As the frequency and severity of California\u2019s disasters increase, so too does its reliance on federal assistance to respond. In the aftermath of January\u2019s Eaton and Palisades fires \u2014 <a href=\"https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top20_destruction_061925.pdf?rev=44aa48ce19614b759d44cf02380f34a5&amp;hash=59939EF7BE88548E2E8B4D718F060531\">the second and third most destructive wildfires</a> in California history, respectively \u2014 FEMA has already provided $139 million for everything from home repair costs to medical expenses, and the agency \u201chas allocated billions of dollars for debris removal,\u201d according to a FEMA spokesperson. <a href=\"https://news.caloes.ca.gov/more-than-5000-properties-complete-in-wildfire-debris-removal-effort/\">Over 5,000 properties</a> have already been cleared of ash and fire debris.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            The ruins of a bank that was destroyed in the Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades. The wildfire was the third most destructive in California history.\n    \n            (Sarahbeth Maney/ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management Communications Director Emily Montanez said recovery efforts for the fires likely won\u2019t be complete for many years and are heavily dependent on FEMA.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAfter the Northridge earthquake in 1994, FEMA had field offices here for 28 years,\u201d Montanez said. \u201cWe see this as being no different. This was way more devastation, way more impact. So this could be years, definitely decades.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>While Montanez acknowledged that potential \u201cgaps\u201d in disaster response efforts leave some survivors without sufficient resources, she said that the recent operations coordinated between FEMA and local agencies in Los Angeles have mostly been efficient and successful.</p>\n\n<p>FEMA\u2019s federal assistance supplements California\u2019s own disaster response and mitigation resources like those allocated to the <a href=\"https://www.caloes.ca.gov/\">Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services</a>, which was allotted $4.4 billion in the May revision of the <a href=\"https://ebudget.ca.gov/FullBudgetSummary.pdf\">state\u2019s 2025-26 budget</a>. When the office\u2019s funding does not cover all disaster costs, California can also pull from a number of its reserves, including the Budget Stabilization Account and Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties.</p>\n\n<p>Newsom told Capital &amp; Main on Monday that the state has increased its discretionary reserves as a direct consequence of Trump\u2019s ongoing threats to FEMA, though he admitted that even that increased investment wouldn\u2019t make up for the potential loss in federal funding. </p>\n\n<p>California \u201ccan\u2019t backfill the elimination of FEMA,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThere\u2019s no state in America [that can], even the most endowed state \u2014 $4.1 trillion a year economy \u2014 largest in the nation, fourth largest in the world.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>And California\u2019s <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/05/california-budget-revision-may-2025/\">$12 billion budget deficit</a> will make backfilling the office\u2019s shortfall especially difficult the next time a major disaster strikes, according to Laurie Schoeman, senior adviser on climate resilience to former President Joe Biden.</p>\n\n<p>That will be made even harder if the still-unfinalized proposals outlined in <a href=\"https://lisamillerassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FEMA-OMB_Memo_FEMA_Rebalance_250423.pdf\">an internal FEMA memo</a> are implemented, according to Schoeman. One of the reforms floated in the memo caps the proportion of recovery costs covered by the federal government at the current baseline of 75%. Under current rules, the president can increase FEMA\u2019s cost share up to 100%, as <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/01/09/californias-partnership-with-federal-government-boosts-states-rapid-response-to-los-angeles-fires/\">Biden did</a> for the Los Angeles fires less than two weeks before he left office.</p>\n\n<p>Another proposal quadruples the amount of damage that needs to be suffered in a disaster before FEMA awards any public assistance grants for infrastructure repair and debris removal. That would hike California\u2019s damage threshold from roughly $75 million to nearly $300 million per disaster.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>Had just that second reform been in place between 2008 and 2024, California would have received 26% less in public assistance funding from FEMA, a loss of nearly $2 billion, according to <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/proposed-cuts-federal-disaster-assistance-will-hit-states-just-hurricane-season-ramps#:~:text=Last%20week%2C%20CNN%20reported%20that,the%20same%2016%2Dyear%20period.\">a May analysis</a> by the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.</p>\n\n<p>Such reduced funding during future events would cause an \u201capocalyptic scenario\u201d where California communities would struggle to afford the cost of running shelters and paying for emergency responders to rescue disaster victims, according to Sarah Labowitz, a senior fellow in the Sustainability, Climate, and Geopolitics Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p>\n\n<p>Yet already, significant damage has been done, Schoeman said.</p>\n\n<p>In April, the Trump administration canceled the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, a FEMA initiative dedicated to funding disaster-preparedness projects. Over $880 million in federal funding was rescinded, including a $35 million grant in California\u2019s Napa County largely dedicated to wildfire prevention work. The administration declined to respond to Capital &amp; Main\u2019s request for comment, referring questions to FEMA. An agency spokesperson said that its approach to disaster preparedness mirrors that of disaster response: FEMA will play a supporting role.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAll types of preparedness start with families, individuals and local and state officials ahead of any emergency and disaster,\u201d a statement from the agency said.</p>\n\n<p>The rescinded federal funding risks undermining communities\u2019 abilities to protect against future disasters, Schoeman said, and undoes work accomplished under Trump\u2019s first term.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re just cutting these projects even though they have proven benefit cost analyses in place,\u201d Schoeman said. \u201cThe BRIC program was started under the Trump administration \u2026 so it feels like the administration is going to cut their own leg off.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Smoke drifts over Will Rogers State Beach and the Pacific Ocean during the Palisades Fire.\n    \n            (Jeremy Lindenfeld/Capital &amp;amp; Main)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Clark said she is already struggling to get help. She said her insurance provider has so far withheld over $25,000 due to disagreements over whether her transitional housing qualifies as temporary, and her applications for additional FEMA assistance have been denied due to her technically being insured. Some wealthier survivors had \u201cthe insulation and resiliency that economic resources give you,\u201d while others had to depend on nonprofits or the kind of government assistance that is now at risk to afford transitional housing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have those economic resources, your only option is to turn to either philanthropy or the state,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIf neither of those are available, then tough luck.\u201d</p>",

If my living room was filled with judgmental spirits, it felt disrespectful to remain such a mess</p><p>About a year after I moved into my apartment in Los Angeles, I was woken up by three loud knocks on my bedroom door at 3am. I thought there might be an intruder \u2013 but I got up, opened the door, and there was nobody there. I went to the front door, thinking I had misheard it, but there was nobody there either. I thought I had imagined it. Then it kept happening about once a week.</p><p>I thought it must be my upstairs neighbours, perhaps working a night shift, but after I introduced myself to them to ask about the noise, they assured me they wouldn\u2019t be awake at that hour. I asked the man who looks after our 70s-built apartment block if there were problems with the pipes. He said no. At one point, I started putting my dresser in front of the door, because I was so scared. I couldn\u2019t shake the idea that somebody was getting into my apartment, even though there was no evidence of it. I didn\u2019t tell anyone for ages \u2013 because if I had, I would have had to recognise how crazy I sounded.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/09/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-was-told-my-home-was-haunted-it-made-me-tidier-happier\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "description": "<p><strong>FINE PRINT / OPINION \u2014 </strong>\u201cThis report explores the environmental effects and societal and economic consequences that would be expected to follow in the weeks-to-decades after a nuclear war. The exploration begins\u2026with the consideration of four plausible scenarios for the employment of nuclear weapons, along with description of the immediate effects of the energy release and blast from a nuclear detonation.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s an excerpt from Chapter 2 of a new congressionally-mandated study from the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) entitled, <em><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/independent-study-on-potential-environmental-effects-of-nuclear-war\" target=\"_blank\">Potential Environmental Effects of Nuclear War</a></em></em>, that was released online June 25.</p><p>Because I have written extensively about nuclear weapons, including in my 2021 book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/403ad3K\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Blown To Hell</em>,</a> which is about radioactive fallout on the Marshall Islanders from the Bikini thermonuclear Bravo test in 1954, I was surprised to read <span style=\"background-color: initial;\">that \u201cevaluation of radioactive fallout was not included in the scope of the work.\u201d That apparently was because so much had already been published about the impact of radiation and radioactivity from nuclear weapons.</span></p><p>This new NAS study focuses primarily on the release of thermal energy (heat) from a nuclear explosion in the lower atmosphere, as well as kinetic energy (blast) and the air shockwave caused by the latter. A nuclear detonation in the atmosphere, where the fireball does not hit the ground, releases some 35 percent of its energy in heat; another 50 percent in blast and shock wave, and the remaining 15 percent of energy in radiation.</p><p>Nonetheless, I believe the study is worth exploring, if only, for example, to see the \u201cfour plausible scenarios\u201d the expert writers see that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. In addition, studies such as these often disclose facts not normally available.</p><p>There were a series of scientific studies in the 1980s that raised concern about large-scale nuclear exchanges leading to \u201cnuclear winter\u201d scenarios. They showed that nearly every country in the world would be affected, beyond those in conflict. In those studies, nuclear use by superpowers caused immense firestorms whose light-blocking soot and particulates reduced sunlight to disrupt worldwide agriculture and ecosystems for years.</p><p>I believe reminders such as that make all such studies valuable, because they can reduce the likelihood of any nuclear weapon use. The authors of this new study apparently feel that way since they wrote, \u201cWith growing risks of nuclear proliferation and evolving warfare doctrines, this renewed scientific examination aims to quantify the grave global stakes should such hostilities occur in the current and future security environments.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Sign up for the </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Cyber Initiatives Group</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

They are the United Kingdom with an estimated 225 weapons; France with 290; India with 160; Pakistan with 170; China with 500 and growing; and North Korea with 50.</p><p>I must point out here that the NAS has omitted Israel, which has some 90 or more nuclear weapons, according to experts such as Hans Kristensen and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The U.S. Government and apparently the NAS follow Israeli policy of ambiguity, neither confirming nor denying their nuclear weapons exist, although they have had them since the late-1960s. Israel even has sub-launched, nuclear-tipped cruise missiles as well as nuclear bombs and land-based missiles.</p><p>In its study, the NAS presents what it describes as four plausible scenarios for nuclear weapon use:</p><p>Large-scale strategic usage of 2,000 warheads, where the scenario is that the Russia/U.S. nuclear exchanges begin at the tactical level, but escalate to the strategic level;</p><p>Moderate-scale strategic exchange of 400 warheads, where the scenario is a China/U.S. conflict;</p><p>Small-scale regional conflict of 150 warheads, such as one between Pakistan and India;</p><p>Very small-scale use of a single warhead, to \u201cdemonstrate resolve\u201d and \u201ca willingness to employ nuclear weapons.\u201d This scenario seems to follow the Russian strategy of \u201cescalate to de-escalate,\u201d that initially appeared in the past decade.</p><p>The NAS study says it has proposed these scenarios in order \u201cto study potential environmental inputs,\u201d though the study also \u201crecommends further development of a more comprehensive set of scenarios.\u201d</p><p>I should point out that I have been told that in U.S. military wargaming, when the scenario leads to one side using a nuclear weapon and escalation begins, the game usually ends because no one is prepared to say where nuclear exchanges are going or how to stop them.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

But the study notes that \u201cwhile some military targets are likely in or near urban areas, present-day [nuclear] weapons are generally more accurate and are of lower yields, which would likely reduce the impact on civilian structures.\u201d</p><p>Hiroshima, the Japanese target for the first U.S. atomic bomb, was described in a 1945 pre-attack U.S. government document put together by Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s Target Committee as \u201can important depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged.\u201d</p><p>The point was then, and I believe it remains now, that any decision to use a nuclear weapon is in recognition that its use would destroy property and kill many people, both military and civilian. Remember, some 70,000 people were killed at Hiroshima with thousands more dying later from effects of that one atomic bomb.</p><p>The NAS study points out, \u201cFollowing a nuclear blast [totaling one megaton], there are two surface-temperature pulses and two pulses of thermal radiation from the fireball.\u201d The first thermal pulse lasts just one-tenth of a second but is \u201ccapable of permanent or temporary effects on the eyes.\u201d</p><p>The second thermal pulse may last up to ten seconds and \u201ccarries about 99 percent of total thermal radiation energy\u2026 This radiation is the main cause of skin burns up to 12 miles or more away, and of eye effects at even greater distance. The radiation from the second pulse can also cause fires to start under suitable conditions.\u201d There was a firestorm at Hiroshima.</p><p>When it comes to the blast effect from nuclear weapons, the NAS study says, \u201cMost thermal radiation reaches material in advance of the blast wave,\u201d something that is not generally understood. The study adds, \u201cThe blast can extinguish flames, but can also leave smoldering material and rubble which can grow into larger fires. Blast waves can cause damage that results in secondary ignitions, thus being an additional source of fire starts.\u201d</p><p>Within the city limits of Hiroshima, 92 percent of all buildings were destroyed or damaged. Of that number, 63 percent were completely destroyed by fire, with only 5 percent completely destroyed only by blast.</p><p>The NAS study describes agriculture and food production as among the economic consequences of nuclear weapon usage, saying there \u201ccan be extensive direct and indirect impacts\u2026with far-reaching consequences for immediate and long-term food security.\u201d</p><p>In one of several radiation mentions, the NAS study says, \u201cRadioactive fallout, pollution, and habitat destruction could contribute to the decline of various plant and animal species, disrupting ecosystem services crucial for maintaining soil fertility, pest control and ecosystem health. This could further challenge agricultural systems to recover and adapt to the new post-war conditions.\u201d</p><p>I saw first-hand in the Marshall Islands in the 1970s that decades after being subjected to radioactive fallout from a powerful thermonuclear weapon ground-burst more than 100 miles away, plants grown on land and shellfish from the sea still showed radioactivity that made them dangerous to eat.</p><p>There is a footnote in the NAS study scenarios section that mentions so-called countervalue nuclear targets, which it describes as \u201ccivilian and cultural targets, population centers and infrastructure.\u201d In other words, they are urban or suburban civilian-populated areas.</p><p>That footnote adds: \u201cIn some sense, countervalue targets can be understood to be punitive or for revenge; however, these terms are currently considered out-dated and inappropriate with current U.S. nuclear strategy.\u201d</p><p>As I noted earlier, Oppenheimer and his Target Committee saw their massively powerful atomic bombs as devices to end a war, not fight one. In my terms, in 1945 they understood that their new nuclear bombs were terror weapons, designed to show how many buildings could be destroyed and people killed with a single bomb.</p><p>And I believe now, however one talks about nuclear weapons and no matter the number they have, they remain today terror weapons \u2014 and that is what deters their use today \u2013 at least against a nation that has its own nuclear weapons or is allied with such a nation.</p><p><em><strong><em>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

A growing sense of urgency is quietly emerging.</p><p>China\u2019s preparation for a potential invasion is no longer a distant possibility but a reality rapidly coming into focus \u2014and defense planners are grappling with a pressing question: how and when will Washington act?</p><p>\u201cTaiwan is incredibly reliant upon U.S. support for both deterrence against China, as well as a war-fighting invasion scenario,\u201d Kitsch Liao, associate director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global China Hub, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThe U.S. is the sole arms supplier for Taiwan because China has coerced every other country into not selling Taiwan any weapons.\u201d</p><p>Taiwan, a democratic and technologically vital island of 24 million people, faces increasing military, economic, and political pressure from Beijing.

Taiwan\u2019s TSMC <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-makes-the-majority-of-the-worlds-computer-chips-now-its-running-out-of-electricity/#:~:text=Along%20the%20way%2C%20Hsinchu%20Science,world's%20most%20advanced%20computer%20chips.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">manufactures</a> approximately 90 percent of the world\u2019s advanced semiconductors, powering AI, military systems, and the global economy. Washington has been trying to change that.</p><p>TSMC\u2019s decision, made <a href=\"https://www.tsmc.com/static/abouttsmcaz/index.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than</a> five years ago, to build fabrication plants in the United States\u2014most notably a $40 billion investment in Arizona\u2014has been hailed as a move to bolster supply chain security and reduce dependence on East Asia. The project includes two advanced chip facilities in Phoenix, one of which is expected to manufacture cutting-edge 3-nanometer chips by 2026.</p><p>But Chen\u2019s comments reflect a deeper strategic reality: the most advanced nodes of chip manufacturing, engineering talent, and supply chain infrastructure remain deeply entrenched in Taiwan. The Arizona expansion may provide redundancy, but some experts believe it cannot fully replace the island\u2019s dominant role in global chip production. For Beijing, that leverage adds to the strategic calculus. For Washington, it highlights why Taiwan\u2019s security is inextricably linked to America\u2019s economic and national security interests.</p><p>\u201cSemiconductors are Taiwan\u2019s major strategic asset. But whether the recent investment in Arizona was TSMC\u2019s idea or happened under U.S. pressure is unclear,\u201d Liang-Chih Evans Chen, an associate research fellow at Taiwan\u2019s Institute for National Defense and Security Research, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt could be seen as Taiwan trying to spread its risk by diversifying manufacturing. That\u2019s a reasonable strategy, but it\u2019s not realistic to completely move TSMC out of Taiwan.\u201d</p><p>Beyond economics, the Taiwan Strait is also a maritime artery.</p><p>\u201cAbout 80 percent of ships in Asia pass through the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Shen notes. \u201cTaiwan also produces key technology components, like chips, that power global industries. A conflict would impact housing prices and economies worldwide.\u201d</p><p><strong>America\u2019s Unfinished Playbook</strong></p><p>Despite lacking formal diplomatic ties or a defense treaty with Taiwan, the U.S. remains the island\u2019s primary arms supplier and strategic partner. While President Trump\u2019s current remarks favor ambiguity\u2014he\u2019s declined to specify if he\u2019d defend Taiwan. His administration approved major arms sales to Taiwan and oversaw the highest-level U.S. visit in decades. The mixed signals complicate planning, but signal continuity in support.</p><p>Five months ago, the State Department quietly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/china-taiwan-us-state-department\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">removed</a> language that distanced the U.S. from supporting an independent Taiwan. In March, the G7 issued a firm rebuke of China\u2019s coercive tactics toward Taiwan, omitting the \u201cOne China\u201d language for the first time.</p><p>Vice President J.D. Vance has called China the \u201cbiggest threat\u201d to Washington. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth recently <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0uauGCYMRw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a> that \u201cthe threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent.\u201d</p><p>Still, ambiguity persists at the highest levels. Trump has declined to specify whether he would defend Taiwan, <a href=\"https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stating</a>, \u201cI don\u2019t want to ever put myself in that position.\u201d He has also said, \u201cTaiwan should pay us for defense.\u201d</p><p>Internal divisions and a slow-moving bureaucracy continue to be critical challenges.</p><p> \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a confirmed Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia. Same with the Pentagon\u2019s Indo-Pacific Security Affairs post. That leaves a massive vacuum in communication,\u201d stressed Alexander Huang. \u201cThere\u2019s no alliance treaty, no joint exercises, no shared doctrine, no direct communication network. How can they help? We don\u2019t even have interoperability \u2014 no Identification Friend or Foe system.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Leading security experts from the public and private sectors are gathering at The Cipher Brief Threat Conference October 19-22.

China\u2019s military dwarfs it, with an estimated two to three million personnel and theater commands focused on Taiwan.</p><p>\u201cAlthough they wouldn\u2019t mobilize their entire force, they have specific theater commands focused on Taiwan\u2026 and China could easily redirect forces from other regions if needed,\u201d observed Chen.</p><p>Taiwan is rapidly investing in submarines, drones, and advanced U.S.-made fighter jets. Yet delivery delays and domestic political gridlock complicate readiness.</p><p>\u201cDespite being eager to purchase more American arms, Taipei has struggled to receive its purchases in a timely fashion\u2014harming long-term readiness,\u201d Jack Burnham, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>.</p><p>A $6 billion defense budget cut by the KMT-majority legislature earlier this year further strained capabilities, experts lamented, <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202507010030#:~:text=The%20president%20then%20shifted%20focus,social%20media%20post%20Tuesday%20night.\" target=\"_blank\">prompting</a> pressure from President Lai for the frozen funds to be \u201cunfrozen\u201d in June. Still, the waiting game has many on edge.</p><p>\u201cThe first indigenous submarine was supposed to undergo trials this October, but it\u2019s already behind schedule,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWith budget cuts, we don\u2019t know what will happen with submarines two and three.\u201d</p><p>Experts also warn that most civilians remain unprepared for large-scale conflict.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re prepared in the same way we turn on Netflix every night and say, \u2018Oh, poor people in Ukraine or Gaza\u2014but not us!\u2019\u201d Alexander Huang points out. \u201cWe think we\u2019re the chosen ones, living on a beautiful island.\u201d</p><p>Should China act, Taiwan will require resupply from the U.S.\u2014missiles, fuel, medical kits, and more. Escorting convoys, running blockades, and challenging Chinese air superiority will almost certainly demand U.S. military intervention. Analysts underscore that the time for preparation is narrowing.</p><p>\u201cDuring an invasion scenario, Taiwan will eventually require resupply for everything from missiles to critical medical supplies,\u201d Liao surmises. \u201cEscorting such supply convoys and running a Chinese blockade would require U.S. intervention. There are very few scenarios where Taiwan can win alone.\u201d</p><p>But experts agree that if Taiwan falls, the global consequences will be felt far beyond the Taiwan Strait.</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

Inside the hotel ballroom where the governors had gathered, Michelle Lujan Grisham, the New Mexico governor, apologized for the noise but not the message. \u201cNew Mexicans are really loud,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>On the street, one sign read \u201cDefend Public Lands,\u201d with an image of an assault rifle. Others bore creative and bilingual profanities directed at Trump, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, who oversees most of the country\u2019s public acreage, and Sen. Mike Lee, the Republican from Utah, who on June 11 had proposed a large-scale selloff of public lands. Lee, who chairs the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, was not in Santa Fe, so the crowd focused on Burgum, who earlier that afternoon had addressed the governors about energy dominance and artificial intelligence. \u201cShow your face!\u201d the crowd chanted. But he had already departed the hotel through a back door. That night, a hunting group projected an image of him on the exterior wall of the hotel. \u201cBurgled by Burgum,\u201d it read.</p>\n\n<p>In the weeks before the meeting, the possibility of selling off large swaths of public lands had seemed as likely as at any time since the Reagan administration. On June 11, Lee had introduced an amendment to the megabill Congress was debating to reconcile the national budget. The amendment mandated the sale of up to 3 million acres of land controlled by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, with the vast majority of proceeds going to pay for tax cuts. Although Lee had framed his measure as a solution to the West\u2019s acute lack of affordable housing, it would have allowed developers to select the land they most desired. Under the amendment\u2019s original language, the ultimate power to nominate parcels for sale fell to Burgum and Brooke Rollins, head of the Department of Agriculture, which oversees the U.S. Forest Service.</p>\n\n<p>In the days after the Santa Fe protest, the outcry from hunting and outdoor recreation groups escalated across the West and the Senate parliamentarian ruled that Lee\u2019s amendment violated the chamber\u2019s rules. Republican lawmakers from Montana opposed the amendment; Burgum also distanced himself from it. (\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me at all if it\u2019s part of this bill,\u201d he told a reporter on June 26.)</p>\n\n<p>By the time Burgum made his comments, Lee\u2019s effort seemed doomed, and days later he announced that he was removing the amendment; public land advocates celebrated. \u201cThis win belongs to the hunters, anglers, and public landowners,\u201d wrote Patrick Berry, the president of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. But the celebration may have been premature. In a social media post announcing his decision, Lee indicated that he would revisit the issue: \u201cI continue to believe the federal government owns far too much land,\u201d he wrote. And powerful forces still support privatization. At the Santa Fe gathering, Rollins had been asked during a press conference about the effort to sell federal land. She told reporters she wasn\u2019t familiar with the specifics of Lee\u2019s amendment but supported his broader vision and suggested such efforts will continue regardless of the fate of the amendment. \u201cHalf of the land in the West is owned by the federal government,\u201d said Rollins. \u201cIs that really the right solution for the American people?\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Protestors gather outside the Eldorado Hotel &amp; Spa in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where the Western Governors\u2019 Association conference was held in June.\n    \n            (Dave Cox/Searchlight New Mexico)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n\n<p>The circumstances that led to Lee\u2019s proposal continue to simmer. The American West has an acute lack of affordable and attainable housing. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, Colorado, with a population of 6 million, is <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/gap/state/co\">lacking</a> 175,000 rental units for people who earn up to 50% of area median income. New Mexico, which has one-third of Colorado\u2019s population, is lacking 52,000 such rentals; Utah, 61,000. But nowhere is the issue as acute as in Nevada, where Las Vegas and Reno are encircled by public land. The state of 3.27 million is estimated to <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/gap/state/nv\">lack</a> 118,000 such rentals.</p>\n\n<p>The lack of housing emerged as a lever for Lee, who has sought to challenge federal control of public lands since he was first elected to the Senate in 2010. A year after winning his seat, he introduced a bill to sell a limited amount of public land, saying, \u201cThere is no critical need for the federal government to hold onto it.\u201d In 2013, he and others in his state\u2019s delegation wrote a letter demanding the transfer of federal lands to Utah and angrily accusing the Bureau of Land Management, which manages 245 million acres nationwide, of \u201cobvious abuse.\u201d And in a 2018 address at a think tank, he compared federal land managers \u2014 and people who recreate on public acreage \u2014 to feudal lords, ruling from far-off kingdoms on the coasts. He also denounced \u201celite publications\u201d that advocated for the protection of public lands, and he used the language of political war to describe the conflict over federal land: \u201cIt will take years, and the fight will be brutal.\u201d (Lee\u2019s office did not respond to detailed questions from ProPublica.)</p>\n\n<p>But this spring, Lee found support from unlikely places: the coastal elites he previously railed against seemed open to some of his ideas. The arguments in favor of privatization and development use a word of the season: abundance. Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson\u2019s bestselling book of the same name argues that burdensome regulatory processes have crushed the American housing market. While the authors focus on increasing supply in urban areas, in April, The New York Times ran an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/opinion/housing-crisis-federal-land.html\">op-ed</a> calling for building housing on public lands. That same week, the Times Magazine, in a piece titled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/magazine/suburban-sprawl-texas.html\">Why America Should Sprawl</a>,\u201d framed outward growth, including through the sale of public lands, as all but inevitable. The American Enterprise Institute, a free-market think tank, has estimated that the nation could build 3 million homes by opening federal land. In December, AEI leaders advocated for federal land sales in the <a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-homesteading-2-0-3233813/\">Las Vegas Review-Journal</a>, promising that disposal could \u201cusher in housing abundance and prosperity.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When pitching his land-sale bill, Lee adopted a more moderate tone than in years past, focusing squarely on housing. On June 20, he posted on X, \u201cThis is to help American families afford a home.\u201d On June 23: \u201cHousing prices are crushing families.\u201d The next day: \u201cThis land must go to American families.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>But it\u2019s challenging to build affordable housing on public land for a host of reasons, among them the high cost of infrastructure such as water pipelines and the cumbersome bureaucratic processes involving land agencies. But a primary obstacle is the price of that land itself: When it\u2019s sold at market rate, it\u2019s extremely difficult for developers to create affordable homes. \u201cHigh land costs alone can kill an otherwise great affordable housing project,\u201d said Waldon Swenson, vice president of corporate affairs for Nevada HAND, which builds affordable rental housing.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, past public land sales have created very little affordable housing. There\u2019s just one prominent test case, in Nevada, where a 1998 law enables the sale of federal land at market rate in the Las Vegas Valley and at steeply discounted prices throughout the state if it\u2019s to be used for affordable housing. Though municipalities can buy BLM land at $100 per acre to create affordable housing, the law has so far created just about 850 affordable units on 30 acres of land. By contrast, the law\u2019s market-value mechanism has enabled the sale of more than 17,000 acres of land at an average of more than $200,000 per acre. In March, the BLM <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/press-release/las-vegas-public-land-sale-nets-more-165-million-state-projects\">sold</a> 42 acres for $16.6 million. Meanwhile, according to a recent <a href=\"https://www.guinncenter.org/research/housing-affordability-in-nevada-an-economic-analysis-and-policy-considerations\">analysis</a>, rents in Clark and Washoe counties have respectively risen by 56% and 47% since 2018.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Lee\u2019s amendment did little to address these issues and lacked any definition of affordable or attainable housing. Furthermore, it allowed private developers to nominate parcels for sale \u2014 at market rate only. \u201cIt would be an unmitigated disaster,\u201d wrote Mark Squillace, a professor of natural resources law at the University of Colorado law school. John Leshy, a former solicitor for the Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration and an emeritus professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, said that the bill was \u201cnot a well-designed scheme to get more acres out there built with affordable houses.\u201d Leshy, the author of \u201cOur Common Ground: A History of America\u2019s Public Lands,\u201d added, \u201cI think it is just a ploy to get your toe in the door to start selling off lots of federal land.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            New houses were going up in Henderson, Nevada, in February. A 1998 law allows the sale of federal land at market rate in the Las Vegas Valley and at deep discounts throughout the state if it\u2019s to be used for affordable housing, which has led to the construction of some new units.\n    \n            (Sam Morris/Las Vegas Review-Journal/Tribune News Service/Getty Images)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n\n<p>Congress\u2019 stance toward public land shifted as settlers moved westward, violently displacing tribal nations. During the homesteading era, the General Land Office \u2014 a precursor to the BLM \u2014 was tasked with disposing of federal lands to states. But in the late 19th century, states began to request that Congress set aside lands for national forests. As a condition of its statehood, in 1896 Utah relinquished any claim to ownership of \u201cunappropriated public lands\u201d \u2014 an acknowledgment that appears in its state Constitution. As the conservation movement took off in the early 20th century, lawmakers and presidents set aside more public land. In 1976, Congress passed the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, which codified the BLM\u2019s role in stewarding lands and declared that they would remain public unless their sale served \u201cthe national interest.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Lee has lamented the impact of those historic changes on Utah, where 42% of the state is BLM land, saying in a 2018 speech, \u201cManifest destiny had left us behind, in some respects.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A movement in the 1970s tried to reverse those historical currents when Western ranchers and lawmakers calling themselves \u201cSagebrush Rebels\u201d sought to claim federal lands for states. They found sympathetic ears in Washington, D.C.: Ronald Reagan, during a 1980 campaign stop in Salt Lake City, said, \u201cCount me in as a rebel.\u201d Once elected, he nominated as secretary of the Interior James Watt, an attorney who favored transfer of public lands to the states. Reagan also came to rely on an economic adviser named Steve H. Hanke, who arrived at the White House from Johns Hopkins University. Hanke was more strident about getting rid of public lands than Watt; he has written that public lands \u201crepresent a huge socialist anomaly in America\u2019s capitalist system.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Hanke helped drive an ambitious effort to dispose of national forests and grazing lands, and in 1982 the Interior Department announced plans to sell millions of acres \u2014 as much as 5% of the public estate \u2014 in order to reduce the national debt. Hanke later joined The Heritage Foundation, entrenching the idea of privatizing lands at the conservative think tank and predicting that Americans would come around to his way of thinking. Since then, the foundation has regularly advocated for selling public lands. (The foundation did not respond to inquiries from ProPublica.)</p>\n\n<p>Lee is deeply tied into The Heritage Foundation, which he has called \u201ca guiding light for generations.\u201d In 2016, The Heritage Foundation suggested that Trump nominate Lee to the Supreme Court. Among Utah\u2019s leadership, his positions on federal land are widely held. Last year, the state attorney general filed suit to the United States Supreme Court, seeking to seize 18.5 million acres of federal public land. The court declined to hear the case.</p>\n\n<p>Public lands are popular, especially among hunters, hikers and off-roaders, and periodic efforts to sell them have incurred wrath. In 2017, Jason Chaffetz, the former Utah representative, retracted a disposal bill after a backlash. Last December, <a href=\"https://www.grandcanyontrust.org/blog/utah-voter-poll-2024-national-monuments-bears-ears-grand-staircase-escalante/\">a survey of 500 Utah voters</a> commissioned by the nonprofit Grand Canyon Trust found that a majority of both Democrats and Republicans supported preserving national monuments in the state. In its preelection policy recommendation known as Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation called for the privatization of everything from public education, using school-choice programs, to Medicare, by automatically enrolling patients in insurer-run plans. But it notably didn\u2019t call for the privatization of the public estate.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, Lee has recently focused the debate on affordable housing. In 2022 and 2023, Lee introduced legislation to sell Western lands called the HOUSES Act. The bill was more prescriptive than his reconciliation amendment: It only allowed states and municipalities to nominate lands for disposal, rather than developers, and it required that 85% of nominated parcels be developed as residential housing, at a minimum of four homes per acre, or as parks. But like his amendment to the reconciliation bill, Lee\u2019s HOUSES Act lacked a definition of affordable housing, and critics suggested that it would lead to the building of mansions. In both 2022 and 2023, when Lee reintroduced the bill, it did not pass out of committee.</p>\n\n<p>But it caught the attention of Kevin Corinth, then the staff director on the Joint Economic Committee, which advises Congress on financial matters. After leaving the Capitol, Corinth joined the American Enterprise Institute, which began focusing on building housing on federal lands. This March, AEI held an event with powerful developers to discuss its ideas, which it called \u201cHomesteading 2.0.\u201d Edward Pinto, a former Fannie Mae executive who helps oversee AEI\u2019s housing research, said during the event that the proposal \u201cgrew out of an effort that Sen. Lee undertook with the HOUSES Act.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>AEI advocates for dense development of single-family homes, but its ultimate vision remains opaque: The group has spoken of creating unregulated <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/startup-cities-donald-trump-legislation/\">\u201cfreedom cities\u201d</a> far from existing infrastructure, and its proposals for 3 million houses seem ambitious. Headwaters Economics, a nonprofit group in Montana, published an <a href=\"https://headwaterseconomics.org/public-lands/wildfire-public-land-housing/\">analysis</a> finding that existing public land could support less than 700,000 new homes; Nicholas Irwin, the research director for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas\u2019 Lied Center for Real Estate, said he found Headwaters\u2019 numbers more convincing.</p>\n\n<p>When I asked Pinto for a real-world example that illustrates his hopes for the West, he pointed to Summerlin, a planned community in Las Vegas, and Teravalis, a forthcoming development in Buckeye, Arizona, a rapidly expanding city at Phoenix\u2019s edge. Both are owned by Howard Hughes Holdings, a developer based in Texas.</p>\n\n<p>Housing in Summerlin is not easily attainable \u2014 its median home price approaches $700,000. Teravalis, meanwhile, was first proposed more than 20 years ago and has been beset by delays, in part due to ongoing litigation with the state, which claims that the developer has not proven that it can obtain a sufficient water supply. A spokesperson for Howard Hughes Holdings, which bought the development in 2021, wrote that the company is \u201cworking with local stakeholders around long-term water policy to support the full build out of Teravalis for more than 300,000 residents over several decades.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, Pershing Square Holdings, which is controlled by the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, purchased $900 million of stock in the company. (Ackman, a prominent supporter of Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, is now the executive chairman of Hughes\u2019 board of directors. Through a spokesperson, he declined to comment for this article.)</p>\n\n<p>Teravalis\u2019 first lots sold for a steep $777,000 per acre without homes on them, and Hughes\u2019 plans are for 2.8 dwellings per acre \u2014 less than a quarter of the figure that Pinto cited as ideal for naturally affordable housing. Hughes is currently planning a grand opening for November. The company did not say how much homes would cost, but a spokesperson wrote in a statement, \u201cThe need for new housing in the Phoenix West Valley is urgent, and Teravalis will help meet that demand.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute cited Teravalis, a planned community in Buckeye, Arizona, as the kind of development that could be built with sales of more public lands.\n    \n            (Adriana Zehbrauskas/The Washington Post/Getty Images)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>When given the option, developers often pursue the profit margins of high-end housing. In 1998, Congress passed a law, the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act, that allows any of the state\u2019s municipalities to request the sale of federal lands for affordable housing. (SNPLMA relies on the Department of Housing and Urban Development to define affordable housing, which it says are units within reach of those making up to 80% of the area\u2019s median income.) Still, to date, only about 900 acres have been set aside for affordable housing projects under the law \u2014 and only 30 of those acres have been developed into homes where low-income residents can actually live.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s unclear why so few affordable housing projects have been built at a time when they are so desperately needed. Clark County Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick attributed it to bureaucratic delays: \u201cIt\u2019s taken a long time to get through the process with the BLM.\u201d According to Maurice Page, executive director of the Nevada Housing Coalition, the average time the BLM takes to review projects has recently dropped \u2014 from between three and five years to one. Only at that point can a developer close a deal. Tina Frias, CEO of the Southern Nevada Home Builders Association, said such delays can be crippling.</p>\n\n<p>In 2023, the BLM began selling Nevada land for affordable housing for $100 per acre. (Previous SNPLMA affordable housing sales had averaged nearly $35,000 per acre.) Still, local authorities have not requested the transfer of many parcels in recent years. According to the BLM, only three new affordable housing projects are moving toward approval.</p>\n\n<p>In a statement, a spokesperson for the agency wrote, \u201cBLM Nevada can only offer land after it has been nominated by an eligible entity and BLM has confirmed that there are no encumbrances or restrictions on the parcel. In many cases, the restrictions referenced by stakeholders originate with the nominating entities themselves.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>SNPLMA\u2019s affordable housing mechanism is also poorly understood. Alexis Hill, the chair of Washoe County\u2019s board of commissioners, which includes Reno, told me she didn\u2019t know whether the affordable housing provision applied there. (It does.) When I asked Biden\u2019s former BLM director, Tracy Stone-Manning, who now leads The Wilderness Society, whether the $100-per-acre provision was applicable statewide, she said she did not know. Squillace, the Colorado law professor, also admitted he wasn\u2019t sure how widely the provision applied.</p>\n\n<p>Steve Aichroth, the administrator of the Nevada Housing Division, acknowledged a disconnect between agencies. His office is hiring an official to work with municipalities and the BLM. \u201cIf you came back to us in about a year we\u2019d have better answers,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, both of the state\u2019s Democratic senators, Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto, have proposed legislation that would open federal acreage for housing and transfer it to trust land for tribal nations \u2014 while protecting other territory for conservation. The governor, Joe Lombardo, a Republican, recently signed a bill to invest $183 million of state money in developing housing for lower- and middle-class residents. Elsewhere in the West, New Mexico is leasing state lands to develop apartments. In Utah, the state housing office is encouraging cities to change zoning requirements to increase density; it is also using public funds to finance private developments and looking to build on state lands. Before Lee pulled his amendment, I spoke with Steve Waldrip, who directs housing strategy for Utah Gov. Spencer Cox. During our conversation, Waldrip expressed concern that the hyperpoliticized debate around a broad federal land sell-off was hampering focused efforts to alleviate the region\u2019s housing crisis. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet that\u2019s going to solve the affordability crisis,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>But some continue to believe a simple solution exists. After Lee\u2019s amendment died, I spoke with Pinto, who directs AEI\u2019s efforts to push for housing on federal lands. He struck a conciliatory tone, given the political climate. (The sweeping GOP bill passed Thursday without Lee\u2019s amendment.) At the moment, Pinto said, there doesn\u2019t appear to be an easy route to sell large swaths of public land for development. \u201cThe path forward is to have a much more targeted approach.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In Nevada, such a thing is already happening. Last year Clark County bought 20 acres from the BLM for $2,000, and the county\u2019s plan is to turn that land into single-family houses for first-time homebuyers. This spring, a new affordable housing development opened in Las Vegas \u2014 an apartment complex for people 55 and older with rent starting at $573. The project was built by a developer called Ovation on former public land that was transferred through SNPLMA. It had taken a while \u2014 the deal was first proposed in February 2020. But recently, the pace of transfers has picked up. Ovation says it\u2019s also working on a similar project in the city of Henderson. It was nominated for BLM approval last February and, according to Jess Molasky, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, \u201cWe hope to be in the ground in the first quarter of next year.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/gabriel-sandoval\">Gabriel Sandoval</a> contributed research.</p>",

Trump has returned to office with the renewed revelations that Chinese government-affiliated hackers continue to outmatch America\u2019s critical infrastructure cyber defenders through sabotage and espionage campaigns such as Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon.</p><p>The new Trump Administration must rebalance the cyber battlefield in America\u2019s favor by raising and incentivizing cybersecurity standards for the electric, oil and gas, nuclear power, water, telecommunications, financial services, public health, transportation, and other critical infrastructure sectors. </p><p>The mechanism would be the U.S. government, insurance providers, critical infrastructure operators, and technology providers collaboratively defining and maintaining data-based \u201cgood\u201d standards for each sector, building on the greatest strengths of the public and private domains for a \u201ccommon defense\u201d of the homeland, with cyberspace being recognized and prioritized as the first line of defense. </p><p>A new national security prioritization schema is essential because, unlike our traditional, kinetic focused military components, every moment of every day, America\u2019s public and private sector cyber warriors are battling nation-states in cyberspace. We must respond accordingly.</p><p><strong>Raising Standards through Transparency and Accountability</strong></p><p>The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) currently mandates high cyber defense standards for corporate members of the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). The new Trump team should extend this standard-setting practice, partnering with the insurance industry to establish high standards for America\u2019s private critical infrastructure operators.</p><p>The insurance industry would leverage its experience with cyber incident data from hundreds of thousands of cyber incidents to help government set these minimum standards across sectors and functions within sectors. </p><p>The government would require operators to establish Cybersecurity Information Centers (CICs) to audit organizational standards compliance, report their results to the government, and inform the management of their internal cyber security posture.</p><p>In much the same way that U.S. public companies are required to report financial results following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the CIC reporting standard would provide the government and insurers important visibility into operator risk and provide operators a standardized framework for cyber risk management. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Join us in Sea Island, Georgia for The Cipher Brief's </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>2025 Threat Conference</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> from October 19-22.

The 2020 bi-partisan Congressional Cyber Solarium Commission (CSC) made recommendations for \u201coperationalizing cybersecurity collaboration\u201d in relevant information sharing between the government and private sector. </p><p>President Joe Biden\u2019s <a href=\"https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/nsm/nsm-22.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>2024 National Security Memorandum on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience (NSM-22)</u></a> built on the CSC\u2019s Congressional consensus by establishing \u201cthe appropriate sharing of timely, actionable information\u201d through a \u201crobust information sharing environment\u201d that enables actions and outcomes that reduce cyber risk. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/topics/partnerships-and-collaboration/joint-cyber-defense-collaborative\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC)</u></a> established by Congress under the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) through the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act provides the ideal structure for gathering and processing CIC data. </p><p><strong>How CICs Would Work in Action</strong></p><p>The government and insurance providers would leverage CIC data to monitor each operator\u2019s progress (or lack thereof) in meeting their standards and determine action based on the risks posed to the American people.</p><p>For instance, the government and insurers would set a ground truth of \u201cgood\u201d cybersecurity standards for a local water utility. The water utility\u2019s CIC would continuously monitor its cyber risks against the sector\u2019s ground truth. The water operator, the government, and insurance companies would be informed of whether the utility complies and how well it performs compared to other operators. </p><p>Through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), industry regulators, and potential reinsurance vehicles, the government would work with the insurance industry to mandate compliance or the water utility would be denied cyber insurance coverage. </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Sign up for the </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Cyber Initiatives Group</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day \u2013 directly to your inbox.

The federal government would use CIC insights to invest intelligently in cyber grants for cash-poor state and local entities such as water utilities. Through these smart grants, the government would assume the role of \u201ccyber insurer of last resort\u201d, shifting the risk of catastrophic cyber-attacks from the weakest and most vulnerable operators to the federal government. </p><p>The CIC insights would also inform and bolster CISA\u2019s JCDC efforts to protect vulnerable operators and, where necessary, engage the unique capabilities of the <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/About/Cybersecurity-Collaboration-Center/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>National Security Agency\u2019s Cybersecurity Collaboration Center (CCC)</u></a>.</p><p>Finally, the administration could unleash a private sector boom in cybersecurity and risk management innovation by enabling technology solution providers to conduct the CIC standards audits. Beyond creating a market for audits, the government could share anonymized versions of the overall pool of CIC data to enable private sector partners to develop and train better cyber solutions. </p><p><strong>America\u2019s Common Defense, Built on Public-Private Collaboration</strong></p><p>Vulnerable populations in medieval times responded to existential threats by collaborating for a \u201ccommon defense\u201d through the construction of walls around their villages. From our nation\u2019s very beginning it was the federal government that maintained a \u201ccommon defense\u201d for our citizens, consistently relying upon, amongst other things, two great oceans, and mostly friendly neighbors to the north and south to serve as 20th century defensive walls to protect us. </p><p>In 2025, the new Trump Administration has a unique opportunity to build a new public-private collaboration framework that builds cyber \u201cwalls\u201d to fill remaining digital gaps and effectively provides for our national \u201ccommon cyber defense\u201d.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT Q&amp;A \u2014 </strong><em><em>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in Washington D.C. on Monday to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House \u2014 their third meeting this year. Netanyahu\u2019s visit follows the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran last month. Two items are at the top of Trump\u2019s agenda for the meeting: a ceasefire deal on Gaza, and a nuclear deal with Iran.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Before Netanyahu touched down in the U.S., The Cipher Brief spoke with Ambassador Gary Grappo, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Oman and Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, to discuss the dynamics and outcomes he is on the lookout for at the Trump-Netanyahu meeting. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. You can watch the full discussion on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaxOCtsvOjE\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief YouTube Channel</a>.</em></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>What are you going to be looking for as this meeting unfolds?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>The last time the president and Mr. Netanyahu met, it was very much a Trump-dominated visit. They had a public event in which Mr. Netanyahu shockingly spoke very, very little and even seemed a bit submissive. I'll be interested to see how that dynamic plays out in this visit. I expect it to be very, very different. And secondly, looking at the actual specifics, what comes out of this, what they discuss, what are the issues that they focus on and address, the circumstances of this visit, of course, are very, different from Mr. Netanyahu's previous visits to the White House since Trump took office. </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>We know President Trump is very much interested in a deal on the war in Gaza, and also vis-a-vis Iran. It does seem that Prime Minister Netanyahu may be a little less eager. Let's talk about Gaza first. The U.S. hasn't had much success in this administration or the Biden administration before it in pressuring or using its leverage against Israel to get any changes in terms of the prosecution of that war. Do you think it's a different circumstance now?</p><p> <em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>It is a different circumstance. Certainly the dynamic in Gaza has changed very, very little since the last time they met. The Israelis unquestionably hold the upper hand. They literally control between 60-70 percent of the territory of Gaza. They're continuing their efforts to root out Hamas throughout the territory, as challenging as that is now since they're more dispersed, deeply hidden and it's requiring that the IDF to employ different tactics than they may have earlier on in the war.</p><p>But what has really changed is Iran and what has taken place in Iran over the course of the last month to six weeks, with Iran now greatly weakened. Its threat in terms of its nuclear weapons is much diminished thanks primarily to the efforts of the Israelis, but also to the United States and specifically the decision of Donald Trump to enter the war as he did with the dropping of those bunker buster bombs. So there'll be a bit of a good feeling coming out of that, and deservedly so for both sides. And that is going to factor in, I think, into the conversation they have about Gaza.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>Is it essentially that Trump may feel the U.S. did what Israel had been asking us to do for some time with those bunker busters against Iran, and now we'd like Israel to come to the table and push the Gaza deal over the line, assuming, of course, that Hamas is OK with some of those final provisions? Is that the game here?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>That\u2019s certainly one factor here. Donald Trump did jump into a fray that he initially was very reluctant to join \u2014 he had said so publicly before Israel started its first series of attacks on Iran earlier in June. There\u2019ll be something of that in Donald Trump's conversation with Bibi, but also the fact that now with the great danger tamed in Iran, Bibi has much more room for maneuver, including from right-wing members who have threatened to leave his coalition unless he followed a pretty hard-line approach to Gaza, but also Iran. They may be less of a threat now, given the fact that the threat from Iran has diminished.</p><p>And there's a third factor here, and Donald Trump has hinted to this in the last week to 10 days, and that is the charges hanging over Bibi Netanyahu's head. Donald Trump has intimated making a statement that these charges should be dismissed. Mr. Trump is very, very popular in Israel, and if he's making statements like this, which is inserting himself into the judicial process in Israel in a very direct way, it can have a very telling effect on Netanyahu's right wing \u2014 even if they threaten to leave, Mr. Netanyahu may stand a better chance in any elections which might result from the collapse of his coalition.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there.

Donald Trump would love what he would consider a good deal with Iran. Netanyahu and that right flank, not so much.</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>No, not at all. Trump very, very much fears getting drawn into another Middle East war and to allow the Israelis to press the advantage, which they may very well do even without the United States. There\u2019s the fear that once again, the Americans may be drawn into the conflict, particularly given the likelihood that the Iranians are going to move to expedite the development of their weapons program, whatever its current state may be. And there seems to still be some question about how much of the more highly enriched uranium they have, how many centrifuges they may still have and where they are located, which could require another American intervention. And I think Trump is fearful of that.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>The question of the Trump administration's leverage is interesting. I was struck by the fact that during that period when a ceasefire was first agreed to, to end this recent 12-day campaign in Iran, there was a moment when President Trump took to social media to say to the Israelis, stop those bombers. It does seem like at least for the short term, he'd like the Israelis to lay low, right?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>Absolutely. Don't forget Mr. Trump has his right wing to answer to as well. It was known from the outset that some of his more hardline supporters were very much opposed to the American intervention in Iran and still are despite the obvious success of the American involvement. They really would like to see us close the book on our intervention there because they also see a real danger of the Americans being further entrapped, they would say, in another Middle East war if the Israelis decide, as you say, to press the advantage.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em>We spoke soon after President Trump had announced his arrangement under which the U.S. would take control in Gaza. Whatever happened to that?</p><p><em><strong><em>Ambassador Grappo: </em></strong></em>It has been forgotten, but I think it's been put on the shelf, which in fact has become a library of plans for settling the Israeli-Palestinian dispute that never get implemented. I just don't see it as a possibility. What we're currently discussing is a ceasefire, and there are some signs that Hamas may be taking it a little more seriously than they have previously. The Israelis have indicated their willingness to accept it, although I'm sure there are some caveats. But what the administration would like to see is the ceasefire go into effect with assurances provided by the United States that negotiations for a permanent end to the conflict would continue during this 60-day period. And I'm not sure the Israelis are prepared to agree to that. I'll have to see. I'm sure that'll be a discussion point when they meet.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

They do not want to see a continuation of an active conflict in Iran. So they will be hoping that the president can keep the lid on that.</p><p>And then secondly, for Mr. Trump, [the normalization of Israeli-Saudi ties] still remains his ace in the hole. This is something that Bibi Netanyahu very, very much wants to have \u2014 it would be a signature achievement, but that's going to require an acceptable solution to the war in Gaza. And so that's an ace in the hole for Trump if he decides to play it, if he has spoken at all with the Saudis about this possibility. They have previously indicated their hesitancy to enter into any normalization talks without a clear path toward a Palestinian state. They might be willing to accept some general verbiage around that point without necessarily committing to a Palestinian state in terms of a time frame. But they very much want to see an end to this war and a change in the predicament of the Palestinian people of Gaza who still remain suffering, huddled up in a very, very small area with food shortages, even famine and starvation in some areas. A massive humanitarian effort is going to be necessary.</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> on YouTube?

Last month, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/fda-tacrolimus-kidney-transplant-patient\">ProPublica reported</a> that a generic immunosuppression drug for transplant patients could dissolve too quickly when ingested, increasing the risk of kidney failure. The drug was made at an Indian factory with a history of quality violations that was banned from the U.S. market. The company previously told ProPublica it believes the medication is safe.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In April, more than <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge-fact-sheet.html\">3,500</a> FDA employees were laid off under U.S. Department and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a roughly 15% reduction in force. \u201cWe aren\u2019t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge.html\">Kennedy said</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, the agency said the reductions would not impact inspectors. Kennedy has since announced that HHS would reverse 20% of the cuts across the agency. Amid <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-to-reverse-some-layoffs-food-drug-safety/\">news reports</a> describing the layoffs at the FDA, Kennedy did not specify how many people would be reinstated.</p>\n\n<p>ProPublica spoke to 10 current and former FDA staff members and leaders in recent weeks, including inspectors who said that the loss of support staff has slowed critical investigations and that little relief has materialized. Most declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly or feared backlash within the industry as they search for new jobs.</p>\n\n<p>One veteran drug inspector said nearly 70 people who helped arrange travel, budgets, translators and contingency plans for investigations were laid off. Only about one-third have been brought back, forcing a handful of busy managers to coordinate travel clearances and visas for inspections that can span weeks and include stops in multiple countries.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get inspections done,\u201d the investigator said. \u201cThe pace has slowed down. You can\u2019t inspect as many sites.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In an email, an HHS spokesperson said inspections have not been affected by downsizing. The agency did not address questions about how many people have been let go or reinstated or whether additional help will be brought on.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo be clear, FDA inspectors were not impacted, and this critical work continues,\u201d the agency said.</p>\n\n<p>Two former FDA commissioners and the agency\u2019s longtime head of drug safety, however, said that the loss of support staff has undermined one of the FDA\u2019s most essential missions at a time when Americans get most of their generic drugs from overseas manufacturers. That includes chemotherapy treatments, sedatives, antibiotics and medications on hospital crash carts.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like saying, \u2018Oh we didn\u2019t fire any of the doctors or nurses at the hospital, but we fired all the lab techs, all the orderlies, all the phlebotomists \u2026 oh, but the doctors and nurses are still left so it\u2019s fine,\u2019\u201d said Janet Woodcock, who ran the agency\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research for more than two decades and retired in 2024. \u201cA lot of the connective tissue that deals with drug safety and similar things are going to be missing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the staff cuts, the departures of some longtime investigators and leaders in recent months have left less experienced people tasked with rooting out dangerous and sometimes deceptive manufacturing practices.</p>\n\n<p>The investigative unit, which looks into potential safety issues with drugs, vaccines, medical devices and other products, has had a retention problem for years. Inspectors leave so often that even with hiring blitzes, the FDA has been unable to get ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Between 2022 and 2024, the agency hired 105 inspectors but about the same number left, leaving the inspection pool with about 230 people, according to <a href=\"https://files.gao.gov/reports/GAO-25-106775/index.html\">the Government Accountability Office</a>, the watchdog arm of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>About one-third did not have the experience to conduct independent foreign inspections, the GAO found.</p>\n\n<p>Two FDA inspectors said the agency needs an additional 100 to 200 experienced investigators to do the work.</p>\n\n<p>The job can be grueling. Some inspectors who travel to overseas drug-making factories can be away for as long as 15 weeks a year. Some have described threats of violence by company managers, days on planes and trains in oppressive heat and long nights preparing inspection reports before they head to the next stop.</p>\n\n<p>The loss of experienced investigators and cuts to support staff have also hamstrung other inspectors.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am in utter shock that they don\u2019t support and promote those of us who can do a decent inspection,\u201d said one investigator who scrutinizes factories that produce vaccines, cell therapies and other biological products. \u201cYou\u2019re adding to the chaos.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>Dozens of employees who handled technology support, facilities, supplies and equipment were dismissed as well, snarling some day-to-day operations at the agency. One current employee recalled how a colleague couldn\u2019t find replacement batteries for a computer mouse and how another locked herself out of her office and couldn\u2019t get back in because there was no one to open the door.</p>\n\n<p>Even before the layoffs, the FDA\u2019s investigative force <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-106775\">struggled to monitor</a> drug-making factories in countries that include India and China, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising alarms in Congress that serious manufacturing lapses may have gone unchecked. The FDA received more than 1 million reports from doctors, patients and others in 2023 about product quality issues or consumers who had adverse reactions to drugs, FDA data shows.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThings will be missed,\u201d former FDA inspector Patrick Stone said about the layoffs. \u201cWe are going to have a lot less safe drugs.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration has said little about the layoffs in recent weeks, though <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-health-secretary-kennedy-says-he-brought-back-722-cdc-employees-220-nih-2025-06-24/\">Kennedy told Congress</a> late last month that more than 900 employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health had been reinstated.</p>\n\n<p>The FDA <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-announces-expanded-use-unannounced-inspections-foreign-manufacturing-facilities\">announced in May</a> that it would expand the use of unannounced inspections at overseas factories, a move that some members of Congress have been <a href=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/grassley-at-hearing-on-foreign-drug-manufacturing-inspection-oversight\">pushing</a> for years. And FDA Commissioner Marty Makary <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-launches-agency-wide-ai-tool-optimize-performance-american-people\">announced</a> that a new AI tool known as Elsa would help identify inspection targets.</p>\n\n<p>Current and former employees others say that won\u2019t make up for the losses.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just expect the inspector to take care of all the complexities of organizing their trips overseas,\u201d said former FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, who served under the Obama administration. \u201cEven though it might be said we\u2019ve kept the inspectors, that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ve kept the infrastructure \u2026 that actually supports safe and meaningful inspections.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/brandon-roberts\">Brandon Roberts</a> contributed data analysis.</p>\n\n        \n\n    \n          \n                \n            Correction\n            <p><strong>July 8, 2025:</strong> This story originally misstated the year that Janet Woodcock retired from the Food and Drug Administration.

Netanyahu continues to push a no-holds-barred war in Gaza and an uncompromising position on Iran and its nuclear program; Donald Trump is looking to make deals on both fronts.</p><p>Publicly, Trump and Netanyahu will no doubt cheer the success of recent strikes against Iran and the coordination that was evident between the two nations during that 12-day war. In the wake of those attacks, Trump offered to negotiate with Iran, and he has repeatedly urged Israel and Hamas to accept what he calls a \u201cfinal proposal\u201d for a Gaza truce. </p><p>These are the latest in a series of efforts the President has made to make peace on the global stage. As a candidate, Trump promised quick solutions to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and since his second inaugural, he has expended significant diplomatic efforts on Iran and global trade disputes as well. And other than a few trade agreements, he has made no major deals as yet. Might the Netanyahu visit change that? </p><p>Experts say the hurdles involve domestic pressures on the Israeli Prime Minister, who has shown little interest in deals that don\u2019t suit the right-wing nationalists in his government.</p><p>\u201cFor Netanyahu, there are domestic political concerns that are influencing his enthusiasm about proceeding with a ceasefire [in Gaza] or formal negotiations with Iran,\u201d Jason Campbell, Senior Fellow at The Middle East Institute, told The Cipher Brief. \u201cI think that will continue to be a flashpoint in his discussions with President Trump.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Ambassador Gary Grappo, whose diplomatic career included high-level postings in Oman, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, said that Trump\u2019s decision to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2013 something Netanyahu clearly wanted the U.S. to do \u2013 may help him press the Israeli leader to halt his campaign in Gaza.</p><p>\u201cDonald Trump jumped into a fray that initially he was very reluctant to join, and had said so publicly before Israel started its first series of attacks on Iran,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. He expects Trump to use that \u201cbig favor to Israel,\u201d as he called it, in his discussions with Netanyahu. </p><p><strong>A rare rift</strong></p><p>Although President Trump has boasted frequently of his close relationship to Israel \u2013 the country \u201chas never had a better friend in the White House,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/8/trump-tells-jewish-americans-he-is-israels-best-friend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a> during his first term. But he has stymied Netanyahu several times since his return to office. </p><p>The last time the Israeli Prime Minister came to the White House, Trump refused to give him a green light for attacking Iran, and just days before Israel\u2019s strikes last month, he <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/trump-told-netanyahu-not-strike-iran-nuclear\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said publicly</a> that such attacks would be \u201cinappropriate.\u201d </p><p>Earlier this year, Netanyahu <a href=\"https://jweekly.com/2025/05/07/us-announces-truce-with-houthis-without-telling-israel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">was reportedly furious</a> to learn that the Trump administration had negotiated directly with Hamas to free U.S. hostages, and that the White House had ended its campaign against Houthi militants without informing Israel.

I don't think that's what Netanyahu would want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is some distance between the positions of Mr. Trump and the Israeli government, including Mr. Netanyahu, on Iran,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cAnd don't forget Mr. Trump has his right wing to answer to as well. It was known from the outset that some of his more hardline supporters were very much opposed to the American intervention in Iran and still are\u2026They also see a real danger of the Americans being further entrapped in another Middle East war if the Israelis decide to press the advantage.\u201d</p><p><strong>The Saudi factor \u2013 and the Gaza \u201cRiviera\u201d</strong></p><p>Beyond Gaza and Iran, President Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d Middle East deal involves another major power in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia. Trump\u2019s singular foreign policy achievement during his first term was the so-called Abraham Accords, which produced peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. And he has made clear his wish to bring Saudi Arabia into those agreements.</p><p>The Biden administration was pursuing a Saudi-Israeli rapprochement as well, but all progress on that front ended abruptly with the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and the war on Gaza that followed. Saudi Arabia has insisted on a peace deal in Gaza and a plan for a Palestinian state as prerequisites for entering into any deal with the Israelis. Trump would love to be seen as the architect of this new and potentially critical piece of the Abraham Accords, and certainly the Israelis would love to see it happen. </p><p>\u201cFor Mr. Trump, this still remains his ace in the hole,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cIt's something that Bibi Netanyahu very, very much wants to have. It would be a signature achievement to have normalization of Israeli-Saudi ties, but that's going to require an acceptable solution to the war in Gaza. And so that's an ace in the hole for Trump if he decides to play it.\u201d</p><p>One thing is clear, as Netanyahu heads for Washington: Trump\u2019s last big plan for Gaza \u2013 the idea that the U.S. would take over the territory and create a real-estate bonanza on the \u201cRiviera\u201d \u2013 is no longer in the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI think it's been forgotten,\u201d Amb. Grappo said. \u201cOr at least it's been put on the shelf, and that shelf has over the years, become a library of plans for settling the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>It pays to be a Subscriber+Member.

    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/to-counter-china-reform-u-s-intelligence-for-the-digital-age",
    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION --</strong> The United States is facing a quiet and rapidly growing threat across the digital landscape, an unseen mathematical space of binary code and shadowy actors. This landscape demands more, not less, attention, and urgently, if the U.S. is to win the strategic competition of this generation.</p><p>The most sophisticated and ambitious of our adversaries is the government of the People's Republic of China in Beijing, which is pursuing an aggressive national strategy to undermine America's digital future.</p><p>More than 20 years have passed since the last major reorganization of the U.S. intelligence community. In that time, the adversarial threat landscape has changed dramatically, and technology has become central to the intelligence mission. With ever-increasing demands being placed on the Intelligence Community (IC) in a time of fiscal constraint, it is right to ask whether it is optimized for the emerging threats of tomorrow. It is not.</p><p>Given these stakes, lawmakers and national security leaders debating the most significant reforms since 2004 face a critical choice: focus on the real challenges posed by China's digital strategy or become mired in bureaucratic reshuffling.</p><p>The current debate in Washington, focused on the Intelligence Community Efficiency and Effectiveness Act of 2025, exemplifies this risk. It proposes substantial cuts and a restructuring of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which has indeed grown beyond its envisioned size and narrow mission. While ODNI's future size and structure merit discussion, that topic should not distract policymakers with arguments over bureaucratic power, resources, and prestige while missing the bigger, more urgent picture.</p><p>The true measure of reform should not be judged by organizational charts, which rarely impact mission success. The core issues are aligning skills and resources with our most pressing challenges, eliminating bureaucracy that fails to contribute meaningfully to the mission, and unleashing American innovation. Importantly, it is also the candid acknowledgment that espionage demands audacity, agility and risk in the field and in the technical ops center, the so-called pointy end of the spear. Yet institutional incentives often discourage the calculated risks essential to effective intelligence work, creating structural barriers to the bold action required in today's digital intelligence mission.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em></em></p><p>A central challenge faced by the IC is the PRC's aggressive national digital strategy, which explicitly aims for global dominance in artificial intelligence by 2030. Beijing views AI as critical infrastructure for national security and geopolitical influence, backing it with extensive state investment and a military-civil fusion program to weaponize civilian technology. To effectively counter this, the U.S. IC must achieve and maintain dominance in all digital domains where China's advancements are most pronounced.</p><p>Cyber Collection and Defense: China increasingly leverages AI-driven automation to conduct sophisticated cyber espionage, systematically compromising critical U.S. infrastructure, intellectual property, and defense-related information. Yet our current cyber capabilities are hampered by antiquated acquisition processes that treat software like hardware, sometimes taking years to field capabilities that adversaries deploy on rapid timelines.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence: Beijing uses powerful AI algorithms to analyze vast datasets, including the personal and biometric data of Americans, to significantly enhance the precision and scale of its espionage. Meanwhile, IC agencies struggle with bureaucratic barriers that prevent rapid adoption of commercial AI tools and make it difficult to partner with smaller tech companies who are leading innovation in this space.</p><p>Strategic Data Acquisition: China's comprehensive data strategy treats information as a strategic asset, harvesting it from commercial, governmental, and individual sources to fuel its AI systems. Naturally, the IC\u2019s ability to leverage open-source data is limited by its available budget, but this is an area worthy of modest additional investment to benefit the mission of all IC members.</p><p>Information Operations: Chinese state actors utilize generative AI tools, including advanced deepfakes and social media manipulation, to propagate disinformation, deepen societal divisions, and reshape the global digital landscape to align with China's objectives. The IC must quickly improve its ability to identify and counter such efforts at scale and at machine speed, which will require investment in sophisticated technical capabilities now, not someday.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Upgrade your access to exclusive content by <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\">becoming a subscriber</a>.</strong> </em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Real reform demands breaking and rebuilding an outdated acquisitions process designed for analog-era weapon systems. Consider this reality: while China can deploy new cyber capabilities on rapid timelines, the IC can take up to two years to procure and field comparable digital tools due to processes designed for a bygone analog era. Creating fast-track authorities means establishing dedicated pathways where software and digital services can be evaluated, tested, and deployed within weeks rather than following traditional procurement timelines. This also requires a concerted effort to drive genuine partnerships between government and private industry, the true engines of innovation, by creating new pathways for tech talent to serve short tours in government and streamlining how the IC adopts commercial technology.</p><p>Critics rightfully worry that rapid acquisition could compromise security or oversight. The solution is not slower processes, but smarter ones that leverage new AI capabilities by creating streamlined security reviews specifically designed for software, implementing continuous monitoring instead of front-loaded approvals (the one-and-done approach), and building accountability mechanisms that match the speed of digital threats.</p><p>The goal of intelligence reform should be clear: promote a culture of bold risk-taking, eliminate bureaucracy where it merely perpetuates itself, ruthlessly drive efficiency to free up precious resources, and reallocate those resources to the challenges of the future rather than the structures of the past. This requires immediate action from Congress to establish new acquisition authorities, from IC leadership to restructure internal processes, and from the private sector to engage more deeply with national security missions.</p><p>It would be a mistake to squander precious time in debates over bureaucratic power while our adversaries move forward aggressively. The United States must match and surpass their speed, innovation, and audacity, focusing exclusively on the real challenges ahead to secure America's digital future.

U.S. forces are deemed potential targets of retaliation and one U.S. airbase in Qatar did come under attack, albeit a largely symbolic one.</em></em></p><p><em><em>The Cipher Brief spoke with General Frank McKenzie (Ret.), who oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East as the head of U.S. Central Command from 2019 to 2022, about the mission and vulnerability of U.S. troops in the region, and what might happen if they were to leave. Our interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>The Iraq War is long over. The United States - in a coalition - defeated ISIS some time ago. The Afghan War is over. What is the mission or are the missions of all those troops that remain in the Middle East?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie: </em></strong></em>I would argue that the fight against ISIS still goes on. We don't actually fight that fight ourselves, but we do support our partners both in Iraq and in Syria who continue to conduct operations against ISIS, which is now newly flourishing based on the turmoil in Syria. That may correct itself over the next few months with the new government, which I think is a good thing. So we're still in that fight a little bit. But to your basic question, our forces are there to train our partners in the region, to work with them, to provide assurance of American presence, and that's largely focused on Iran. Iran remains a singular threat in the region, and we've seen over the last few months, why we need to be very aware and alert to the threat from Iran.</p><p>The other thing is that while we do have a lot of forces in the region, they are distributed. We defended ourselves very effectively against an Iranian attack a few days ago. And forces also provide assurance to our neighbors while they deter action by our potential opponents. Our friends in the region can't leave. They're stuck there, so the fact that U.S. forces are there actually adds to their level of assurance that we'll be a reliable partner should Iran attack them.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>A good many of those American troops are there at the invitation, if not the request, of some of the Gulf states. That's of course not the case for different reasons in Iraq and Syria. To what extent is the U.S. presence, in your view, an answer to those kinds of requests? And to what extent is it strategically smart for the United States?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie:</em></strong></em> It\u2019s a combination of both. It certainly serves our interest to maintain a presence in the region. It certainly serves the interests of the Gulf States and other states that we be there in order to give them additional stability as they confront the threat from Iran. So I think it serves both our interests. We\u2019re actually in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government now. I think we have an ongoing negotiation process with the Iraqis about what our force posture is going to be. So we're in Iraq because the Iraqis want us to be there, not because we're forcing ourselves on the Iraqis.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

We could leave the region, and that's talked about fairly frequently. If we left the region and drew down dramatically, then that assurance component would go away and they would also be, as an effective operational matter, far more vulnerable to attacks from Iran. We've seen how willing Iran is to actually use their military to attack their neighbors over the last few months. That's the thing to cover when we look at why our forces are there: what effects do we derive? Assurance and deterrence against Iranian attacks. </p><p>I think those are all useful things because that keeps the flow of commerce through the region, moving through the Strait of Hormuz. We've reopened the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait recently. I believe commerce is eventually going to flow again, though that's going to take a little time as insurance companies test the waters about what the Houthis are going to be willing to do. But all of those things are very much in our national interest.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>Let's talk about the vulnerability of some of those forces. You've had all those forces under your command. How difficult a task is it to go from whatever the baseline force protection is to us now attacking the nation of Iran? What's the ramp up like in terms of security?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>General McKenzie:</em></strong></em> We have exquisitely rehearsed and prepared plans to protect our forces. As the CENTCOM commander, you begin every day worrying about the force protection level of U.S. forces in the region, our embassies in the region, our American citizens in the region, as well as our friends and partners. So you look at that every day and you balance it against what the Iranians are doing. We have very good ways of knowing what the Iranians are thinking about and what they plan to do. So as we saw recently, we are typically able to adjust and prepare for that. The risk is always that you'll get it wrong or they'll get lucky, and we know and understand that. But we work very closely with forces in the region to ensure they're prepared for these types of things. It's a battle drill. It is an onerous thing to do. You're leaving the comfortable places you live. You're going to places that are certainly less comfortable, albeit for a short period of time, but it's one of the best ways we can effectively save the Iranians from themselves. If they were to attack us and cause significant U.S. casualties, then the potential for upward escalation is very high. We always say the Iranians own the lower steps on the escalation ladder. We own all the higher steps on the escalation ladder.

You may not need as much as you've got right now. You need the ability to flow them back in very quickly if you elect to pull forces out. But what we have right now is an Iran that is effectively deterred. They chose not to launch a massive attack on us. Instead, they launched a very choreographed attack, and if we're to believe reporting, that was telegraphed well in advance because they did not want to get into significant combat with the United States \u2014 because they know and understand our capabilities. That's what these forces bring. To draw down precipitously would possibly undo that deterrent effect.</p><p>On the other hand, and this is something that really only the president of the United States can balance, he's a president who has struck Iran twice \u2014 [Quds Force Commander, General] <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/avenging-the-death-of-qassem-soleimani\" target=\"_self\"><u>Qassem Soleimani</u></a> back in 2020, and now this most recent attack.

I do know that we and Israel both share the same objective with Iran. We don't want them to have a nuclear weapon, and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of discussion on that, a lot of assessment. How effective were the strikes? Where are we? What needs to be done? I would assume they're going to spend a fair amount of time talking about that. But I would also say the same thing I said about President Trump and Iran. That same credibility probably extends to his relationship with Israel and the way going forward.

The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>\u201cIt certainly serves our interest to maintain a presence in the region,\u201d Gen. McKenzie said. \u201cAnd it certainly serves the interests of the Gulf states and other states as well that we be there in order to give them additional stability as they confront the threat from Iran.\u201d</p><p>The focus on the U.S. presence in the Middle East comes early on in an administration that has indicated it may want to pivot from a focus on the region and shift attention toward Asia. But testifying just prior to the U.S. attack in Iran, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, who was <a href=\"https://defensescoop.com/2025/06/30/combatant-commanders-centcom-eucom-brad-cooper-alexus-grynkewich/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed just this week</a> as the new CENTCOM commander, said he sees no reason to draw down now. </p><p>\u201cOur approach today is to assess and move forward on a conditions-based assessment,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he told</a> the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cI think, given the dynamic nature of what's happening today, that assessment in the future could look different than it does today, perhaps, and if confirmed, I'm committed into my tenure to continue to assess what our posture needs to look like and make recommendations.\u201d</p><p><strong>What are U.S. Troops Doing There</strong></p><p>For decades, the United States has kept tens of thousands of military personnel in the Middle East, spread across bases from Syria to the Persian Gulf. </p><p>Among the largest are the <a href=\"https://greydynamics.com/al-udeid-air-base-the-largest-us-military-installation-in-middle-east/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Al -Udeid Air Base</a> in Qatar, home to the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing and the forward headquarters of CENTCOM \u2013 with some 10,000 troops \u2013 and the U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet base <a href=\"https://installations.militaryonesource.mil/in-depth-overview/naval-support-activity-bahrain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in Bahrain</a>, where 9,000 Americans are deployed. 13,500 U.S. service members are stationed at <a href=\"http://v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bases in Kuwait</a> and another 5,000 in the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/12/mapping-us-troops-and-military-bases-in-the-middle-east\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">United Arab Emirates (UAE).</a> Maritime deployments that followed the Hamas massacre in Israel on October 7, 2023, added a few thousand troops to the overall number. Finally, roughly 3,000 Americans are stationed at bases in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/after-iran-proxy-strikes-should-u-s-troops-leave-iraq-and-syria\" target=\"_self\">Iraq and Syria,</a> vestiges of the anti-ISIS operations that were carried out a decade ago. </p><p>Proponents of the current force posture see a smart distribution of troops that matches U.S. interests and furthers several key missions: the ability to respond quickly to crises; countering the Iranian threat; bolstering the defense of Israel; helping secure maritime commerce in the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz; maintaining U.S. relations with key Gulf allies; and ensuring that ISIS and other groups do not reconstitute themselves and threaten U.S. interests. </p><p>\u201cThere are multiple missions at play,\u201d Cohen said, beyond the current operations against Iran. \u201cSome of this is a legacy of the global war on terrorism. We have soldiers in Syria and Iraq, doing primarily counter-ISIS missions, some stabilization missions as well. But we also have the major air bases in Bahrain for the Air Force and the Navy, managing air operations and the naval forces in the region. And what that means in practice, is we are concerned about the free flow of commerce through places like the Strait of Hormuz, and making sure that the Houthis don\u2019t interfere with global maritime traffic there as well.\u201d </p><p>Those arguing for a drawdown say that a force of 40,000 is far too costly, and that the stated missions are either outdated or could be accomplished with a much smaller number of troops. </p><p>\u201cMy longer-term view \u2013 even before the Iran strike \u2013 of the forces in the Middle East has been that when you have 40,000 forces in a region, anything that happens in that region implicates the United States, even things that actually aren't in U.S. interests,\u201d Kavanagh, the Defense Priorities director, told <em>The Cipher Brief.</em></p><p>\u201cTo the extent that we can get those forces out and limit unnecessary entanglements, I think that would be a smart move,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that doesn't necessarily mean that you could never operate in the Middle East if there were actually a threat. Air power and naval power is something that's very mobile, and if you had the support of the Gulf countries, you could operate from those bases again.\u201d</p><p><strong>The war against ISIS</strong></p><p>Officially, U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria serve as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, which began as a U.S.-led coalition in 2014 to dismantle the Islamic State (ISIS). Although that campaign was declared a success in Iraq (in 2017) and in Syria (2019), the U.S. maintains nearly 3,500 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/24/us-troops-attacked-syria-iraq-israel-hamas-gaza/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">troops</a> in the two countries. </p><p>Those bases are also considered the most vulnerable to outside attack, and well before the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes against Iran, analysts and policymakers were questioning the wisdom of keeping them there.</p><p>After Israel launched its war on Hamas in October 2023, these bases \u2013 along with a smaller outpost in Jordan \u2013 were attacked hundreds of times by rocket strikes that reportedly caused <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/40-us-service-members-may-brain-injuries-iran-linked-attacks-rcna123591\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dozens</a> of traumatic brain injuries among U.S. troops. In January 2024, three Americans <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/tower-22-and-the-path-to-a-wider-war\" target=\"_self\">were killed</a> and dozens were injured at the small \u201cTower 22\u201d base in Jordan. As <em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/tower-22-and-the-path-to-a-wider-war\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a></em> reported then, the deadly strike prompted calls for ending the Iraq and Syria deployments.</p><p>Bernard Hudson, a former director of counterterrorism at the CIA, told us then that U.S. troops in those countries were \u201cfolks in harm\u2019s way who can\u2019t be protected and are surrounded by Iranian elements in both countries.\u201d </p><p>Today, the case for staying in Syria and Iraq imagines a different nightmare: the Americans leave, and conditions are restored for a resurgent ISIS that could do more damage in the region and beyond. </p><p>\u201cI would argue that the fight against ISIS still goes on,\u201d Gen. McKenzie said. \u201cWe don't actually do that fight ourselves, but we do support our partners both in Iraq and in Syria who continue to conduct operations against ISIS, which is now newly flourishing based on the turmoil in Syria.\u201d </p><p>Cohen concurred. \u201cISIS is beaten down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not gone, though. And the concern is if you begin to take forces away, ISIS will sprout back up. There are also concerns that if we pull out, particularly out of Syria, we will risk abandoning the Kurds, who've been a long-time partner. So, there's an argument for keeping troops there for a host of both counterterrorism reasons, but also for regional stability issues.\u201d</p><p>Kavanagh countered that the threat to the U.S. was minimal, and not worth the investment in U.S. military force. </p><p>\u201cISIS is not a threat to the United States \u2013 at least not the ISIS that's operating in the Middle East,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people argue that ISIS-K is becoming a more global threat, but they're not in Iraq and Syria. And our intelligence community has been very effective at uncovering plots before they happen. So, I'm not convinced that you need a military presence to protect the United States from that threat.\u201d</p><p>The Defense Department has been conducting a \u201cposture review\u201d of the Iraq and Syria deployments for more than a year. The Iraq Higher Military Commission, which was tasked with preparing a U.S. withdrawal plan from that country, hasn\u2019t met since September, <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">according to <em>Defense One</em>.</a> Recently, Maine Senator Angus King returned from a visit to Iraq and said that officials there had asked for the American troops to remain. </p><p>\u201cThey have an election coming up this fall, and that's been one of the significant dangers,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/06/middle-east-unrest-drives-conversation-us-troop-presence/406281/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sen. King said</a>, referring to potential threats from Iran-backed militias in Iraq. \u201cIt seems to me, given the renewed volatility\u2026it\u2019s not a good time to be drawing down our forces, because they are viewed as stabilizing forces in all of those countries in the Middle East.\u201c</p><p><strong>A rapid-reaction force \u2013 and the costs</strong></p><p>Many experts say that the brief war with Iran \u2013 and the tensions that linger in its aftermath \u2013 are only the latest examples of a longstanding reality: crises in the Middle East come with regularity. And that, they say, is reason enough for maintaining the American air and naval bases in the Gulf states. </p><p>Proponents of the U.S. posture also note that those Gulf allies want the Americans there. The U.S. has mutual defense agreements and commitments with Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain. An abrupt exit, they argue, could undermine relationships with those countries.</p><p>\u201cThere's a geopolitical bent here in that the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, they all value having a U.S. presence in the region,\u201d Jason Campbell, Senior Fellow at the Middle East Institute, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cIt provides them both a certain level of added security from Iran, as well as additional access for their respective militaries to training and certain types of equipment that are of use to them. So, there are both security and geopolitical reasons for the presence in this part of the world.\u201d</p><p>Detractors point to the costs \u2013 particularly of the larger bases in the Gulf. Sustaining U.S. forces in the Middle East is expensive, north of <a href=\"https://reason.com/2024/10/08/a-year-of-war-in-the-middle-east-cost-americans-nearly-23-billion/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">$20 billion</a> per year. Kavanagh and Caldwell argue that U.S. personnel in the region require more extensive defenses than those based at home, including hardened facilities and advanced air defenses, to protect them from Iranian-backed drone and missile attacks. </p><p>Meanwhile, each uptick in tensions has meant shifts to a high-alert status that carry their own costs. When the U.S. made the decision to strike Iran, most of the aircraft at the al-Udeid base in Qatar were moved out, and ships stationed at the U.S. naval base in Bahrain were sent out to sea as a security precaution. </p><p>\u201cThere is a heightened level of threat there,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThey'll move some of their naval ships out of Bahrain and out to sea to keep them safer\u2026These are typical things we see, leading up to and enduring periods of tension in the region.\u201d</p><p>Ultimately, none of those measures mattered much in the recent war; the Iranians were clearly not interested in escalation, and their public retaliation \u2013 for now at least \u2013 has been limited to a single well-telegraphed strike against the Al-Udeid base, which President Trump said had come with advance warning.</p><p>But Caldwell and Kavanagh argue that the costs and the vulnerability of these bases alone make the case for a drawdown, or at least a consolidation of U.S. forces in the region to one or two locations. </p><p>\u201cThe \u201812-Day War\u2019 fortunately did not cost any American lives,\u201d Caldwell and Kavanagh <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/28/iran-strike-american-military-vulnerability/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> in the Post, \u201cbut it highlighted our vulnerabilities in the region and underlined how our existing force posture was superfluous to achieving our aims. The war\u2019s end provides an opportunity for the United States to do what it has tried and failed to do for the better part of a decade: rationalize and downscale its presence in the Middle East.\u201d</p><p><strong>What comes next</strong> </p><p>All the past calls for a drawdown of American military power in the region ultimately ran into the same roadblock: It\u2019s hard to disengage from the Middle East. </p><p>President Donald Trump ran for a second term on a foreign policy platform that would decrease American involvement in the Middle East and pivot towards growing challenges in the Indo-Pacific. He referred to himself as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/10/trump-war-israel-gaza-ukraine-yemen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\u201ccandidate of peace,\u201d</a> with promises to extricate the U.S. from entanglements in the region. He may still do so; but like many of his predecessors, he has found it difficult to stay out of the region\u2019s turbulence.</p><p>\u201cI'm optimistic that once things stabilize, at least some of the air and naval power will move out of the region, because I do think there are strong voices in the Pentagon and elsewhere who really would like to concentrate more on Asia,\u201d Kavanagh said. \u201cAnd you can't do that when all your air and naval assets are tied up in the Middle East.\u201d</p><p>Even those experts who support the deployments say they welcome the discussions about their future.</p><p>\u201cThere's certainly debate to be had for the number of installations required,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHow many forces should indeed be there and what specific purpose should they serve? I think those are all fair questions, but again, the geopolitical costs of removing forces completely from the region could be higher than many realize.\u201d</p><p>Campbell added that a complete damage assessment of the strikes against Iran \u2013 which is not yet complete \u2013 will likely dictate the way forward, and that until then, there is a \u201cnear-to middle-term utility of having forces and resources in the region just from a more operational standpoint.\u201d</p><p>Cohen agrees, noting that despite Trump\u2019s claim that the nuclear sites in Iran had been \u201cobliterated,\u201d questions remain about the damage done and what may come next. </p><p>\u201cThere's an open question about how much destruction we actually did to the nuclear program with that strike,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAnd if you were to have a more sustained [U.S.] offensive, and if you actually wanted to do something somewhat larger that would actually have potentially a more permanent effect, you would need a bigger operation.\u201d And that, he said, would surely involve the American bases in the Gulf.</p><p>Gen. McKenzie, the former CENTCOM commander, said he welcomes the coming \u201cposture review,\u201d and the overall debate about U.S. forces in the Middle East. </p><p>\u201cThat's a national policy decision that we're going to have to make,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much do we want to leave in there? It's a careful calibration. You may not need as much as you've got right now, but you need the ability to flow them back in very quickly if you elect to pull forces out.\u201d</p><p>Ultimately, he said, \u201cWe could leave the region, we could certainly do that, and that's talked about fairly frequently.\u201d But he added that in the short term, that would hurt the U.S. deterrent effect against Iran, the ability to secure safe maritime commerce, and the relationship with those Gulf allies. </p><p>\u201cI think that's the thing to cover when we look at why are our forces there, what effects do they give, what effects do we derive from the fact that they're there \u2013 I think those are all useful things. All of those things are very much in our national interest.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

    "description": "<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><em>\u201cThe protagonists of 1914 were sleepwalkers, watchful but unseeing, haunted by dreams, </em></em><em><em>yet blind to the reality of the horror they were about to bring into the world.\u201d</em></em></p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>C.Clark, </strong>\u2018\u2019The Sleepwalkers: How Europe went to war in 1914\u201d</p><p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>This article is a homage to the aforecited Christopher Clark\u2019s seminal work, where he meticulously details how Europe\u2019s leaders, blinded by their own complex, interlocking alliances, and convoluted diplomatic manoeuvres, stumbled into the catastrophic Great War of 1914.</p><p>This article is also a mirror for present-day leaders and decision makers, offering a disturbing reflection of morbidly similar, if not at all the same, pre-war developments, attitudes, and sentiments, that have once again led the West to a precipice, this time \u2013 with Russia.</p><p>Finally, this article is both a wake-up call and a final announcement for those, who still hesitate and doubt that \u201cour Europe is mortal, it can die\u201d, as Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, put it in his speech last year on April 24 at the Sorbonne University.</p><p><strong>Don\u2019t look around!</strong></p><p>In 2006, when a former FSB officer and critic of Putin, Alexander Litvinenko, was poisoned with Polonium-210 on British soil, there were very few doubts as to who was behind the attack. Litvinenko\u2019s resulting death from acute radiation syndrome significantly strained relations between the UK and Russia, leading to diplomatic expulsions and increased scrutiny of Russian activities in the UK.</p><p>As much as this event became pivotal in the relationships between London and Moscow and called for a major reassessment of the Kremlin\u2019s intentions and capabilities on European soil, it was still regarded by the rest of Europe mostly as a matter of Russia\u2019s internal issues \u2014 Litvinenko was Russian, he ardently criticised the Russian leadership and he was a high-ranking defector. Therefore, he was targeted by the Russian special services. The consensus in the West was that Russia targeted its own renegade citizens, and not citizens from European countries.</p><p>This proved to be a rather comfortable position for the political leadership of the EU at that time (primarily German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy), which was in the middle of exploring deeper economic ties and a more intertwined commerce with Russia.</p><p>This position allowed the economic and political powerhouses of Europe to safely qualify Moscow\u2019s explicitly hostile actions around the same time towards countries like Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Georgia as mere quarrels between the former Soviet republics. The Kremlin\u2019s distribution of Russian passports in Latvia in 2004; the Kremlin\u2019s blockade of rail and ports and manipulation of theDruzhba pipeline oil supply in retaliation for losing the bid for Lithuania\u2019s only oil refinery Ma\u017eeiki\u0173 Nafta; or Russia\u2019s complete ban of imports of Georgian wines as a punishment for Tbilisi\u2019s pro-Western stance in 2006 \u2013 all these events were disregarded as merely regional tensions between the former USSR cohabitants.</p><p>The Swedish airspace incursion that happened the same year, when a Russian military aircraft without active transponders flew simulated attack runs near Gotland, didn\u2019t match this story, but was mainly ignored as an unfortunate mistake in the then non-NATO sky.</p><p>In 2007, when the websites of Estonia\u2019s government, parliament, banks, ministries, newspapers, and broadcasters websites faced the most massive cyber-attack in history, which coincided with a dispute with Russia over the relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, a Soviet-era monument paramount for the Kremlin\u2019s WW2 mythology, the same whispering was heard in EU high cabinets \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a matter of Russia\u2019s backyard\u201d. Nobody would dare to openly call an independent EU state \u201cRussia\u2019s backyard\u201d, but the reaction towards this incident, widely considered the first major state-on-state cyberattack, was telltale.</p><p>The same year, Putin gave his notorious \u2018Munich speech\u2019 \u2014\u2018\u2019The speech in which Putin has told us who he was\u201d, as<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/18/putin-speech-wake-up-call-post-cold-war-order-liberal-2007-00009918\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Politico has put it</u></a>. Among his disturbing and grim messages, one was particularly ominous: \u2018Whether we should be indifferent and aloof to various internal conflicts inside [other] countries? Of course not.\u2019</p><p>This message didn\u2019t take long to materialize. In 2008 Russia invaded Georgia under the pretext of protecting Russian citizens and peacekeepers in the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. This was the climax of the \u201cRussia\u2019s backyard\u201d attitude. Numerous former members of Mikheil Saakashvili\u2019s team, the then-president of Georgia, said that in private conversations with Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel, Condoleezza Rice and their teams, these foreign leaders and their advisors articulated the futility of resistance and the need to accept the reality imposed by the Kremlin. \u201cAccepting this reality\u201d would mean recognizing that Russia does indeed hold a claim on Georgia, which naturally derives from the common soviet history. (Later in 2014 some representatives of the EU behind closed doors were promoting the same thought regarding Crimea).</p><p>Unfortunately, these and many other hostile actions failed to seriously alarm both the American and European political elites of that period, who were seriously engaged in a \u201cRussian reset\u201d. In 2009 Russian military aircraft again violated Swedish airspace, Moscow cut off gas supplies to Ukraine in the dead of winter (affecting also European countries dependent on gas transiting through Ukraine), and Kremlin-backed hackers attacked the German government.</p><p>In the 2010s Russia, either directly or through its proxies, effectuated cyber attacks on the German and Finnish governments, as well as on energy distribution networks in Sweden; sabotaged arms depots in Czechia; stirred up ethnic tensions in Germany with the \u2018Lisa Case\u2019; hacked TV5Monde and manipulated social media to encourage chaos during Yellow Vests protests in France; infiltrated the Aviation Sector and the Spiez laboratory in Switzerland; attempted to assassinate an arms dealer in Bulgaria; and targeted US and Canada diplomats in Cuba and later in other countries (the \u2018Cuba syndrome\u2019).</p><p>Moscow supported anti-fracking movements in Romania to prevent it from developing its own natural gas resources; attempted a coup in Montenegro; jammed Finland\u2019s and Norway\u2019s GPS signals; backed the hacking of the World Anti-Doping Agency; and attempted to sabotage the global internet infrastructure by exploring vulnerabilities in undersea Internet cables connecting Europe and North America.</p><p>Closer to the 2020s Russian operatives attempted to intercept secure military communications from a French military satellite; the Kremlin imposed trade restrictions on Moldovan agricultural products and manipulated energy prices in response to Kishinev\u2019s increased engagement with the EU; and Moscow manipulated the energy market in Bulgaria by restricting gas supplies.</p><p>Russia systematically meddled in top tier popular voting across the globe, with the following being subjects of major investigations for alleged Russian interference: the 2016 UK Brexit referendum, 2016 US presidential elections, 2017 French presidential elections, 2017 German federal elections, 2018 Finnish presidential elections and the 2019 European parliament elections.</p><p>The amount of money and effort spent by the Kremlin to fund and cultivate separatist, xenophobic, anti-Western, Eurosceptic, anti-Americanist, radical, extreme and divisive parties, movements, groups and organizations across the Transatlantic community since Putin came to power is overwhelming.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Apply for a seat at the table today.</em></strong></em></u></a></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>The impenetrable depth of peace</strong></p><p>It looked like all these events were mainly ignored in the West, disregarded as something accidental, if not marginal, which hardly meant anything within the context of the long and deep peace that Europe had seen since the end of WWII.</p><p>Appearing initially as a bitter reminder of the brutality of war, the 8th of May slogan \u201cNever again\u201d has evolved over decades from a yearly admonishment of human tragedies to a concept that was to be enforced literally. For any war to be \u201cnever again\u201d meant that peace must be \u201cforever\u201d. Hence, attaining peace morphed from a righteous and pragmatic complex objective into a quasi-religious ideology that rejects the mere plausibility of conflict \u2013 \u201ca deep peace\u201d.</p><p>A \"Deep peace\" is not merely a state of prolonged absence of war. The doctrine posits that the very discussion of potential martial threats or military readiness could, paradoxically, invoke the specter of war itself. This ideology has been perpetuated by a sustained period of peace which, rather than being seen as a delicate, demanding and maintained state, is viewed as a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>This means that for \u2018peacewalkers\u2019, the modern-day political apostles of this new security cult, peace is self-reinforcing. The longer they can keep the peace, the stronger on their opinion it gets, and the less probable war is. Hence the obsession with preserving peace at all costs, even if such costs are clearly whetting the appetite of the predator, who never really bothered to camouflage his hostile intentions. This almost irrational refusal to accept any possibility of another conflict on the continent, as if it were a fantasy, a fairytale, a myth, has been ruling out the very discussion of the flaws of current peace and its disproportions, as these very discussions were believed to invite war.</p><p>It seems that only at the Munich Security Conference of 2025 western leaders finally realized that war is now not just at their doorstep \u2013 it has already rung the bell.</p><p>This state of \u201cdeep peace\u201d is precisely the reason why all the signals of hostility from Russia have been ignored by the peacewalkers. This was seen in the reaction of the major western governments\u2019 defence budgets to the overt military interventions conducted by Russia in Georgia, in the Middle East and in Ukraine before 2022\u2014the increase of defense spending was literally marginal.</p><p>Both European and American defense spending remained disproportionately low. The European Union's defense budget gradually declined from 4% of GDP in 1960 to a historic low of 1.3% of GDP in 2014. It wasn't until 2020 that European defense spending saw a \u201cnoticeable\u201d increase of 0.3% - up to 1.6% of GDP.</p><p>A similar trend was observed in the United States, where defense spending as a share of GDP stagnated and mostly declined throughout the 2010s, following the peak of the War on Terror. U.S. military expenditure steadily fell from around 4.5% of GDP in 2010 to 3.2% by 2017, even as Russia ramped up its global assertiveness under Putin\u2019s second presidency. It wasn\u2019t until 2020 that U.S. defense spending rebounded to 3.7%, reflecting a shift in priorities as geopolitical tensions escalated.</p><p>The fact that both European and American defense spending remained stagnant for most of the 2010s, suggests that the West did not perceive even Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine as a serious enough threat to warrant an immediate military buildup. This delayed response underscores the extent to which policymakers in both Europe and the U.S. underestimated the long-term implications of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas, as much as Russia being a direct threat.</p><p>Once again, the pervasive\u2014almost sacrosanct\u2014belief in the enduring power of 'deep peace' has led to the deliberate overlooking of clear signals of impending conflict. This illusion of unassailable peace, fostered by decades of relative stability and economic interdependence, has engendered a dangerous complacency among western, but mainly European, nations.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em>Sign up today</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em>.</em></strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><strong>False Idols</strong></p><p>In order to start thinking about how to fix this situation, we first need to understand how we got here. What beliefs guided decision makers? Within what ideological framework did they operate?</p><p>The first reference point is the perception of national security through the lens of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</p><p>The evolution of the role and, more importantly, the capabilities of NATO in the minds of its members happened under the influence of a prolonged peace on the European continent, with some successful military interventions of its members in the 1990s and 2010s, as well as of a certain image of a hi-tech undefeatable army produced by American pop-culture.</p><p>As a result, NATO has become more of a religious icon, rather than a real military force. The belief in NATO\u2019s capacity has become unconditional and it has fastened the religion of \u201cdeep peace\u201d (which is indeed very similar to a religion because of its irrationality), by providing an image of an almighty protector, which will always intervene in case of trouble.</p><p>The truth is, however, a bit different. While NATO might have proven itself successful in regional conflicts like Yugoslavia or the Middle East, it was never ready to face a full-scale war with a proper adversary like Russia or China. It was even less prepared to face hybrid warfare, with war being waged not only with bombs and bullets, but with information and narratives.</p><p>The reliance on nuclear power was paramount in NATO\u2019s deterrence strategy. The war Russia has launched against Ukraine, however, has shown that nuclear weapons deter only the use of other nuclear weapons \u2013 not conventional ones. </p><p>One might argue that the aggression against Ukraine is very different from a hypothetical aggression against NATO, and if Russia were to invade a member of the Treaty the retaliation would be dramatically different. Perhaps. How can, however, the nuclear arsenal defend even member countries against \u2018the green men\u2019, the scam referendums, the total blackouts due to cyber-attacks, the skirmishes with emigrants along the borders, arson of ammunition stores and further hybrid tactics? This begs a clear answer.</p><p>Therefore, a NATO membership can hardly serve as a justification for not having a powerful military able to defend one\u2019s country against an invasion. This, however, was precisely the belief of the \u2018peacewalkers\u2019 for decades: \u2018NATO will take care of us, and it has nukes. We\u2019re safe\u2019.</p><p>Russia has proved them wrong. And now the new White House administration is considering a major NATO policy shift, where the U.S. might not defend a fellow NATO member that is attacked, if the country doesn\u2019t meet the defense spending threshold. Given the alternative view on global security the new U.S. leadership has taken, the moment Washington refuses to invoke Article 5 following a hypothetical encroachment on a member-state \u2013 the world as we know it is finished.</p><p>Another belief where Russia has proved everyone wrong is the na\u00efve idea that it can be deterred by trade. And yet, even the current U.S. administration seems to be falling into this trap once again.</p><p>This illusion has deep roots. Since the early 2000s, the dominant Western orthodoxy held that deeper trade and economic interdependence with Russia would tame its aggressive instincts and gradually bind it to the liberal international order. From Germany\u2019s embrace of <em><em>Wandel durch Handel</em></em> to the U.S. push for Russia\u2019s WTO accession in 2012, the assumption was always the same: prosperity would soften Moscow, and mutual gain would deter aggression.</p><p>It did the opposite.</p><p>The trick is that the fruits and benefits of trade relations are used very differently in democracies and autocracies. While democracies invest the spoils of trade into raising the quality of life of their citizens\u2014because that is the social contract at the heart of their legitimacy\u2014autocratic regimes like Russia spend those same profits on the <em><em>quality of oppression</em></em>: strengthening their propaganda machines and expanding the coercive reach of their security services. These are the twin pillars of modern authoritarian rule.</p><p>In the 2000s, as Russia reaped massive windfalls from energy exports, it poured resources into rebuilding and modernizing its military. Military spending jumped from just $9 billion in 2000 to over $60 billion by 2014. At the same time, Putin\u2019s regime systematically increased funding for the security services and domestic repression apparatus. By 2025, Russia will allocate a staggering 6.3% of its GDP\u2014over $145 billion\u2014to defense, surpassing even Cold War-era levels. In parallel, the budget for internal security, which includes the FSB and National Guard, accounts for over 10% of the federal budget, while state propaganda organs like RT and VGTRK are receiving $1.4 billion annually, an increase of 13% over the previous year.</p><p>Meanwhile, spending on social programs in Russia is projected to fall by 16% in 2025. The regime is not interested in improving the lives of its citizens\u2014it is interested in controlling them.</p><p>Hence, while Russia has been methodically preparing for war, both externally and internally, the West spent the same decades investing in the illusion of a deepening peace. Defense budgets shrank, armies were downsized, and strategic industries were allowed to atrophy. Europe, in particular, funneled billions into Russian energy infrastructure like Nord Stream, while simultaneously allowing itself to become strategically dependent on the very regime it hoped to pacify.</p><p>In the end, the West was trading with Russia under the illusion that it was exporting stability. In reality, it was importing vulnerability.</p><p><strong>Epilogue: the trench of the Saints</strong></p><p>In the end, however, it is not doctrines, nukes, trade or alliances that hold the gates. It is the trench of the saints\u2014where exhausted, ordinary Ukrainians still stand between us and the abyss. </p><p>And yet, instead of standing behind them as one would behind the gates of a besieged city, much of the West regards their resistance with fatigue, irritation, even suspicion\u2014treating Ukraine not as a rampart, but as a liability. The war, they whisper, drags on. The costs are too high. Perhaps it\u2019s time to talk peace, meaning: surrender something, accept something, pretend that nothing essential is lost.</p><p>But what is being lost is everything.</p><p>The trench of the Ukrainian soldier is not only a physical line against Russian advance. It is the symbolic front line of a deeper war\u2014between freedom and tyranny, law and brute force, future and regression. Just as in the 20th century, when the free world had to rally to crush the Nazi regime not with half-measures but with full moral clarity, so too must the West now realize: Ukraine is not the cause of this war\u2019s duration. Ukraine is the reason we still have time.</p><p>If we abandon that trench\u2014or fail to fully support it\u2014we are not avoiding war. We are inviting a greater one.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><em>\u201cOn both sides they imagined that \u2018bluffing\u2019 would suffice to achieve success.

But Musk and his companies still hired more lobbyists this year than any other since 2021, according to data from the Texas Ethics Commission. </p>\n\n<p>Musk, the billionaire businessman behind carmaker Tesla and aerospace company SpaceX, influenced several new Texas laws this year. How his lobbyists came about these wins, however, is more of a mystery.</p>\n\n<p>His lobbyists, who represented Tesla, SpaceX and the social media giant X Corp., spent tens of thousands of dollars on things like gifts and meals for Texas elected officials and others during the session, according to an analysis of state ethics data. In most cases, Texas transparency laws do not require lobbyists to disclose which politicians they wined and dined or on behalf of which clients.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>The Texas Newsroom reached out to all 12 of Musk\u2019s lobbyists registered with the state this session. Only one, Carrie Simmons, a lobbyist who counts Tesla among her clients, responded, but she declined to be interviewed. She said only Musk\u2019s companies could comment on their work this session. </p>\n\n<p>Emails sent to Musk\u2019s companies and to Musk himself were not returned. </p>\n\n<p>The Texas Newsroom was able to find hints of some of their actions in records obtained from Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and state Sen. Adam Hinojosa. Other documents detailing their deeper connections are hidden from disclosure by state laws.</p>\n\n<p>Ethics experts said the responsibility to improve transparency lies with Texas lawmakers. State law provides a \u201cbase level of transparency\u201d for the public on who lobbyists are and who they represent, said Andrew Cates, a former lobbyist who wrote a guide on state ethics rules. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cBeyond that, the Legislature simply has not prioritized enough transparency in how the dollars are actually being spent on legislators on a regular basis. But that\u2019s not the lobby\u2019s fault, it\u2019s the Legislature\u2019s,\u201d Cates said. </p>\n\n<p>Tom Forbes, president of the Professional Advocacy Association of Texas, a statewide lobbyist organization, said while lobbyists sometimes get a bad rap, they play a critical role for lawmakers trying to make decisions on complex policies. He told The Texas Newsroom that his group is \u201cagnostic\u201d about making reporting requirements more stringent but will follow any changes the state implements. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur association is going to comply with whatever law the Legislature passes,\u201d Forbes said.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        Who did Musk hire and who did they lobby?\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Eight of Musk\u2019s lobbyists worked for SpaceX, according to filings with the Ethics Commission. Tesla had four, one of whom also worked for X.</p>\n\n<p>Musk\u2019s lobbyists include former advisers and staffers for Gov. Greg Abbott, among them Mike Toomey and Reed Clay. Another lobbyist, Will McAdams, once sat on the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which regulates the state\u2019s electric, telecommunications, and water and sewer utilities.</p>\n\n<p>All but one lobbyist had other clients for whom they were also working, making it more difficult to track exactly how much spending went to further Musk\u2019s agenda. Benjamin Lancaster, a former legislative staffer, was only on SpaceX\u2019s payroll.</p>\n\n<p>Lobbyists are not required to report their exact salaries, only a pay range. According to Ethics Commission data, Musk pledged to pay somewhere between about $400,000 to nearly $1 million in total to his lobbyists for their work this year. Half of them could rake in more than $110,000 each working for Musk\u2019s companies.</p>\n\n<p>Each month, lobbyists report their total spending. But state rules don\u2019t require them to disclose who was on the receiving end unless the lobbyist shelled out more than $132.60 on one person in a single day. This includes food and beverages, transportation, lodging or entertainment. Taxes and tips are not counted. The disclosure threshold for gifts is $110.</p>\n\n<p>Lobbyists also don\u2019t need to disclose exactly who attended events to which all legislators were invited, like catered lunches for the entire Texas House of Representatives or happy hours hosted off-site.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, these rules mean a lobbyist could buy the same elected official a steak dinner every night. As long as the daily cost stays under that amount, they don\u2019t need to say who got the free meal.</p>\n\n<p>Musk\u2019s lobbyists spent more than $46,000 on food and drink alone for elected officials and their staff, family and guests this year, according to state ethics records. None of them detailed which elected officials may have been on the receiving end, implying all of their spending remained beneath the daily threshold.</p>\n\n<p>Jim Clancy, the former chair of the Ethics Commission, said it\u2019s common for multiple lobbyists to divide a single bill in order to stay below the reporting threshold. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey have 15 different credit cards in the deal to make sure that it\u2019s all below the limit,\u201d Clancy told The Texas Newsroom. \u201cThe Legislature has to change it. And if they did, they wouldn\u2019t get to eat for free.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/28/texas-legislature-ethics-bills-campaign-lobbying/\">slate of ethics bills</a>, including several to require transparency into who funds mass text messages for political campaigns, failed to become law this year, according to The Texas Tribune. Meanwhile, legislators <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB2781\">approved a new law</a> that will reduce the fine for former lawmakers who engage in illegal lobbying activity.</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n    \n        What do other records show?\n    \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>While lobbyists are not required to disclose which bills they discuss in private meetings with officials and their staff, they must note their position if they choose to testify on a piece of legislation. This is how The Texas Newsroom identified the 13 bills on which Musk\u2019s lobbyists took a public stance. </p>\n\n<p>The Texas Newsroom was able to glean some additional insight on lobbyist influence from records received through public information requests.</p>\n\n<p>Calendars for Hinojosa, a newly elected South Texas Republican who authored multiple bills that would benefit SpaceX and other aerospace companies, showed he or his staff had meetings scheduled with lobbyists or representatives from Musk\u2019s rocket company at least three times in two months. Emails showed Patrick penned a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration supporting SpaceX\u2019s ability to increase the number of launches at its South Texas rocket site.</p>\n\n<p>Patrick was also invited to take a tour of the Tesla Gigafactory outside Austin, these records showed, but it\u2019s unclear if he went.</p>\n\n<p>Neither Hinojosa nor Patrick responded to requests for an interview.</p>\n\n<p>The Texas Senate declined to release other documents that could have shed light on how Musk\u2019s companies interacted with elected officials. In denying their release, Senate Secretary Patsy Spaw said communications between state lawmakers and Texas residents are \u201cconfidential by law.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The reason, she said, is \u201cto ensure the right of citizens of the state to petition their state government without fear of harassment, retaliation or public ridicule.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>This could include emails with lobbyists.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Lauren McGaughy is a journalist with <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/texasnewsroom\">The Texas Newsroom</a>, a collaboration among NPR and the public radio stations in Texas.

The designation is justified, given Iran\u2019s continued support of proxies and criminal organizations that kill and terrorize innocent people. That behavior continues today, with the government of Ali Hosseini Khamenei surveilling, harassing, and detaining thousands of Iranians for allegedly aiding Israel -- and offending the morality police, who enforce Iran\u2019s dress code for women.</p><p>The U.S. \u2013 Israel bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites in Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow was more than justified. Iran was enriching uranium at 60% purity, a few weeks away from 90% purity for nuclear weapons. And given Iran\u2019s stated intent to destroy Israel, the bombing of these nuclear sites made imminent sense, especially given the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) recent report that Iran was concealing information on its nuclear program, to include weaponization.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

One of those officers was the visiting Director of the Office of Near East and South Asia Analysis, Robert C. Ames.</p><p>In October 1983, the Iranian government was found responsible for the Beirut barracks bombing by the Islamic Jihad Organization, which killed 241 U.S. service members, 58 French soldiers and 6 civilians, injuring 60. </p><p>These two terrorist bombings apparently emboldened Iran into thinking that terrorism can be effective in eroding U.S. resolve. Thus, Iran continued to support their proxies \u2013 Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen, and Shiite groups in Iraq and Syria \u2013 in its war with the U.S. and Israel.</p><p>In June 1996, Iran was behind the bombing of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 airmen and 498 U.S. and international military and civilian members injured. A U.S. court ruled that Iran \u2013 and its proxy Hezbollah Al-Hejaz -- was responsible for the attack, providing the funding, support and direction.</p><p>This was the very overt Iran, confident in perpetrating these bold acts of terrorism.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

This \u201cGreen Movement\u201d galvanized the Iranian people, resulting in protests, demonstrations and civil disobedience. The regime\u2019s response was predictable: using brutal force to suppress the demonstrations and arrest the protesters.</p><p>This has always been the regime\u2019s response to peaceful protests: suppressing and arresting the protesters. We saw this in September 2022 when Jina Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian -- died in police custody; arrested by the so-called morality policy for improperly wearing her Hijab headscarf. Eyewitnesses reported that Amini was severely beaten and died because of police brutality. </p><p>The Iranian people were irate with the brutal death of Amini. Protests erupted throughout Iran. Iran Human Rights reported that at least 476 people were killed by security forces. Amnesty International reported that Iranian security forces fired into groups with live ammunition and killed protesters by beating them with batons.</p><p>Amini\u2019s death gave rise to the global movement of: Woman, Life, Liberty.</p><p>The regime is now conducting a war against its own people, with widespread arrests of anyone protesting human rights abuses and corruption of the regime in power. </p><p>We would be remiss if we think the Ayatollah has given up on the use of terrorism to intimidate and deal with critics in opposition to his leadership. We would also be remiss if we think the theocracy will cease pursuing a nuclear weapons capability. The regime wants sanctions relief, and they\u2019re prepared to eschew nuclear weapons to get this relief. Eventually, however, they will pursue their nuclear weapons program. We should be prepared.</p><p><strong><em>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/1/irans-terror-legacy-ayatollahs-regime-still-poses-deadly-threat-us/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Times</a></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</em></strong></p><a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em></em></strong></em></u></a>",

Since we are <em>The Cipher Brief</em>, our favorites include not only thrillers and realistic, fast-paced novels \u2013 but some notable works of non-fiction on matters of national security, intelligence and foreign policy. And there\u2019s a cookbook thrown in for good measure.</p><p>We\u2019ve carefully combed through the books that we\u2019ve recently had reviewed by experts who have lived the spy or spy-related life - and we\u2019ve singled out some titles we think you might enjoy at the beach or wherever you\u2019re taking refuge from the summer heat. (<em>And just a note: if you do click and buy using links, we might make a small commission. At least enough to pay for the paper this was printed on.)</em></p><p>Let\u2019s get cooking, shall we?</p><p><strong>Cookbook / Whiskey Category</strong></p><p>Yep, you read that right. Leading our list of summer reads is one that has taken over the #1 spot in Amazon\u2019s whiskey and alcoholic spirits categories, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ZLkEJ4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Spy Walked Into A Bar: A Practitioner's Guide to Cocktail Tradecraft</a></em> by former senior CIA Officers Rob Dannenberg and Joseph P. Mullin Jr. Think of it as a real-life guide to spies and their favorite cocktails. Based on experiences from their clandestine operations backgrounds, Rob and Joe have collected, curated and perfected the cocktails that were enjoyed while celebrating milestone events during their CIA careers. From the drinks they ordered after successfully recruiting assets, to marking the end of a major operation, this book features real life stories and homegrown photos by the authors themselves. </p><p><strong>Novels</strong></p><p>Appropriate for summer, is a new spy novel from Tess Gerritsen, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3G5J0qp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Summer Guests: A Thriller</a></em>. This is Tess\u2019 second spy book, after her very successful TV series a few years ago called <em>Rizzoli and Isles</em>. Gerritsen <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-real-life-spy-coast\" target=\"_self\">talked</a> with Cipher Brief CEO & Publisher Suzanne Kelly about her journey from the popular TV series to spy author in the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-real-life-spy-coast\" target=\"_self\">Cover Stories podcast</a> \u2013 that was just after her first book, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/40wPPIc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Spy Coast</a> </em>was released. Veteran CIA officers Jay and Anne Gruner <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/martinis-and-murder-in-maine\" target=\"_self\">reviewed her latest book</a> about four retired CIA officers living in Maine. The Gruners tell us it is a \u201cgripping account of a complex set of murders, a possible recent kidnapping, and a secretary who was missing for 50 years.\u201d talking about her previous spy-themed book. </p><p>Former U.S. counterterrorism officer and cybersecurity executive Neal Pollard broke the code on Ken Dekleva\u2019s novel, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4nv3byF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Russian Diplomat\u2019s Wife</a></em>. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/i-spy-a-love-story\" target=\"_self\">In his review</a>, Neal says while the book ostensibly is a spy novel set in Vienna, it\u2019s really a love story between two spies. Author (and frequent Cipher Brief contributor) Dekleva draws on his experience as a psychiatrist working for the State Department in many of the locales central to the book and his understanding of human motivation seems to bring his stories to life. We know because we also interviewed the author for the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/the-russian-diplomats-wife\" target=\"_self\">Cover Stories Podcast.</a></p><p>Speaking of Dekleva, we tapped his expertise to review several books by other authors this year. One worthy of special mention is <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44HgTqG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Poet\u2019s Game: A Spy in Moscow</a></em> by Paul Vidich. Dekleva <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/paul-vidichs-moscow-get-off-the-x\" target=\"_self\">calls</a> the novel is a terrific read about a former CIA station chief in Moscow, now working as an investor in a private equity market in Moscow. The chief was called back to duty though to exfiltrate a former agent who claims to have explosive kompromat regarding America\u2019s president. Navigating between two perilous worlds, those of Moscow and Washington, the storyline seems to offer proof that the cold war never really ended.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em> </em></p><p>Going back even further in time, Dekleva also reviewed <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3GnrWw2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Assignment in Saigon: A Cold War Thriller</a></em> by former senior CIA officer Bill Rapp. In <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/bill-rapps-vietnam-a-different-kind-of-cold-war\" target=\"_self\">his review</a>, Dekleva says that to truly understand the intelligence war in Vietnam, fiction may offer more to the reader and Rapp\u2019s novel is a most worthy read.</p><p>Spy mastery is the theme of retired senior CIA officer Jim Lawler\u2019s latest novel, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44tlQSC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Traitors Tale: A Novel of Treachery within the CIA</a></em>. We turned to another seasoned Agency officer, and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/joseph-w-augustyn\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief expert</a>, Joe Augustyn, to <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/from-spy-master-to-story-teller\" target=\"_self\">review it</a>. Augustyn told us: \u201cJim Lawler has written an intriguing and captivating novel that should satisfy the appetite of any spy novel enthusiast. His character descriptions are impressive, his knowledge of the Agency, its bureaucracy and its inner workings is deep, and his operational savvy is on display throughout. Impressive too is his understanding of the dynamics of personal relationships, both professional and personal, which he calls the \u201cmetaphysics\u201d of spying.\u201d You can learn more about Lawler and his book from this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhEpYXdinnE&amp;t=5s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cover Stories Podcast interview</a>.</p><p><strong>Non- Fiction</strong></p><p>While we have reported on a ton of fine fiction over the past six months, real life stories, history and analysis have played an even larger role in our coverage. Among the books we\u2019d like to invite (or re-invite) to your attention here are: <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4ev0Qzu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Secret Servants of the Crown: The Forgotten Women of British Intelligence</a></em> by Claire Hubbard-Hall and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/neither-swallows-nor-amazons\" target=\"_self\">reviewed</a> for us by Cipher Brief expert <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/tim-willasey-wilsey\" target=\"_self\">Tim Willasey-Wilsey</a>, a real-life former member of the British Foreign Office. Willasey-Wilsey called it a \u201cmarvelous book and a valuable addition to what is known about the early days of the British secret services.\u201d We were lucky to have the author join us on a <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/secret-servants-of-the-crown\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief Cover Stories podcast</a> as well, describing the untold tales of women who silently served \u2013 including Katleen Pettigrew who was the inspiration for Ian Fleming\u2019s \u201cMiss Moneypenny\u201d in the James Bond novels.</p><p>For an American take on unsung women in intelligence, there is <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44sFiiG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Propaganda Girls: The Secret War of the Women of the OSS</a></em> by Lisa Rogak. The former director of the CIA\u2019s Office of Public Affairs, Tammy Kupperman Thorp <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/propaganda-girls-world-war-ii\" target=\"_self\">reviewed</a> the book that focuses on four women who played significant roles in the Office of Strategic Service (OSS) influence campaigns during World War II. She writes that women members of the OSS were in charge of \u201cblack propaganda\u201d primarily a \u201cseries of believable lies designed to cause the enemy soldiers to lose heart and ultimately surrender.\u201d </p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

For a fascinating look at that life, check out <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/400hOzY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Story of a CIA Wife: Married to the Craft</a></em> by Rosie Mowatt-Larssen. Veteran journalist and contributing Cipher Brief editor Elaine Shannon <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/a-cia-wifes-tale-of-slipping-kgb-tails-and-other-stories-from-the-cold\" target=\"_self\">reviewed that one</a> for us and lauds the author\u2019s \u201crazor wit\u201d and tales of life in numerous overseas posts including time in Moscow where she helped slip KGB tails, serviced dead drops and lived a life that at times was the stuff of spy thrillers. For more on Rosie \u2013 check out her interview with us for the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/story-of-a-cia-wife\" target=\"_self\">Cover Stories podcast</a>.</p><p>We also have several books about action in World War II that we\u2019d recommend. Let\u2019s start with <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4evexOX\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nothing But Courage: The 82nd Airborne\u2019s Daring D-Day Mission and Their Heroic Charge Across the La Fi\u00e8re Bridge</a></em> by James Donovan. We went to a subject matter expert <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/normandy-la-fiere\" target=\"_self\">to review</a> that one \u2013 retired Army Major General Jack Leide. The book tells of one of the most operationally important but lesser-known stories of World War II. Leide praised the author for providing \u201cincredibly insightful and intricate descriptions and actions of, not only the allied and German military forces arrayed against each other, but how the operation affected many of the local French residents and resistance forces as well.\u201d</p><p>For a far less heroic view of some of the events in that war, there is <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4la0aCs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Traitor of Arnhem: The Untold Story of WWII\u2019s Greatest Betrayal and the Moment that Changed History Forever</a></em> by Robert Verkaik. Recently declassified British MI-5 documents help animate this story of a strategic failure that delayed Allied victory in the war and came at a steep human cost. CIA veteran (and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/martin-petersen\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief expert</a>) Martin Peterson <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/martin-petersen\" target=\"_self\">reviewed the book</a> for us and writes that the author makes a strong circumstantial case that Anthony Blunt, one of Russia\u2019s British agents, played a vital role in passing intelligence to the Germans that damaged the Allies chances of success.</p><p>For a story about operational and intelligence success, there\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44Hi1uq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Taking Midway: Naval Warfare, Secret Codes and the Battle that Turned the Tide of World War II</a></em> by Martin Dugard. Had the Battle of Midway turned out differently, Hawaii and the west coast of the United States stood vulnerable to Japanese attack. The battle was won by the U.S. though through a combination of steely leadership by Admiral Chester Nimitz, and brilliant cryptological work led by a quirky Lieutenant Commander named Joe Rochefort. Normally, our go-to source for book reviewers are gray-haired subject matter experts. For this one, we tried something different and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/taking-a-look-at-the-battle-of-midway\" target=\"_self\">gave the mission to Jack Montgomery</a>, a U.S. Navy ensign currently serving on a Japan-based ship. Montgomery, whose master\u2019s degree thesis was on the Solomon Islands Campaign, notes that the author\u2019s writing style with short punchy sentences makes the book a quick, enjoyable and informative read. Dugard joined us for a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rJ9shOAFZCA?si=_IxSVx-Q3azttufC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cover Stories podcast</a> recently in which he explained how he developed his story-telling style and researched the book.</p><p>Another book sure to fascinate many Cipher Brief readers is <em><a href=\"file://The%20Determined%20Spy/%20The%20Turbulent%20Life%20and%20Times%20of%20CIA%20Pioneer%20Frank%20Wisner\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Determined Spy: The Turbulent Life and Times of CIA Pioneer Frank Wisner</a></em> by veteran journalist Doug Waller. Wisner\u2019s story sounds like fiction. Standout track star in college, lawyer, innovative leader in the OSS during World War II, one of the founders of the CIA, author of successful and unsuccessful covert actions, prominent player in the Georgetown social set \u2013 but victim of what would now be called bipolar disorder \u2013 an illness that eventually led to his taking of his own life. Former senior CIA officer (and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/michael-sulick\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief expert</a>) Mike Sulick <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/covert-action-mental-health-and-a-cold-war-legend-the-story-of-frank-wisner\" target=\"_self\">reviewed</a> the book for us noting that the bio was long overdue and \u201can invaluable contribution to understanding the rewards and pitfalls of covert action as a tool of American foreign policy.\u201d Waller joined us in a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Bb4J847fJi8?si=k1-5aJaPYKDsHrEP\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cover Stories podcast</a> to share some of the secrets of writing about this trailblazing figure of U.S. intelligence.</p><p>A trailblazer of a different kind was Major General Jack Leide whose book, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3IapKsg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Professional Courage: My Journey in Military Intelligence Through Peace, Crisis and War</a></em>, was featured in <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/book-review/telling-it-like-it-is\" target=\"_self\">a January review</a>. Leide has been inducted into four different military halls of fame. The stories he tells \u2013 and the lessons learned in Vietnam, in China during Tiananmen Square, and as Central Command Director of Intelligence during Desert Shield and Desert Storm make it a valuable read. He also kindly joined us for a <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/podcasts/professional-courage-telling-it-like-it-is\" target=\"_self\">Cipher Brief Cover Stories podcast</a> where he told us about the challenges of telling a demanding boss what they need to know rather than what they want to hear.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

The drinking water system, it said, was polluted with a contaminant commonly known as GenX, part of the family of \u201cforever\u201d PFAS chemicals.</p>\n\n<p>It came from a Chemours plant in Fayetteville, near the winding Cape Fear River. Few knew about the contaminated water until the article described the discoveries of scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency and a state university. Given that certain types of PFAS have been linked to cancer, there was widespread anxiety over its potential danger.</p>\n\n<p>In the onslaught of legal action and activism that followed, the EPA during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term took an assertive stance, vowing to combat the spread of PFAS nationwide.</p>\n\n<p>In its big-picture <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/documents/pfas_action_plan_021319_508compliant_1.pdf\">PFAS action plan</a> from 2019, the agency said it would attack this complex problem on multiple fronts. It would, for example, consider limiting the presence of two of the best-known compounds \u2014 PFOA and PFOS \u2014 in drinking water. And, it said, it would find out more about the potential harm of GenX, which was virtually unregulated.</p>\n\n<p>By the time Trump was sworn in for his second term, many of the plan\u2019s suggestions had been put in place. After his first administration said <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-proposed-decision-regulate-pfoa-and-pfos-drinking-water\">PFOA and PFOS in drinking water should be regulated</a>, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-first-ever-national-drinking-water-standard\">standards were finalized</a> under President Joe Biden. Four other types of PFAS, including GenX, were also tagged with limits.</p>\n\n<p>But now, the second Trump administration is pulling back. The EPA said in May that it will <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-it-will-keep-maximum-contaminant-levels-pfoa-pfos\">delay enforcement on  the drinking water limits </a>for PFOA and PFOS until 2031, and it will rescind and reconsider the limits on the other four. Among those who challenged the standards in court is Chemours, which has argued that the EPA, under Biden, \u201cused flawed science and didn\u2019t follow proper rulemaking procedures\u201d for GenX.</p>\n\n<p>These EPA decisions under Trump are part of a slew of delays and course changes to PFAS policies that had been supported in his first term. Even though his earlier EPA pursued a measure that would help hold polluters accountable for cleaning up PFAS, the EPA of his second term has not yet committed to it. The agency also slowed down a process for finding out how industries have used the chemicals, a step prompted by a law signed by Trump in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the EPA is hampering its ability to research pollutants \u2014 the kind of research that made it possible for its own scientists to investigate GenX. As the Trump administration seeks severe reductions in the EPA\u2019s budget, the agency has terminated grants for PFAS studies and paralyzed its scientists with spending restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>Pointing to <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-zeldin-announces-major-epa-actions-combat-pfas-contamination\">earlier announcements</a> on its <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-it-will-keep-maximum-contaminant-levels-pfoa-pfos\">approach to the chemicals</a>, the EPA told ProPublica that it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to addressing PFAS in drinking water and ensuring that regulations issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act follow the law, follow the science, and can be implemented by water systems to strengthen public health protections.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf anything,\u201d the agency added, \u201cthe Trump administration\u2019s historic PFAS plan in 2019 laid the groundwork for the first steps to comprehensively address this contamination across media and we will continue to do so this term.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In public appearances, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has pushed back on the suggestion that his agency weakened the drinking water limits on GenX and similar compounds. Future regulations imposed by his agency, he said, could be more or less stringent. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat we want to do is follow the science, period,\u201d he has said.</p>\n\n<p>That sentiment perplexes scientists and environmental advocates, who say there is already persuasive evidence on the dangers of these chemicals that linger in the environment. <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/human-health-toxicity-assessments-genx-chemicals\">The EPA reviewed GenX</a>, for example, during both the first Trump and Biden administrations. In both 2018 and 2021, the agency pointed to animal studies linking it to cancer, as well as problems with kidneys, immune systems and, especially, livers. (Chemours has argued that certain animal studies have limited relevance to humans.)</p>\n\n<p>Scientists and advocates also said it\u2019s unclear what it means for the EPA to follow the science while diminishing its own ability to conduct research.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why we would want to hamstring the agency that is designed to make sure we have clean air and clean water,\u201d said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist in Oregon who worked with other scientists on Cape Fear River research. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            The Cape Fear River runs near the Chemours plant in Fayetteville, North Carolina.\n    \n            (Ed Kashi/The New York Times/Redux Images)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \nDelays, Confusion Over PFAS\n<p>Favored for their nonstick and liquid-resistant qualities, synthetic PFAS chemicals are widely used in products like raincoats, cookware and fast food wrappers. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/3m-forever-chemicals-pfas-pfos-inside-story\">Manufacturers made the chemicals for decades without disclosing</a> how certain types are toxic at extremely low levels, can accumulate in the body and will scarcely break down over time \u2014 hence the nickname \u201cforever chemicals.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The chemicals persist in soil and water too, making them complicated and costly to clean up, leading to a yearslong push to get such sites covered by the EPA\u2019s Superfund program, which is designed to handle toxic swaths of land. During the first Trump administration, the EPA said it was taking steps toward designating the two legacy compounds, PFOA and PFOS, as \u201chazardous substances\u201d under the Superfund program. Its liability provisions would help hold polluters responsible for the cost of cleaning up.</p>\n\n<p>Moving forward with this designation process was a priority, according to the PFAS plan from Trump\u2019s first term. Zeldin\u2019s EPA <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-zeldin-announces-major-epa-actions-combat-pfas-contamination\">describes that plan as \u201chistoric.</a>\u201d And, when he represented a Long Island district with PFAS problems in Congress, Zeldin <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2467\">voted for a bill</a> that would have directed the EPA to take this step.  </p>\n\n<p>The designation became official under Biden. But business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and organizations representing the construction, recycling and chemical industries, sued. Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation\u2019s playbook for the new administration, also questioned it.</p>\n\n<p>Zeldin has said repeatedly that he wants to hold polluters accountable for PFAS, but his EPA requested three delays in the court case challenging the Superfund designation that helps make it possible.</p>\n\n<p>The agency said in a recent motion it needed the latest pause because new leadership is still reviewing the issues and evaluating the designation in context of its \u201ccomprehensive strategy to address PFOA and PFOS.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The EPA also <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/05/13/2025-08168/perfluoroalkyl-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas-data-reporting-and-recordkeeping-under-the-toxic\">delayed a rule</a> requiring manufacturers and importers to report details about their PFAS use between 2011 and 2022. An annual bill that sets defense policy and spending, signed by Trump in his first term, had charged the EPA with developing such a process. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-finalizes-rule-require-reporting-pfas-data-better-protect-communities-forever\">When Biden\u2019s EPA finalized it</a>, the agency said the rule would provide the largest-ever dataset of PFAS manufactured and used in the United States. It would help authorities understand their spread and determine what protections might be warranted. </p>\n\n<p>Businesses were supposed to start reporting this month. But in a May 2 letter, a coalition of chemical companies <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2025-05/tsca-sec.-21-petition-reporting-and-recordkeeping-requirements-for-certain-per-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas-may-2025_0.pdf\">petitioned the EPA to withdraw the deadline</a>, reconsider the rule and issue a revised one with narrowed scope. </p>\n\n<p>When the EPA delayed the rule less than two weeks later, it said it needed time to prepare for data collection and to consider changes to aspects of the rule.</p>\n\n<p>In an email to ProPublica, the agency said it will address PFAS in many ways. Its approach, the agency said, is to give more time for compliance and to work with water systems to reduce PFAS exposure as quickly as feasible, \u201crather than issue violations and collect fees that don\u2019t benefit public health.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The court expects an update from the EPA in the Superfund designation case by Wednesday, and in the legal challenges to the drinking water standards by July 21. The EPA could continue defending the rules. It could ask the court for permission to reverse its position or to send the rules back to the agency for reconsideration. Or it could also ask for further pauses. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a big unanswered question whether this administration and this EPA is going to be serious about enforcing anything,\u201d said Robert Sussman, a former EPA official from the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. As a lawyer, he now represents environmental groups that filed an amicus brief in PFAS cases.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Back in North Carolina, problems caused by the chemicals continue to play out.</p>\n\n<p>A consent order between the state and Chemours required the manufacturer to drastically reduce the release of GenX and other PFAS into the environment. (The chemicals commonly called GenX refer to HFPO-DA and its ammonium salt, which are involved in the GenX processing aid technology owned by Chemours.)</p>\n\n<p>Chemours told ProPublica that it invested more than $400 million to remediate and reduce PFAS emissions. It also noted that there are hundreds of PFAS users in North Carolina, \u201cas evidenced by PFAS seen upstream and hundreds of miles away\u201d from its Fayetteville plant \u201cthat cannot be traced back to the site.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>PFAS-riddled sea foam continues to wash up on the coastal beaches. Chemours and water utilities, meanwhile, are battling in court about who should cover the cost of upgrades to remove the chemicals from drinking water.</p>\n\n<p>Community forums about PFAS draw triple-digit crowds, even when they\u2019re held on a weeknight, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the volunteer group Clean Cape Fear, which has intervened in federal litigation. In the fast-growing region, new residents are just learning about the chemicals, she said, and they\u2019re angry.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI feel like we\u2019re walking backwards,\u201d Donovan said. Pulling back from the drinking water standards, in particular, is \u201cdisrespectful to this community.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say you\u2019re going to focus on PFAS,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing to never let it cross the finish line and become any meaningful regulation.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n\n            A letter dated April 29, 2025, notifying Michigan State University about the termination of a grant for research into PFAS, one day after the EPA said in a press release that it was committed to combating PFAS contamination by, in part, \u201cstrengthening the science.\u201d\n    \n            (Obtained by ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n            \n                    \n    \n                    \nResearch Under Fire\n<p>The EPA of Trump\u2019s first term didn\u2019t just call for more regulation of PFAS, it also stressed the importance of better understanding the forever chemicals through research and testing. </p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-01/documents/pfas_action_plan_feb2020.pdf\">2020 update</a> to its PFAS action plan, the EPA highlighted its support for North Carolina\u2019s investigation of GenX in the Cape Fear River. And it described its efforts to develop the science on PFAS issues affecting rural economies with \u201cfirst-of-its-kind funding for the agriculture sector.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Zeldin, too, has boasted about advancing PFAS research in an <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-zeldin-announces-major-epa-actions-combat-pfas-contamination\">April news release</a>. \u201cThis is just a start of the work we will do on PFAS to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>At about the same time, though, the agency terminated a host of congressionally appropriated grants for PFAS research, including over $15 million for <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-awards-15-million-research-pfas-exposure-and-reduction-agriculture\">projects focused on food and farmlands</a> in places like Utah, Texas and Illinois.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists at Michigan State University, for example, were investigating how PFAS interacts with water, soil, crops, livestock and biosolids, which are used for fertilizer. They timed their latest study to this year\u2019s growing season, hired staff and partnered with a farm. Then the EPA canceled two grants.</p>\n\n<p>In virtually identical letters, the agency said that each grant \u201cno longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The contrast between the agency\u2019s words and actions raises questions about the process behind its decisions, said Cheryl Murphy, head of Michigan State\u2019s Center for PFAS Research and co-lead of one of the projects.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you halt it right now,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re undermining our ability to translate the science that we\u2019re developing into some policy and guidance to help people minimize their exposure to PFAS.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>At least some of the researchers are appealing the terminations.</p>\n\n<p>About a month after PFAS grants to research teams in Maine and Virginia were terminated for not being aligned with agency priorities, the agency reinstated them. The EPA told ProPublica that \u201cthere will be more updates on research-related grants in the future.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Even if the Michigan State grants are reinstated, there could be lasting consequences, said Hui Li, the soil scientist who led both projects. \u201cWe will miss the season for this year,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cand could lose the livestock on the farm for the research.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Federal researchers are also in limbo. Uncertainty, lost capacity and spending restrictions have stunted the work at an EPA lab in Duluth, Minnesota, that investigates PFAS and other potential hazards, according to several sources connected to it. As one source who works at the lab put it, \u201cWe don\u2019t know how much longer we will be operating as is.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The EPA told ProPublica that it\u2019s \u201ccontinuing to invest in research and labs, including Duluth, to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the agency is asking Congress to eliminate more than half of its own budget. That includes massive staffing cuts, and it would slash nearly all the money for two major programs that help states fund water and wastewater infrastructure. One dates back to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration. The other was <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-03/documents/pfas_fact_sheet_and_case_studies_final.pdf\">spotlighted in a paper by Trump\u2019s first-term EPA</a>, which said communities could use these funds to protect public health from PFAS. It trumpeted examples from places like Michigan and New Jersey.</p>\n\n<p>The EPA lost 727 employees in voluntary separations between Jan. 1 and late June, according to numbers the agency provided to ProPublica. It said it received more than 2,600 applications for the second round of deferred resignations and voluntary early retirements.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese are really technical, difficult jobs,\u201d said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. \u201cAnd the EPA, by encouraging so many employees to leave, is also losing a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of technical expertise.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The shake-up also worries DeWitt, who was one of the scientists who helped investigate the Cape Fear River contamination and who has served on an EPA science advisory board. Her voice shook as she reflected on the EPA\u2019s workforce, \u201csome of the finest scientists I know,\u201d and what their loss means for public well-being.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTaking away this talent from our federal sector,\u201d she said, will have \u201cprofound effects on the agency\u2019s ability to protect people in the United States from hazardous chemicals in air, in water, in soil and potentially in food.\u201d</p>",

The <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/tags/tesla\">Tesla</a> CEO asked the legislators gathered before him to change state law, allowing him to bypass the state\u2019s powerful car dealership lobby and sell his electric vehicles directly to the public. </p>\n\n<p>He painted a bleak picture of what could happen if they didn\u2019t give him his way. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe would, I\u2019m afraid, we would fail,\u201d Musk told the assembled representatives. \u201cSo for us, it\u2019s a matter of life or death.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clad in a dark suit instead of his now ubiquitous black T-shirt and baseball hat, the younger Musk was unable to persuade lawmakers in Austin. That year, <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=83R&amp;Bill=HB3351\">the bill he wanted</a> to pass died.</p>\n\n<p>More than a decade later, however, Musk\u2019s fortunes inside the Texas Capitol have changed \u2014 dramatically. </p>\n\n<p>Musk is now not only one of the richest people in the world, who, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/05/nx-s1-5424686/donald-trump-elon-musk-bromance-breakup\">until recently</a>, was a key member of <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/tags/donald-trump\">President Donald Trump</a>\u2019s second administration, but he\u2019s also become one of the most powerful business and political figures in the state. </p>\n\n<p>During this year\u2019s legislative session, Musk\u2019s lobbyists and representatives publicly advocated for almost a dozen bills that would benefit his companies. The Texas Newsroom identified these priorities by searching legislative records for committee testimony and other evidence of his public stances.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Musk wanted legislators to pass new laws that would make it faster and easier for homeowners to <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB1202\">install backup power generators</a>, like the <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/powerwall\">kind Tesla makes</a>, on their properties. He wanted them to create new crimes so people who fly drones or interfere with operations at his rocket company <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/tags/spacex\">SpaceX</a> can be arrested. And he wanted to change who controlled the highway and <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-04-11/elon-musk-texas-starbase-spacex-launch-election-boca-chica-beach\">public beach near SpaceX</a>\u2019s South Texas site so he can launch his rockets according to his timeline. </p>\n\n<p>Musk got them all.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>In a Capitol where the vast majority of bills fail to pass, all but three of Musk\u2019s public priorities will become law. The two bills his lobbyists openly opposed are dead, including a measure that would have regulated autonomous vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Musk made gains even on bills he didn\u2019t publicly endorse. Texas lawmakers followed the tech giant\u2019s lead by <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB29\">rewriting the state\u2019s corporate laws</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-04-23/texas-creates-its-own-doge-to-make-the-state-more-business-friendly\">creating a new office</a> modeled after the Department of Government Efficiency, the controversial effort he led in the Trump administration to cut federal spending.</p>\n\n<p>By all accounts, Musk\u2019s influence was great enough that he did not have to formally address lawmakers in person this session to make the case for any of his priorities.</p>\n\n<p>Critics said these new laws will hand Musk\u2019s companies more cash, more power and more protection from scrutiny as <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/austin/2025-02-12/elon-musk-doge-texas-business-x-spacex-boring-snailbrook-grow-expand\">his business footprint continues to expand</a> across Texas. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe real harm is the influence of a private company on the decisions made by government,\u201d Cyrus Reed, the conservation director for the Sierra Club\u2019s Lone Star Chapter, told The Texas Newsroom. The Sierra Club is part of a group suing the state over SpaceX\u2019s activities in South Texas. </p>\n\n<p>Musk and his representatives did not respond to requests for an interview. He <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/30/nx-s1-5415641/musk-leaves-doge-what-comes-next\">recently ended his run with DOGE</a>, and his  relationship with <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/05/nx-s1-5424686/donald-trump-elon-musk-bromance-breakup\">Trump has increasingly frayed</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Contrary to his slash-and-burn tactics in Washington, D.C., where he bulldozed his way onto the scene after Trump\u2019s reelection, Musk has played the long game to amass power in Texas. He still hasn\u2019t succeeded in changing Texas law to allow for Tesla direct sales, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from steadily investing his personal and professional capital in the state over more than a decade. Most of his businesses, including the tunneling firm The Boring Company, <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/tags/twitter\">social media giant X</a> and Tesla, <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/austin/2025-02-12/elon-musk-doge-texas-business-x-spacex-boring-snailbrook-grow-expand\">are now headquartered here</a>. While it\u2019s still based in California, SpaceX operates <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/austin/2025-02-12/elon-musk-doge-texas-business-x-spacex-boring-snailbrook-grow-expand\">production</a>, <a href=\"https://www.expressnews.com/business/article/spacex-expanding-waco-rocket-engine-starbase-19925816.php\">testing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/energy-environment/2025-05-06/spacex-starbase-starship-launch-texas-faa-environment-approval\">launch</a> sites across Texas. </p>\n\n<p>Musk has also moved his personal home to the state, reportedly securing properties in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/technology/elon-musk-texas-neighbors.html\">the Austin area</a> and <a href=\"https://observer.com/2023/08/elon-musk-boca-chica-home-photo/\">South Texas</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the Texas Capitol, Musk\u2019s power is subtle but undeniable. </p>\n\n<p>Calendars and emails obtained by The Texas Newsroom through public information requests show his company\u2019s representatives met regularly with lawmakers backing his priority bills and invited Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick to tour SpaceX. Patrick, who leads the state Senate, also penned a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration supporting the rocket company\u2019s request to increase its launches in South Texas.</p>\n\n<p>Texas politics, with its long history of outsize characters, has never seen the likes of Musk, said Rice University political scientist Mark Jones. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cEven in the heyday of the [George W.] Bush era, you couldn\u2019t find somebody who had such dramatic wealth as Musk, who also had the same level of access and business interests here in Texas,\u201d Jones told The Texas Newsroom. \u201cToday, Elon Musk is arguably the most powerful and influential private citizen in the country.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            A mural of Elon Musk in downtown Brownsville, Texas\n    \n            (Michael Gonzalez for KUT News)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n\u201cIt\u2019s All to Help Elon\u201d\n<p>When lawmakers convened their 2025 legislative session in January, one of Musk\u2019s top priorities was quickly clear. He wanted more control over the <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-04-11/elon-musk-texas-starbase-spacex-launch-election-boca-chica-beach\">area around SpaceX\u2019s launch site</a> in South Texas.</p>\n\n<p>Known as Starbase, the massive rocket testing and launch facility has come to dominate the small rural area between Brownsville, on the border, and the Gulf of Mexico. It is the launch site for <a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/\">Starship</a>, the rocket meant to eventually take humans to Mars and the heart of Musk\u2019s mission to make humans a multiplanetary species. The FAA recently gave SpaceX permission to <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/energy-environment/2025-05-06/spacex-starbase-starship-launch-texas-faa-environment-approval\">increase Starship launches fivefold</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Although SpaceX owns most of the land around Starbase, county officials retained the authority over access to the adjacent public beach, called Boca Chica. The county worked closely with SpaceX to ensure the area was cleared ahead of launches, but the company\u2019s leaders did not have ultimate control over the process.   </p>\n\n<p>That changed this year. First, Musk <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-04-11/elon-musk-texas-starbase-spacex-launch-election-boca-chica-beach\">decided to incorporate</a> the launch site as its own city. That happened on May 3, when the few residents who live in the area \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-05-01/elon-musk-spacex-starbase-city-texas-election-vote-voters-employees\">most of whom The Texas Newsroom determined work for SpaceX</a> \u2014 voted to <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-05-03/elon-musk-texas-spacex-city-starbase-vote-election-results\">create the new city of Starbase</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Musk then wanted state lawmakers to hand the new city the power to close Boca Chica Beach and the adjoining public highway during the week, a change the county officials opposed.</p>\n\n<p>State Sen. Adam Hinojosa, a newly elected Republican who represents the area, authored the legislation to shift control to Starbase. Dozens of SpaceX employees got involved in the effort, submitting <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/publiccomments/billhistory/HB04660H.pdf\">pages of identical comments</a> to lawmakers in support. </p>\n\n<p>Democrats succeeded in killing Hinojosa\u2019s bill, prompting local <a href=\"https://myrgv.com/publications/the-monitor/2025/04/28/spacex-legislation-dies-would-have-removed-countys-authority-on-closures/#google_vignette\">activists to celebrate</a>. Their victory was short-lived. Late in the session, lawmakers decided instead to shift some of this power to the Texas Space Commission, which facilitates the state\u2019s space exploration agenda.</p>\n\n<p>The new law states that the commission\u2019s board can close highways and gulf beaches with the approval of a local municipality, which, in this case, is Starbase. SpaceX retains a connection to the commission itself: Kathy Lueders, who confirmed that she left her job as Starbase general manager last month, still sits on the Space Commission board. She directed additional questions to the commission. </p>\n\n<p>The Space Commission declined to answer questions on SpaceX\u2019s potential future involvement with these discussions.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe way I view it is SpaceX wanted a certain amount of power,\u201d said Reed, with the Sierra Club. \u201cAnd at the end of the day, they didn\u2019t quite get it, but they got something pretty close.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB5246\">bill</a> passed along largely partisan lines. Republican state Rep. Greg Bonnen, who authored the bill, did not respond to a request for comment about the role Starbase may play now that it will become law. </p>\n\n<p>Lawmakers passed several more bills to benefit spaceports, the sites where spacecraft launch, like SpaceX. </p>\n\n<p>While Texas is home to multiple spaceports, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin, SpaceX dwarfs the rest in size and scope of influence across the state and country, boasting large federal government contracts and a growing satellite industry.</p>\n\n<p>Hinojosa was an author or sponsor on most of these bills; he did not respond to multiple requests for an interview or comment for this story.</p>\n\n<p>Other than the beach closure legislation, many passed with the support of Democrats.</p>\n\n<p>At SpaceX\u2019s urging, Texas lawmakers passed a measure to <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB1197\">ban drones over spaceports</a>. They also added spaceports to the <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB1198\">state\u2019s \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d facilities</a>, which already include airports and military bases. The law will make it a felony to intentionally damage or interrupt the operation of any site where a spacecraft is tested or launched. Similar critical infrastructure laws have been used in other states <a href=\"https://www.icnl.org/wp-content/uploads/CI-Bill-Briefer-final-formatted.pdf\">to arrest people protesting</a> oil and gas pipeline projects.</p>\n\n<p>Bekah Hinojosa with the South Texas Environmental Justice Network, a local activist group, told The Texas Newsroom the new critical infrastructure law will let Musk \u201cmilitarize our Boca Chica Beach for his dangerous rocket testing endeavors.\" </p>\n\n<p>The Sierra Club and other groups from South Texas, including a local Indigenous tribe, are suing the state, arguing that closing Boca Chica violates an amendment to the Texas Constitution that <a href=\"https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CN/htm/CN.1/CN.1.33.htm\">protects access to public beaches</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The General Land Office, the main defendant in that suit, declined to comment. In court filings, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argues the state can still regulate beach access for public safety reasons and that it cannot be sued in this case because it has immunity. The case is pending at the Texas Supreme Court.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            A rally at Boca Chica Beach against the incorporation of Starbase on May 3\n    \n            (Michael Gonzalez for KUT News)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Legislators also passed two more new laws that will shield companies like SpaceX from <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB1706\">public scrutiny</a> and <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB4157\">legal challenges</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB1706\">One</a> will exempt certain military and aerospace issues from public meetings laws, allowing elected officials in some cases to discuss these topics behind closed doors. The proposal was so concerning to residents who live close to SpaceX\u2019s facility near Waco, where locals say the company\u2019s rocket testing has <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna52976191\">spooked livestock</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kwtx.com/2024/05/02/waco-man-suing-spacex-alleges-rocket-engine-testing-vibrations-damaged-his-home/\">damaged homes</a>, that they <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/publiccomments/billhistory/HB02679H.pdf\">submitted</a> a dozen comments against it.  </p>\n\n<p>This law went into effect on May 15.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB4157\">Another</a> new law will make it harder for crew members and certain other employees to sue space flight companies. This, like most new legislation approved this session, will become law on Sept. 1.</p>\n\n<p>SpaceX\u2019s only significant public defeat during this year\u2019s legislative session was the failure of a bill it supported to give spaceports a <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB3045\">tax cut</a>. The measure would have <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/fiscalnotes/html/HB03045H.htm\">cost nearly $14.5 million</a> over five years, according to an official estimate from the Legislative Budget Board. </p>\n\n<p>Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin, believes Texas is pandering to Musk. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all to help Elon,\u201d said Jah, who added that his viewpoint is rooted in resisting policies that enable what he called \u201cenvironmental plunder masked as \u2018innovation.\u2019\u201d He has concerns that the state is investing in spaceports, most notably Musk\u2019s, while carving out exceptions that prohibit public insight and input into what\u2019s happening at those facilities.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s this whole cloak of secrecy with whatever Elon is doing,\u201d Jah said. \u201cWe will not and should not cease to launch satellites or explore space. But the way in which we do it matters a lot.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\u201cThey Never Come Out of the Shadows\u201d\n<p>This year, Tesla\u2019s lobbyists publicly advocated against only two bills. Both died. </p>\n\n<p>One was a GOP-authored <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB1378\">proposal</a> intended to create a buffer zone between homes and large-scale energy storage facilities <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/megapack\">like the kind Tesla sells</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB3837\">The other bill</a> would have imposed more regulations on the type of cars that <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/transportation/2025-05-21/elon-musk-says-teslas-autonomous-taxis-will-be-on-austin-streets-next-month\">Musk is rolling out as robotaxis in Texas</a>, and would have required a public hearing if a collision involving an autonomous vehicle resulted in a fatality.</p>\n\n<p>Bill author Rep. Terry Canales, an Edinburg Democrat, believes his legislation failed because it was not pro-industry enough. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cTesla is the worst actor that I\u2019ve ever dealt with in the Capitol. They\u2019re subversive. They never come out of the shadows,\u201d Canales told The Texas Newsroom. \u201cNot only did I not hear from them, I didn\u2019t expect to hear from them because that\u2019s the way they operate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Lawmakers instead advanced <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB2425\">a different bill</a>, one with a lighter regulatory touch that was crafted with input from the autonomous vehicle industry. </p>\n\n<p>It will require commercial operators, such as robotaxi and driverless big rig companies, to obtain authorization from the state. This approval can be revoked if the company\u2019s vehicles endanger the public, including causing \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d though it requires no public hearings in the case of a fatality, as Canales\u2019 bill would have done. Autonomous vehicle companies will also have to develop plans for interacting with emergency responders. </p>\n\n<p>Tesla took a neutral stance on the legislation. But the bill\u2019s author, state Sen. Robert Nichols, R-Jacksonville, told The Texas Newsroom that Tesla\u2019s team participated in work groups and stakeholder conversations with industry groups, trial lawyers and others. </p>\n\n<p>Texas has been at the forefront of testing this technology for years, rolling out its first regulations in 2017. But with more autonomous vehicles hitting the streets, Nichols said it was time to clarify the rules and called his bill \u201ca real opportunity here to actually improve safety.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Nichols\u2019 legislation initially died in the Texas House. But with less than a week before lawmakers packed up to go home, a House member added the entirety of Nichols\u2019 bill as an amendment to <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB2807\">another transportation bill</a>, which will become law Sept. 1.</p>\n\n<p>Tray Gober, a personal injury lawyer who handles vehicle crash cases in Austin, said it\u2019s smart to get new regulations for autonomous vehicles on the books. But he worries that Texas is rushing to give its blessing to a technology that has not been fully tested. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about rockets crashing into the ocean. We\u2019re talking about cars crashing into other people,\u201d he said, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413240/elon-musk-starship-rocket-launch-spacex\">comparing Tesla to SpaceX</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be people that are hurt during this process of improving these systems, and that\u2019s unfortunate. I think it\u2019s viewed as collateral damage by these companies.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When asked about concerns that there could be fatalities as the number of driverless cars grows in Texas, Nichols said, \u201cThere probably will be. Eventually there will be. I would not doubt that.\u201d But he pointed to studies showing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/411522/self-driving-car-artificial-intelligence-autonomous-vehicle-safety-waymo-google\">autonomous vehicles are safer</a> than human drivers. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you start looking at the breakdown of the fatalities on the roads and the crashes and the wrecks, what causes them? It\u2019s not equipment failure. It\u2019s driver distraction,\u201d he told The Texas Newsroom. </p>\n\n<p>Critics of these studies argue their scope is too narrow to make conclusions about the safety of self-driving technology. Citing safety concerns, some local lawmakers asked Tesla\u2019s robotaxi rollout in Austin to <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/transportation/2025-06-20/austin-texas-tesla-self-driving-robotaxi-launch-elon-musk\">be delayed. The company continued with the launch but</a> with <a href=\"https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2025/06/22/tesla-robotaxis-begin-rolling-in-austin-but-only-for-a-select-few/84308887007/\">human monitors</a> in the passenger seats. </p>\n\n<p>Many Democrats opposed Nichols\u2019 proposal. But at least three other bills affecting Tesla got bipartisan support. </p>\n\n<p>At times, the Sierra Club was fighting against Musk\u2019s SpaceX bills while working with his Tesla lobbyists on clean energy legislation, said Reed, the club\u2019s conservation director. For example, Tesla and the Sierra Club both supported legislation to create <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB3824\">new fire standards</a> for battery energy storage facilities and address the environmental and financial challenges associated with <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB3809\">decommissioning them</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Tesla also backed a bill that had bipartisan support to make it easier for homeowners to install backup power generators, such as the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/powerwall\">Powerwall</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Reed said Musk\u2019s shift to the right has created interesting bedfellows, sometimes making it easier for Republicans to back some of the energy policies more traditionally associated with progressives. </p>\n\n<p>He remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting time in our country, right?\u201d</p>\n\nMusk\u2019s Indirect Influence\n</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            A Tesla showroom in Austin on March 24\n    \n            (Michael Minasi/KUT News)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>For all the bills Musk pushed to see pass, he also indirectly influenced the creation of new laws on which he did not take a public stance.</p>\n\n<p>Texas lawmakers created the <a href=\"https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-signs-texas-doge-into-law-at-texas-capitol\">state\u2019s own DOGE office</a> housed under the governor, the name an homage to Musk\u2019s controversial federal cost-slashing effort in Washington, D.C. </p>\n\n<p>Musk himself took no public role in creating the new office. But at a signing ceremony for the bill, Gov. Greg Abbott explained he was the inspiration.</p>\n\n<p>Texas legislators also rewrote the state\u2019s corporate laws after Musk raised concerns about business codes in other states. Authored by Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes, <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB29\">the rewrite</a> shields business leaders from lawsuits and establishes thresholds for the types of legal challenges shareholders can file. </p>\n\n<p>Musk and his lobbyists never came out in support of the bill, but he has long complained that states needed to shore up protections for CEOs and other business leaders.</p>\n\n<p>Musk began crusading on the issue after his <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/01/31/1228066397/elon-musk-cannot-keep-tesla-pay-package-worth-more-than-55-billion-judge-rules\">$55 billion compensation package</a> at Tesla was challenged in Delaware\u2019s business courts. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2024/02/15/musk-says-spacex-has-moved-state-of-incorporation-to-texas-amid-feud-with-delaware/\">Musk moved many of his businesses elsewhere</a>, including Texas, and publicly <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1825450020721569893\">urged other companies</a> to \u201cget the hell out of Delaware.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>The legislation written in response was dubbed the \u201cDExit\u201d bill.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTexas is much better than Delaware,\u201d Musk posted on <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1908890391887167717\">X in early April</a>, just days after the bill passed the state Senate. \u201cIf Delaware doesn\u2019t reform, it will lose all its corporate business.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Last year, a Delaware judge ruled <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/01/31/1228066397/elon-musk-cannot-keep-tesla-pay-package-worth-more-than-55-billion-judge-rules\">Musk\u2019s pay package</a> violated his fiduciary duties to the company\u2019s stockholders. He won <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/06/14/g-s1-4359/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package-shareholder-vote\">most of it back</a> in a shareholder vote, but the judge <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5214484/elon-musk-tesla-compensation\">again rejected his pay package</a> in December.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In an interview, Hughes told The Texas Newsroom he heard input from different groups in crafting the Texas legislation and could not remember whether Musk\u2019s companies were involved. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-signs-pro-growth-business-legislation-into-law\">Abbott signed the DExit bill</a> and a handful of other business bills into law on May 14.

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION</strong> \u2013 On January 27, 2025, President Trump signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/the-iron-dome-for-america/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Executive Order</a> aimed at defending the U.S. against an attack by ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles as well as other advanced aerial attacks; the Golden Dome initiative. The Pentagon moved out smartly to fulfill this order. Industry lined up with ideas on how to defend the U.S. and Department of Defense bureaucrats convened and developed a strategy. All the work that has happened is needed. But we need more.</p><p>We need to build the technology to support defensive systems to secure the homeland from adversary advanced aerial attacks. But we are missing a crucial part of the equation which could be happening now with only limited additional resources.</p><p>The U.S. needs to be moving out diligently to put in place the best collection capability to provide early warning regarding U.S. adversaries. Too often, the U.S. jumps to a solution and forgets that we must start with intelligence to put the building blocks in place to address the solution.</p><p>In this case, the Executive Order asks for a study of adversary threat but that is all. There is nothing about developing intelligence for early warning on adversary intent. This is an important oversight. The U.S. must focus on developing warning that lets decisionmakers know when our adversaries are planning a launch. The important satellite tracking mechanisms that will follow the launches should only be used if the intelligence community misses the early warning.</p><p>To ensure the U.S. is using its resources to its best ability in building the Golden Dome, the entire intelligence infrastructure of collection, technology to support the collection, and ability to exploit the collection - to include analytical experts - must be synergized to provide early warning that an adversary is considering an aerial attack.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Upgrade your access to exclusive content by <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\" target=\"_self\">becoming a subscriber</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>The literature regarding golden dome focuses on interception and tracking missiles once they are launched. There is a lot of discussion about the need for a defensive system. All of this is warranted, and it is the area where the most money needs to be spent. However, the literature is much less focused on what the U.S. needs to put in place prior to launch to buy time for developing options to counter an attack and limit the risk regarding that decision making process.</p><p>Without the platforms that can collect on adversary intent, capability, movement, and other anomalies, decisionmakers could be left with rushed choices on the use of defensive systems that could result in catastrophic consequences if the technology detects missiles too late or misreads that aerial attacks are coming our way when they may not be.</p><p>Time is the important variable for decision makers. The earlier the intelligence community can present them with analysis and reporting of adversary intent, the better and likely less risky the consequences are for the US.</p><p>For example, if the Intelligence Community (IC) can provide the President with information that an adversary has given an order to prepare an aerial attack against the U.S. - while the attack is being planned but prior to launch - then there are more options to stop that attack.</p><p>The IC is then alerted to track adversary movements so that decisionmakers know how much time they have to decide on an option and which option will work best under the circumstances. In this scenario, U.S. decision makers have days instead of hours, to plan. This allows for a wide range of options to stop a launch - from diplomacy, to sanctions, to military action.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>The current Golden Dome literature talks a lot about tracking these aerial devices and calls for a new look at radars, both space and ground based. As I stated, a reliance on this architecture risks being too late in the decision cycle. Kudos to the Army for recognizing the need for <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/land/2025/03/28/army-looks-to-artificial-intelligence-to-enhance-future-golden-dome/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">smart warning</a> by integrating artificial intelligence into their Integrated Battle Command system, but even this initiative does not hit the early warning collection issue head on.</p><p>LTG Gainey, commanding general of the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) hinted at the issue during a House Armed Services <a href=\"https://armedservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ltg_gainey.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">subcommittee hearing</a> in April when he said the Golden Dome also includes left-of-launch operations, providing deny, delay, disrupt and degrade missile defeat effects in coordination with global combatant commands, the Intelligence Community, Joint Staff, interagency, and Office of the Secretary of Defense. This still does not highlight the need for early warning.</p><p>The U.S. can detect missile launches with its existing Space-Based Infrared System satellites in geosynchronous orbit. These satellites can tell where a ballistic missile is going and where its warheads are likely to fall, but the United States wants to develop better warning and tracking by creating a Custody Layer \u2014 satellites that will watch where all the other guy\u2019s stuff is \u2014 and a Tracking Layer that could also determine where more sophisticated weapons, like hypersonic missiles, are headed.</p><p>Fred Kennedy, the inaugural director of the U.S. Space Development Agency and a former director of DARPA\u2019s Tactical Technology Office, shares in <em><a href=\"https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/golden-dome-analysis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Aerospace America</a></em>, his vision of a Custody Layer: \"a constellation that would be equipped with moving target indicator radar, imaging radar and other sensors, to keep tabs on an adversary\u2019s offensive 'internet of things.' \u2026..These satellites would be the equivalent of Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System and U-2 aircraft, but in space. To strike a missile, you have to know where it could be launched from, after all. Complementing the Custody Layer was the Tracking Layer, the satellites that would detect and track hypersonic or ballistic weapons after launch.\"</p><p>This is all important work and needed but note, it is all focused on launch.</p><p>If decisionmakers are being told by the space-based interceptors that attacks are on the way\u2014there is only one option, to intercept. But what if those interceptors misread the information or what if they did not read the tracking in time? In either scenario it could be the beginning of a catastrophic event that is based on a mistake.</p><p>For that reason, we need to start with the intelligence and put as much effort into that as we are on the interceptors. Collaboration with the Pentagon and other agencies that track satellite imagery is key. I would also add that the Defense Intelligence Agency needs to play a primary role in this initiative which must include increased human intelligence and all forms of open source to include commercial data.</p><p>With the intelligence community and department of defense getting smaller, we need to work together more than ever. Defending our nation is a team sport that requires strong intelligence to set up decision makers and operators to make the best decisions possible, helping to mitigate risk. This cannot happen without the defense and intelligence communities working together to provide the first warning\u2014way before launch. Now is the time to push the intelligence community to upgrade technologies that track missiles by providing warning of aberrations in patterns before launch.</p><p>By using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to synthesize critical technical collection with anomalies in open source (OSINT), commercial (CAI), and personal (PAI) data, we could have the cultural breakthrough we need to change how the intelligence community uses technical collection fused with OSINT, CAI, PAI and AI. Against this national security backdrop, we could have our first big win in changing how we process intelligence and safeguard the US. NGA\u2019s Maven program is a big step in the right direction of fusing intelligence to support DoD and the rest of the national security establishment. This practice needs to be more widespread.</p><p>Now is the time to use proven technology with expert analysis to provide decision makers increased time and space to counter aerial attacks on the homeland. The resources involved, compared to the amount needed for satellites and lasers to shoot down the missiles, is minimal. This action can be started now, the technology exists. Putting in place early warning buys time for the US to develop the rest of the Golden Dome security.</p><p><em><strong>Who\u2019s Reading this?

NATO also put on a show of unity and recommitted to collective defense. </em></em></p><p><em><em>The Cipher Brief spoke with Lieutenant General Ben Hodges (Ret.), who served as commanding general, U.S. Army Europe, about what the alliance has to do post-summit to ready defenses for a \u201cfight tonight\u201d posture. </em></em></p><p><em><em>Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

I was struck by how effusive, really, President Trump was in his praise of what happened at The Hague and very clear in his commitments. What's your take on how that all played out?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>I think I\u2019m more relieved than surprised. I'm biased because I\u2019ve been a NATO officer my whole Army life, as all Army officers are part of the Alliance. I recognize its importance for America's strategic interests. I'm glad that the president did what he did. There was a huge sigh of relief in the Hague that he even showed up. There was some anxiety about that, or that he might blow it up somehow. So the best outcome did happen. He was there. He stayed for the entire thing. He met with President Zelensky. We got an agreement on 5% across the alliance, with one exception, and then a public affirmation of American commitment to the alliance by the president. That's pretty good.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>You\u2019re referring to Article 5 of the NATO charter, which says an attack on any member must be met by all other members. There\u2019s been a kind of rallying cry among some Trump supporters that the idea that American soldiers would fight for Estonia, for example, that\u2019s never gonna happen \u2014 that's not America first. Talk a bit about the significance of that specific commitment, because it seems to put to rest what's been said before on that front.</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which created NATO, says an armed attack on one shall be considered an armed attack on all. That commitment to collective security has been the glue that held the alliance together. The Soviet Union for decades, now Russia and other adversaries, see this commitment of now 32 nations that if one is attacked, all the other nations would consider it an armed attack on themselves. That was such a powerful part of the deterrence when it's backed up by real credible capabilities. </p><p>For the first time in my life, in his last administration, the president called that into question. I was horrified. That sort of opens a door to a terrible miscalculation by Moscow that maybe the U.S. would not be so committed. Then the Russians could achieve what has always been their dream, which is to break the alliance, to see that members would not respond, and also to continue driving a wedge between Europe and North America. So it was important that the president affirmed it very strongly, clearly and publicly. </p><p>Now, some people ask why would we have American soldiers dying for Estonia? It's an absolutely ridiculous assertion because that is people not understanding why the alliance is so important for us. By the way, this Article 5 has only been invoked once in the almost 80 years of history of NATO, and that was after 9/11, when you had Estonians who came and died because of the United States. </p><p>Our economic interests are tied to a very prosperous Europe, so we need Europe to be stable and secure and prosperous because it affects our economy. Secondly, the access that we have in Europe from the UK all the way to Turkey and everywhere in between enables us to project power, not only in Europe, but also into the Middle East and down into Africa.</p><p>And of course, even the United States does not have enough capability to do everything that needs to be done to protect all of our interests around the world. We need allies, and all of our best and most reliable allies come from Europe, as well as Canada and Australia.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </em></strong></em><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>Apply for a seat at the table today.</em></strong></em></u></a></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>Do you think this whole NATO-U.S. rift, whatever one calls it, is that all over behind us?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>NATO, the most successful and longest alliance in the history of the world, has 32 nations now. There are going to be huge disputes between nations all the time. France kicked NATO out back during the time of de Gaulle. They left the military structure of NATO for several decades, but came back. The U.S. had huge debates with the UK and France after the Suez crisis. Turkey and Greece have been almost at war throughout. So, there are always challenges inside any sort of a coalition or alliance for all kinds of obvious reasons. </p><p>The thing that kept us together was always American leadership and the commitment of several nations to say, look, this is too important for us to lose this collective security because of some argument over an economic thing or past grievance. And there's a reason that there are nations still in a queue wanting to join NATO, because they know that their security is so much better if they're part of this alliance.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>The core takeaway seems to be this pledge that all the members except for Spain have made to spend 5% of their GDP on military or military-related stuff. How big a deal is this?</em></em></p><p> <em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges:</em></strong></em> It's an expectation. It's a commitment that everybody achieves this 5% threshold for investment in defense: 3.5% for traditional, what we would consider defense investments, equipment, training, ammunition, personnel; and then 1.5% for infrastructure, rail, ports, cyber protection, all the things necessary to be able to move alliance capabilities around. </p><p>Obviously these things will be exploited in some countries. That would not shock me. But the key was that nations are going to invest in infrastructure, which is badly needed, and the cyber protection of this transportation infrastructure. But also, 3.5 % of GDP, that's almost double for every country from what it was 10 years ago. The United States is not even at 3.5 right now, by the way. So this is going to be a real increase. </p><p>Having said all that\u2014and I do believe in the importance of a metric like that\u2014the most important thing, of course, is capability. Do we have the actual capability to do what we're supposed to do? That\u2019s what will deter the Russians, not a sign on the board that says, hey, we're 3.5. It\u2019s real capability: units that are properly trained, fully manned and have lots of ammunition, aircraft that fly, ships that sail. That's got to be the focus. So I'm glad we got this done, but now we've got to make sure that we turn that money into real capability.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>Do you mean how they spend it? </em></em> </p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>That is a part of it. Where does it go? Germany has a lot of money out there, but the processes are still several years behind. So they've got to fix things internally to take all these euros and turn them into combat formations and capability. They've got the right leadership now to do that in Chancellor Merz.</p><p>But also, I think it's important that we emphasize the importance of readiness to be able to fight tonight. This is a mindset thing. It's not just about buying new planes and equipment and hundreds of thousands of drones. Are you ready to actually deploy on very short notice and fight tonight? Can you get there and do you have what you need? To me, that has got to be job one for every secretary of defense, ministers of defense\u2014 readiness.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>On that \u201cfight tonight\u201d point, it is worth noting that these pledges are to be met by 2035. That's 10 years from now. And obviously, some of the stuff we're talking about takes a long time to manufacture and get out to the battlefield. How concerned are you about that time frame?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges:</em></strong></em> It took us 10 years to get where we are now from Wales. A lot of nations are now spending more than they have since the end of the Cold War. So, of course, I don't like it. We should already be there, including the United States. But I think what we'll see is different leaders, including the American president, continue to track every year. You can't do what they call a hockey stick, where you stay where you are for eight years and then expect that you'll get credit for jacking it up at the end. So there's going to be continued pressure.</p><p>But honestly I don't think too many nations are going to need that pressure. What we're seeing in Germany and in the UK, Finland all the way down to Romania. They're not confused about who the enemy is \u2014 it's Russia. These countries were already moving well beyond 3.5% before this summit. So, I think we're on the right arc and right direction in most places, just not all.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

It suddenly seemed a little bit on the back burner. What are your thoughts on how Ukraine comes out of this summit?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>This is my biggest disappointment from this summit. Ukraine was exactly, what you said, put on a back burner. I'm glad that President Zelensky showed up, that he was invited and that he attended. I'm glad that President Trump met with President Zelensky for about 45 minutes or so. While the president did not reveal a lot of the details, he was more positive about Ukraine than I'd heard from him in quite some time. </p><p>Now, to be candid, the president changes his mind all the time but I hope that this signals that he is more willing and open to helping Ukraine as most of our European allies are. I had hoped that this summit would be another affirmation by the Alliance that we're going to do everything we can to help Ukraine. The organizers shortened it in hopes of making sure that President Trump would stay for the whole thing. And so Ukraine was kind of taken out of the agenda. </p><p>Nonetheless, what's most important is that there seems to have been a positive meeting there. And most of our European allies are even more committed to helping Ukraine defeat Russia.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em><em>You've made the point that Russia is incredibly weakened militarily right now with casualties, the economy, and so forth. And it doesn't seem, in that sense, to be much of a threat. Of course, everything we're talking about and what they were talking about at the summit is all about the Russia threat. So how should we understand the nature of that threat given how weak the country is today?</em></em></p><p><em><strong><em>Lt. Gen. Hodges: </em></strong></em>This is a great question. Russia, I was certain, would not have made it this long. Given the casualties that they have suffered, the effects of some sanctions on them, and now it looks like they've probably lost Iran as an ally or a source of drones. But China has picked up some of the slack. North Korea continues to provide ammunition. And Russia right now has transitioned to a wartime economy because of course they don't have to worry too much about whether or not the peasants are unhappy that they can't get a new refrigerator. Putin does not have to respond to this sort of thing the way any other democratic leader would have to respond. So he's putting a lot of resources into this. </p><p>That would be over if we could figure out how to stop Russia from exporting oil to China and India. But as long as they can keep doing that, and as long as oil prices stay up, then Russia can keep doing what they're doing for quite some time. At the recent economic forum that Russia hosts each year, President Putin sort of downplayed the economic situation challenges they have. But his own people publicly were saying that they're almost in recession, that they are in fact in trouble.</p><p>What I am sure of is that if Ukraine capitulates or fails, or if we turn our back on Ukraine and Russia is able to take a couple of years to rebuild and fix what is broken, they will be knocking on the door of Moldova and probably of Latvia. Their objective is to break the alliance, to show NATO that nations are not really willing to fight against Russia over a piece of Estonia or Latvia. That would be their terrible miscalculation. So to make sure that the Russians never make that terrible miscalculation, we have to get back to where we were in the Cold War days of spending what's necessary, being prepared so that you can have another 40-50 years of no war with Russia.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

But over the past few years, they\u2019ve become New York\u2019s predominant response to homelessness outside New York City, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/new-york-homelessness-hotels\">a recent investigation by New York Focus and ProPublica found</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Social services agencies across the state now place nearly half of all individuals and families seeking shelter in hotels. Yet those placed in hotels often go without services that they\u2019re supposed to receive in shelters, such as meals, help finding housing and sometimes child care so they can look for work.</p>\n\n<p>The growing reliance on hotels has been driven by soaring rent, shelter closures and a spike in evictions that followed a moratorium during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The state Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance has known about the problem for years and even put rules to address the issue on its regulatory agenda.

As the population in hotels shot up, so did the bill. Over that period, spending on hotels outside of New York City more than tripled to $110 million.</p>\n\n<p>OTDA oversees the state\u2019s county-run social services districts. The agency\u2019s commissioner, Barbara Guinn, said that it prefers that counties use shelters, but that there aren\u2019t enough beds for everyone who needs one. She said that the agency hadn\u2019t studied the growth in hotel use.</p>\n        \n            \n    \n    \n    \n                            \n\n    \n            Required Services in Shelters vs. Hotels\n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Note: Requirements are for hotels outside of New York City. New York regulations state that hotels can be considered shelters, and thus mandated to provide services. But there aren\u2019t any that are currently required to do so, Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance spokesperson Anthony Farmer said.

New York requires family shelters to provide services like child care, assistance finding housing and three meals a day. But the regulations generally exempt hotels.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s an exception: A hotel is supposed to be considered a shelter if it \u201cprimarily\u201d serves temporary housing recipients. OTDA spokesperson Anthony Farmer said that the agency interprets \u201cprimarily\u201d to mean \u201cexclusively, or almost exclusively,\u201d and that no hotels currently meet that standard. An analysis of the agency\u2019s data by New York Focus and ProPublica found that welfare recipients made up over half of the capacity for at least 16 hotels during fiscal year 2024.</p>\n\n<p>Guinn said that social services offices have to work within the confines of what hotel owners will allow, and that counties try to provide services off-site.</p>\n        \n            \n    \n    \n    \n                            \n\n    \n            The Number of Individuals and Families Housed in Hotels for More Than Six Months Nearly Tripled From 2022 to 2024\n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Data Source: Analysis of Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance data on emergency shelter payments.

The number of families and individuals spending at least six months out of the year in hotels nearly tripled from 2022 to 2024.</p>\n\n<p>The lack of services leads to people getting stuck in the system, creating a snowball effect, said Steve Berg, chief policy officer for the National Alliance to End Homelessness.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s this expanding problem,\u201d he said. \u201cA good shelter should be housing-focused. If they don\u2019t have a pretty substantial effort to move people quickly back into housing and provide the services that are necessary to do that, the shelters quickly fill up, and then they just need more shelters.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Farmer said via email that a lack of affordable housing contributes to the longer stays, and that counties can use other funding to help people move back into permanent housing.</p>\n        \n            \n    \n    \n    \n                            \n\n    \n            New York Social Services Agencies Frequently Paid Hotels Over Fair Market Rent for a Two-Bedroom Apartment\n                <p>Nearly half of all payments to hotels were for more than twice the counties\u2019 FMR.</p>\n\n    \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Data Source: Analysis of Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance data on emergency shelter payments; U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development fair market rent data for two-bedroom apartments in each county for federal fiscal year 2024.\n    \n            (Lucas Waldron/ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Many hotels are charging rates higher than rent for permanent housing.</p>\n\n<p>The news organizations found that the overwhelming majority of hotel payments exceeded fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the same county. (Fair market rent is defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as the 40th percentile of rent plus utilities in the local housing market.) The rates charged were often more than twice that.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re forced to rent hotel rooms across the state, and the operators of these places understand that,\u201d said state Sen. Roxanne Persaud, a Democrat and chair of the chamber\u2019s Social Services Committee. \u201cThe municipalities\u2019 backs are against the wall. And so they must place the unhoused person or persons somewhere. And so that\u2019s why you see the cost is skyrocketing, because people understand that it\u2019s an easy way to make money off the government.\u201d</p>\n        \n            \n    \n    \n    \n                            \n\n    \n            More Than a Third of Hotels Used to Shelter Homeless People Were Out of Date on Social Services Inspections as of October 2024\n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Data Source: Analysis of Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance data on inspections of hotels and motels used for emergency shelter.\n    \n            (Lucas Waldron/ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n            \n        \n    \n                    \n<p>New York Focus and ProPublica found numerous examples of families with children living in sordid and dangerous conditions.

Yet data obtained from OTDA shows that many wind up behind schedule. As of October, about 40% of hotels were either out of date on their inspection or didn\u2019t have one listed. </p>\n\n<p>Farmer, the OTDA spokesperson, said that nearly all hotels were inspected within a year, and that some had stopped accepting welfare recipients.</p>\n\n<p>Guinn, the commissioner, said that OTDA will formally propose rules this year clarifying that people in hotels must receive the same services as they would receive in shelters.

Often she begins her testimony by explaining her subspeciality: child abuse pediatrics, which focuses on the diagnosis and documentation of signs of child abuse. Her role, she often reminds judges and juries, is solely medical. Whether or not to remove a child from their home, terminate the parent\u2019s rights or, in the most serious cases, charge a caregiver criminally is not up to her.</p>\n\n<p>According to Harper\u2019s testimony, she and her team at the Otto Bremer Trust Center for Safe and Healthy Children in Minneapolis handle about 700 cases of suspected abuse each year. She has testified that 10% to 20% of those wind up confirmed for physical abuse, although it is difficult to determine if these figures are accurate since child protection cases are not public.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/child-abuse-pediatrician-minneapolis-nancy-harper-cps\">When Harper, the center\u2019s director, and her team diagnose abuse, parents and caregivers often struggle to challenge those opinions.</a> By Harper\u2019s own estimation, she\u2019s never been wrong.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a case where I thought it was abusive head trauma and the other specialist didn\u2019t,\u201d Harper testified in 2023, in the case of a day care provider charged with the death of a child in her care.</p>\n\n<p>The defense attorney in the case pressed her: \u201cHave you ever incorrectly diagnosed a child with abusive head trauma?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNot currently to my recollection,\u201d she answered.</p>\n\n<p>But in a handful of cases, judges and juries have found day care providers and parents not guilty of crimes after Harper has testified that abuse occurred, though a verdict cannot necessarily be interpreted as a repudiation of Harper or any other expert witness\u2019 determinations or credibility.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Additionally, two federal lawsuits filed recently accuse Harper of ignoring or even concealing alternative explanations for children\u2019s injuries. And, more broadly, medical and legal experts are increasingly questioning a leading child abuse diagnosis, shaken baby syndrome, which is <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/shaken-baby-syndrome-abusive-head-trauma-controversy\">also known as abusive head trauma</a>.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>Harper did not respond to requests for comment. She has yet to respond to either lawsuit. In past court testimony, Harper has said that both shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma are considered scientifically valid diagnoses by the mainstream medical community. Any controversy, she has said, exists primarily in the legal world rather than the medical one.</p>\n\n<p>Kathleen Pakes, a former prosecutor who now specializes in the forensics of child abuse cases for the Office of the Wisconsin State Public Defender, said Harper\u2019s claim of never making an incorrect diagnosis strains credulity.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere is no other specialty in medicine that has zero error rate. None,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>Below are four cases in which Harper concluded there was abuse but courts or juries determined otherwise.</p>\n\n\n<p>On July 12, 2017, an 11-month-old boy named Gabriel Cooper collapsed in his high chair at the day care that Sylwia Pawlak-Reynolds operated in South Minneapolis. Paramedics took him to Hennepin County Medical Center, where he was declared brain dead a day later.</p>\n\n<p>Harper reviewed Cooper\u2019s medical records and wrote that \u201cin the absence of a well-documented consistent severe accidental injury, non-accidental trauma or abusive head trauma remains the primary diagnostic consideration.\u201d The child, she wrote, was essentially shaken to death. Before any criminal charges were filed, Pawlak-Reynolds boarded a plane for her native Poland to care for her ailing father, according to her attorney. In February 2018, prosecutors charged Pawlak-Reynolds with two counts of second-degree murder, citing Harper\u2019s diagnosis.</p>\n\n<p>According to her husband, Will Reynolds, they did not realize Pawlak-Reynolds was pregnant when she boarded her flight to Poland. She remained there to give birth to their third child, who is now 6, while Reynolds remained in Minnesota with their two older children, who are now 13 and 16. Reynolds said he and his wife have no confidence that she will get a fair trial, and that she fears she will lose custody of their youngest child if she reenters the country. The family has now been separated for eight years.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Sylwia Pawlak-Reynolds\u2019 husband, Will Reynolds, remains in Minnesota with their two older children.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Early in the case, Pawlak-Reynolds\u2019 attorneys obtained the same copy of Cooper\u2019s hospital records that had been provided to Minneapolis police, which included the paramedics\u2019 report. The document had been printed out at a significantly reduced scale, shrinking the text to the point that some fields were illegible. Two years later, they obtained a second copy, printed at normal size, which revealed a possible alternate explanation for the injuries: \u201cMom recalls [patient] did fall 2 days ago, striking the back of his head.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat was the sort of proverbial silver-bullet evidence that we\u2019re always looking for in every case and usually never find,\u201d said Brock Hunter, Pawlak-Reynolds\u2019 lawyer.</p>\n\n<p>Polish courts, including an appeals court, have denied extradition requests from the U.S. three times, and the country\u2019s minister of justice has affirmed the rulings. The denials are particularly critical of Harper\u2019s assessment. Polish forensic experts evaluated the case records and took note of a finding by a neurology expert hired by Pawlak-Reynolds, who wrote that Cooper carried a gene tied to a blood clotting disorder.</p>\n\n<p>The ambulance report, the Polish judges wrote, \u201cwas concealed from the defense.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThen, after the fact was made public, it did not affect the actions of the American authorities in any way,\u201d a Polish district court judge wrote in 2022.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Hennepin Country Medical Center\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The Hennepin County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office certified Cooper\u2019s manner of death as \u201cundetermined\u201d and the date and place of injury \u201cunknown,\u201d a tacit disagreement with Harper\u2019s opinion that Cooper would have collapsed \u201cshortly after infliction of the trauma.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Hennepin County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p>Then in 2023, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty wrote to Pawlak-Reynolds\u2019 attorneys after meeting with them: \u201cWe agree that to resolve the current impasse regarding Ms. Pawlak-Reynolds, the best course for all involved is to dismiss the pending charges without prejudice, and for her to return to the United States.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But months later, Moriarty changed her mind.</p>\n\n<p>In a statement to ProPublica, a spokesperson for the Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office wrote that the office is completing a \u201cfinal, thorough review\u201d of the case that will include an evaluation of \u201cconcerns regarding the medical conclusions and the overall strength of the case.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Gabriel\u2019s parents, Joseph and Samantha Cooper, did not respond to requests for comment. <a href=\"https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/courts-news/hennepin-county-attorneys-office-final-review-of-2017-alleged-shaken-baby-case/89-a8396fe0-4cf2-4715-b467-0a7f5a70a4ef\">In a television interview in June</a>, they denied that Cooper struck the back of his head two days before his collapse. They said that they want justice for their son.</p>\n\n<p>Pawlak-Reynolds declined to comment through her attorney. In late February, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25978997-reynolds-amended-complaint-2025/\">her husband filed a federal lawsuit against Harper</a> that claims she \u201cknowingly and intentionally falsified, modified and erased exculpatory information\u201d from her evaluation of Cooper, and she diagnosed abusive head trauma to \u201cpromote her own personal, academic, reputational and financial needs.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Harper has yet to respond to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for Hennepin Healthcare, which operates Hennepin County Medical Center, declined to comment on the case or the lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere is no oversight,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cIt\u2019s the thing they\u2019re most resistant against and the thing that is most necessary to stop this legacy of brutality, that results in kids being taken away from innocent caregivers and innocent caregivers going to prison.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            An old photograph shows Pawlak-Reynolds and one of her children\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n\n<p>In August 2017, Kathryn Campbell called 911 after a 4-month-old girl at her day care seemed lethargic and was \u201cbreathing wrong.\u201d First responders did not take the baby to the hospital, but her mother eventually did. At the hospital, MRI scans showed fluid in the baby\u2019s brain and doctors noted small bruises.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Barbara Knox, a child abuse pediatrician then with the University of Wisconsin, told police it was \u201cobvious child abuse.\u201d The Dane County district attorney charged Campbell with physical abuse of a child. Campbell pleaded not guilty.</p>\n\n<p>But before the 2021 trial, Knox left the University of Wisconsin after she was placed on leave for \u201cunprofessional acts that may constitute retaliation\u201d and intimidation of her own staff. <a href=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/2020/02/child-abuse-doctor-bullying/\">A Wisconsin Watch investigation</a> cast doubt on Knox\u2019s judgment in several cases of alleged abuse.</p>\n\n<p>Knox did not respond to the Wisconsin Watch series or to ProPublica\u2019s requests for comment. After two families in Alaska <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25978979-knox-alaska-complaint-2022/\">sued her in 2022</a>, alleging she had wrongly concluded their children had been abused, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25979000-knox-affidavit-response-to-complaint-2022/\">Knox wrote in an affidavit</a> that she has no control over whether police and child protection services workers take children away from parents, that she did not \u201cconspire\u201d with police or anyone else on custody issues, and that she did not personally evaluate one of the children. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2024 after the families agreed to drop the matter.</p>\n\n<p>Knox moved on to a job at the University of Florida. According to a spokesperson for the university, Knox resigned as a pediatrician with the Child Protective Team in late June, effective Aug. 15. He declined to comment on the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>At Campbell\u2019s trial, Knox\u2019s name was never mentioned. Instead, Harper stepped in as an expert witness. When Campbell heard Knox had been replaced, she was initially hopeful.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m like, oh, great, new eyes,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to look at it and go, \u2018This is nuts, I don\u2019t agree with this.\u2019 And I definitely was wrong.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Harper\u2019s assessment affirmed Knox\u2019s diagnosis of abuse. She told the jury that the bruises were likely caused by squeezing by an adult\u2019s hand. A medical expert hired by Campbell\u2019s defense argued that the child\u2019s bleeding could not be precisely dated and that a preexisting medical condition could have caused it.</p>\n\n<p>After just two hours of deliberation, the jury returned a not guilty verdict. Campbell said she is grateful to have the case concluded, though she said she is still haunted by the accusations against her.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat was the hardest thing too, going home after this case was done, and being like, \u2018Am I allowed to be alone with my children now?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all because of the quote-unquote experts not doing their due diligence and looking further into underlying issues that these kids could have.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In a statement to ProPublica, Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne expressed confidence in both Harper and Knox, saying \u201ctheir testimony had been consistent with many different medical professionals and experts in their own areas of practice.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is important to note that a not guilty verdict by lay jurors hardly invalidates the widespread acceptance of abusive head trauma as a diagnosis in the medical community nor would it cause us to have concerns about Dr. Harper\u2019s qualifications or knowledge in the field,\u201d he added. \u201cJurors are not bound to accept any expert testimony as accurate.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<p>In the winter of 2022, a 4-month-old boy began breathing abnormally at his day care in Mineral Point, Wisconsin. His parents took him to a hospital, where he died days later. A police investigation determined that his day care provider, Joanna Ford, left him and several other children alone in her home for over an hour while she went to a tattoo and piercing parlor.</p>\n\n<p>Prosecutors used Harper as an expert witness in the case. After evaluating the child\u2019s medical records, she concluded that his injuries were \u201cclinically diagnostic of abusive head trauma,\u201d or, put another way, Ford shook the baby violently. She was charged with first-degree reckless homicide. Ford pleaded not guilty.</p>\n\n<p>Ford\u2019s defense lawyers successfully petitioned the judge in the case for a hearing to determine whether Harper\u2019s expert witness testimony would be scientifically valid and admissible at trial. In response to questions, Harper explained why the child\u2019s symptoms \u2014 brain swelling, blood under his skull, damage to his eyes \u2014 pointed to abuse, and why, despite the controversy surrounding it, the diagnosis of abusive head trauma was scientifically sound. She also explained that, because the baby was not walking or crawling, the fact that none of his caregivers could explain his injuries indicated abuse.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPeople should know what happened,\u201d she testified.</p>\n\n<p>On cross examination by Ford\u2019s lawyers, Harper said she couldn\u2019t say for certain what time the abuse would have occurred, exactly how Ford had injured the baby and that there are no \u201cgreat biomechanical models\u201d for shaken baby syndrome.</p>\n\n<p>A little over a month later, Judge Lisa McDougal delivered a highly critical ruling that barred Harper from telling the jury that the child died as the result of \u201cabusive head trauma, non-accidental injury, child abuse or murder.\u201d She also took issue with the idea that a lack of explanation for injuries is indicative of abuse, calling it a \u201cleap in logic.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOffering a conclusive opinion as to how an injury may have occurred crosses a line and does not fit within the dictionary definition of what diagnosis is,\u201d McDougal said. The judge also said that Harper views herself as an advocate, and that that casts doubt on her \u201cfidelity to the scientific validation of abusive head trauma diagnoses, especially when it is a close call.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The murder charge was dismissed. For leaving the children alone, Ford pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of neglect of a child where the consequence is death. She is serving a 10-year prison sentence. Ford, through her attorney, declined a request for an interview. The Iowa County district attorney also declined to comment.</p>\n\n\n<p>On Feb. 4, 2022, Paul and Sarah Marshall hosted a dinner for her parents and a family friend at their home in Hudson, Wisconsin. Afterward, their 7-week-old son, Fox, became fussy. Paul Marshall carried him into the mother-in-law unit on the lower level of the house, which was cool and dark, to try to calm him. He emerged minutes later in a panic, yelling that the baby spit up and stopped breathing.</p>\n\n<p>Paramedics rushed Fox to Children\u2019s Minnesota, a hospital about 25 minutes across the state border in St. Paul. Doctors ran tests, and a scan showed Fox had a skull fracture with fluid pooling on both sides of his brain. He died days later. </p>\n\n<p>Harper examined Fox, as well as his twin sister, Liana, and found \u201cskull fractures, likely rib fractures, metaphyseal fractures.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis constellation of findings in a nonambulatory infant is clinically diagnostic of inflicted injury or child physical abuse likely occurring on more than one occasion,\u201d she wrote.</p>\n\n<p>But the Marshalls said that wasn\u2019t true. They told Harper that Sarah Marshall had experienced a difficult pregnancy with gestational diabetes and severe anemia, and that Liana had a vacuum-assisted delivery. Both twins had been to their regular pediatrician over health concerns. While Liana\u2019s health improved, Fox\u2019s had not.</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for Children\u2019s Minnesota declined to comment on the case.</p>\n\n<p>Because he was the last person alone with Fox before he stopped breathing, Paul Marshall was charged with first-degree reckless homicide. He was also charged with physical abuse of a child for hurting Liana. Sarah Marshall said there was no evidence that her soft-spoken husband had hurt their children.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe state wanted to cast me as a naive idiot,\u201d she said. \u201cI chose not to believe it because of the logic and facts in my face. I had no reason to believe the accusation.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>At Paul Marshall\u2019s 2023 trial, his defense lawyer, Aaron Nelson, cross-examined the other doctors who treated or evaluated Fox and Liana, and was able to highlight points of medical disagreement. A doctor who tested Liana for genetic disorders said she could not rule out rickets as a possible cause of her bone fractures. A neuropathologist did not agree with Harper that Fox had a trauma-induced blood clotting disorder. By Harper\u2019s own admission on cross-examination, determining the age of the skull fractures in children Fox and Liana\u2019s age was difficult. Nelson called six of his own medical experts to suggest that the difficult birth or a vitamin deficiency could explain the twins\u2019 injuries.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow many people have to be wrong for Dr. Harper to be right?\u201d Nelson said in closing arguments.</p>\n\n<p>After an 11-day trial, the jury found Marshall not guilty.</p>\n\n<p>In a statement to ProPublica, St. Croix County District Attorney Karl Anderson pointed out that Harper was not the only treating physician who was concerned that Fox and Liana had been abused.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA not guilty verdict does not mean that the jury concluded that the children were not abused,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cRather, it means that they did not conclude that the State proved that Paul Marshall caused the death, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n\n                            \n                                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n\n            Paul and Sarah Marshall with their children at home, which is decorated with memories of their son, Fox\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n            \n                    \n    \n                    \n<p>Six weeks after the trial, the family moved three hours away into a century-old farmhouse that is far from the community that they felt wrongfully villainized by.</p>\n\n<p>One of the cruelest impacts of the abuse diagnosis, they said, came after it was clear that Fox would die and the hospital staff began making preparations for his organs to be donated. Sarah Marshall said she had hoped to someday hear her son\u2019s heart beating in another child\u2019s chest. Instead, a court order put a halt to the procedure.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey were already treating him as evidence,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>The experience of going from a grieving parent to an accused murderer, her husband said, has given the couple post-traumatic stress. Paul Marshall said he is grateful to be with his wife and children, but what he calls a \u201cbroken system\u201d has left them unsure whether or not to have another baby or even be left alone with one of their daughters.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou get pregnant. You go to all of your appointments. You voice all of your concerns. You do everything you\u2019re supposed to do as a parent and your child still dies. And the state tells you it\u2019s your fault,\u201d Sarah Marshall said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why I live in a world like that.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/mariam-elba\">Mariam Elba</a> contributed research.</p>",

Reports now abound of doctors hesitating to provide them and women who are bleeding heavily being discharged from emergency rooms without care, only to return in such dire condition that they need blood transfusions to survive. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/porsha-ngumezi-miscarriage-death-texas-abortion-ban\">As ProPublica reported last year</a>, one woman died of hemorrhage after 10 hours in a Houston hospital that didn\u2019t perform the procedure.</p>\n\n<p>Now, a new ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-miscarriage-blood-transfusions-methodology\">data analysis</a> adds empirical weight to the mounting evidence that abortion bans have made the common experience of miscarriage \u2014 which occurs in up to 30% of pregnancies \u2014 far more dangerous. It is based on hospital discharge data from Texas, the largest state to ban abortion, and captures emergency department visits from 2017 to 2023, the most recent year available.</p>\n\n<p>After Texas made performing abortions a felony in August 2022, ProPublica found, the number of blood transfusions during emergency room visits for first-trimester miscarriage shot up by 54%.</p>\n\n<p>The number of emergency room visits for early miscarriage also rose, by 25%, compared with the three years before the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 a sign that women who didn\u2019t receive D&amp;Cs initially may be returning to hospitals in worse condition, more than a dozen experts told ProPublica. </p>\n\n<p>While that phenomenon can\u2019t be confirmed by the discharge data, which tracks visits rather than individuals, doctors and researchers who reviewed ProPublica\u2019s findings say these spikes, along with the stories patients have shared, paint a troubling picture of the harm that results from unnecessary delays in care.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is striking,\u201d said Dr. Elliott Main, a hemorrhage expert and former medical director for the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative. \u201cThe trend is very clear.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n            Blood Transfusions in First-trimester Pregnancy Loss ER Visits Spiked After Texas Banned Abortion\n                <p>After the state\u2019s first abortion ban went into effect in September 2021, blood transfusions increased. After abortion became a felony in August 2022, they increased more.</p>\n\n    \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Note: For emergency department visits involving a pregnancy loss at less than 13 weeks gestation, or with an unknown gestational week.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The data mirrors <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-abortion-ban-sepsis-maternal-mortality-analysis\">a sharp rise in cases of sepsis \u2014 a life-threatening reaction to infection \u2014 ProPublica previously identified during second-trimester miscarriage in Texas</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Blood loss is expected during early miscarriage, which usually ends without complication. Some cases, however, can turn deadly very quickly. Main said ProPublica\u2019s analysis suggested to him that \u201cphysicians are sitting on nonviable pregnancies longer and longer before they\u2019re doing a D&amp;C \u2014 until patients are really bleeding.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s what happened to Sarah De Pablos Velez in Austin last summer. As she was miscarrying and bleeding profusely, she said physicians didn\u2019t explain that she had options for care. Sent home from the emergency room without a D&amp;C two times, she ultimately needed blood transfusions so that she wouldn\u2019t die, according to medical records. \u201cWhat happened to me was just so wrong,\u201d she told ProPublica. \"Doctors need to be providing care to pregnant women \u2014 that needs to be a baseline.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Sarah De Pablos Velez was sent home from an emergency room while bleeding profusely during a miscarriage last year; she ultimately needed blood transfusions to save her life.\n    \n            (Ilana Panich-Linsman for ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>After ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/josseli-barnica-death-miscarriage-texas-abortion-ban\">exposed preventable deaths</a> following <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/nevaeh-crain-death-texas-abortion-ban-emtala\">delays in care</a>, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-senate-abortion-ban-legislation-medical-exceptions\">the Texas Legislature passed a bill</a> this year to clarify that doctors can provide abortions when a patient is facing a life-threatening emergency, even if it is not imminent. </p>\n\n<p>But many Texas doctors say the reform does not address the difficulty of treating women experiencing early miscarriages, which almost always involve blood loss; they say it\u2019s hard to know when the expected bleeding might evolve into a life-threatening emergency \u2014 one that could have been prevented with a D&amp;C. Women can bleed and remain stable for a long time, until they crash. </p>\n\n<p>Texas forbids abortion at all stages of pregnancy \u2014 even before there is cardiac activity or a visible embryo. And while the law allows doctors to \u201cremove a dead, unborn child,\u201d it can be difficult to determine what that means during early miscarriage, when an array of factors can signal that a pregnancy is not progressing.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>An embryo might fail to develop. Cardiac activity may not emerge when it should. Hormone levels might dip or bleeding might increase. Even if a doctor strongly suspects a miscarriage is underway, it can take weeks to conclusively document that a pregnancy has ended, and all the while, a patient might be losing blood. </p>\n\n<p>Some OB-GYNs and emergency room physicians have long been advising patients to complete their miscarriage at home, especially at Catholic hospitals, even if that is not the standard of care. But now, physicians across the state are faced with a law that threatens up to 99 years in prison, and more are making a new calculus around whether to intervene or even tell patients they are likely miscarrying, said Dr. Anitra Beasley, an OB-GYN in Houston. \u201cWhat ends up happening is patients have to present multiple times before a diagnosis can be made,\u201d she added, and some of those patients wind up needing blood transfusions.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>While they can be lifesaving, transfusions do not stop the bleeding, experts told ProPublica, and they can introduce complications, such as severe allergic reactions, autoimmune disorders or, in rare events, blood cancer. The dangers of hemorrhage are far greater, from organ failure to kidney damage to loss of sensation in the fingers and toes. \u201cThere\u2019s a finite amount of blood,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Prager, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington. \u201cAnd when it all comes out, you\u2019re dead.\u201d   </p>\n\n<p>ProPublica\u2019s findings about the rise in blood transfusions make clear that women who experience early miscarriages in abortion ban states are living in a more dangerous medical climate than many believe, said Amanda Nagle, a doctoral student investigating the same blood transfusion data for a forthcoming paper in the American Journal of Public Health. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf people are seeking care at an emergency department,\u201d Nagle said, \u201cthere are serious health risks to delaying that care.\u201d</p>\n\nWaiting for Certainty\n<p>In some clinics and hospitals across Texas, the pressure to definitively diagnose a miscarriage  has led to delays in offering D&amp;Cs. </p>\n\n<p>Considering the chance of criminal prosecution, some doctors now default to what many pregnancy loss experts view as an overly cautious method for diagnosing miscarriage: ultrasound images alone, using criteria from the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound. Relying only on images to diagnose \u2014 and discounting other factors, like lab results or clinical symptoms \u2014 can take days or even weeks.  </p>\n\n<p>Dr. Gabrielle Taper was a resident at a Catholic hospital in Austin when the ban was enacted, and a culture of fear took hold among her colleagues, she told ProPublica. \u201cWe started asking, \u2018Are we certain that we can document that we\u2019ve met the radiology guidelines?\u2019 as opposed to just treating the patient in front of us,\u201d she said.  </p>\n\n<p>If they couldn\u2019t show that the likely miscarriage met the criteria, they often felt they had to discharge patients without offering a D&amp;C. \u201cPeople are already in distress, and you are giving them confusion, a false sense of hope,\u201d she told ProPublica. \u201cHaving to send a patient home knowing they may bleed so much they would need a blood transfusion \u2014 when I know there are procedures I could do or medicine I could offer \u2014 is just excruciating.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The hospital where she worked did not respond to ProPublica\u2019s request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend this approach, advising doctors instead to review the ultrasound as one piece of information among many and counsel patients on all their options. </p>\n\n<p>The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound said that the guidelines \u201care not meant to apply in the setting of a life-threatening situation, such as heavy bleeding,\u201d but did not respond to a question about whether it agreed with ACOG that doctors should use a combination of ultrasound images and clinical judgment to assess a pregnancy loss. </p>\n\n<p>Dr. Courtney A. Schreiber, an obstetrics and gynecology professor and expert in early pregnancy care, said that even if a patient wants to let a likely miscarriage complete at home, the medical team should still explain different management options, including medication to speed up the process or a D&amp;C, should symptoms like bleeding get worse. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s our obligation to share information, help manage expectations and keep women safe,\u201d she said.  </p>\n\n<p>What happened to <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/porsha-ngumezi-miscarriage-death-texas-abortion-ban\">Porsha Ngumezi</a> shows how dangerous it can be to delay care, according to more than a dozen doctors who previously reviewed a detailed summary of her case for ProPublica. </p>\n\n<p>When the mother of two showed up bleeding at Houston Methodist Sugar Land in June 2023, at 11 weeks pregnant, her sonogram suggested an \u201congoing miscarriage\u201d was \u201clikely,\u201d her doctor noted. She had no previous ultrasounds to compare it with, and the radiologist did not locate an embryo or fetus \u2014 which Ngumezi said she thought she had passed in a toilet; her doctors did not make a definitive diagnosis, calling it a pregnancy of \u201cunknown location.\u201d After hours bleeding, passing \u201cclots the size of grapefruit,\u201d according to a nurse\u2019s notes, she received two blood transfusions \u2014 a short-term remedy. But she did not get a procedure to empty her uterus, which medical experts agree is the most effective way to stop the bleeding. Hours later, she died of hemorrhage, leaving behind her husband and young sons.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Hope Ngumezi holds a photograph of him and his late wife, Porsha, who died in a Houston hospital during a miscarriage in June 2023.\n    \n            (Danielle Villasana for ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Doctors and nurses involved in Ngumezi\u2019s care did not respond to multiple requests for comment for ProPublica\u2019s story last fall, and the hospital did not answer questions about her care when asked about it again for this story. A spokesperson from Methodist Hospital said its OB-GYNs follow ACOG\u2019s miscarriage diagnosis guidelines, which recommend considering clinical factors in addition to ultrasounds.  </p>\n\nVisit After Visit\n<p>Even in circumstances in which the abortion ban allows a doctor to intervene \u2014 to treat a life-threatening emergency, for example, or to \u201cremove a dead, unborn baby\u201d \u2014  there\u2019s plenty of evidence, detailed in <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/case/zurawski-v-texas-abortion-emergency-exceptions/zurawski-v-texas/\">lawsuits</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-texas-hospital-doomed-pregnancy-discharge-308ea695a17f72500cbf31622fdb521a\">federal investigations</a>, that doctors in Texas still aren\u2019t offering procedures.   </p>\n\n<p>As soon as Sarah De Pablos Velez, a 30-year-old media director, learned she was pregnant last summer, she began attending regular checkups at St. David\u2019s Women\u2019s Care, in Austin. During her third appointment at about nine weeks, a resident, Dr. Carla Vilardo, and her supervisor, Dr. Cynthia Mingea, reviewed the ultrasound, according to medical records, which indicated her pregnancy wasn\u2019t viable. Instead of being offered treatment for a miscarriage, De Pablos Velez says she was advised to hold out hope and come back for the next checkup. </p>\n\n<p>Five maternal health experts and practicing OB-GYNs who reviewed the records for ProPublica said by that ultrasound visit, doctors would have had enough information to determine that the pregnancy wasn\u2019t viable, even under the most conservative guidelines. If they wanted to be extra sure, they could have done blood work or one more ultrasound during that visit.  </p>\n\n<p>Instead, De Pablos Velez was told to come back in two weeks, according to medical records. During a visit when she should have been nearly 11 weeks pregnant, Mingea wrote in her chart she was \u201cnot optimistic\u201d about the pregnancy's viability. Still, De Pablos Velez was advised to return in another week to be sure. </p>\n\n<p>Within a few days, when the cramping got so bad she could barely walk, De Pablos Velez went to the emergency room at St. David\u2019s Medical Center, unaware that a D&amp;C could stop the pain and the bleeding. \u201cI\u2019ve never researched what it looks like for women who have a miscarriage,\u201d she told ProPublica. \u201cI always thought you go to the bathroom and have a little bit of blood.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Over two visits to the emergency room, doctors told her that she could complete the miscarriage at home, even as she reported filling up three toilet bowls with blood and a nurse remarked that they needed a janitor to clean the floor, De Pablos Velez and her husband recalled. No obstetrician ever came to assess her condition, according to medical records, and while her hospital chart says \u201call management options have been discussed with the patient and her husband,\u201d De Pablos Velez and her husband both told ProPublica no one offered her a D&amp;C. </p>\n\n<p>She was told to follow up with her OB at her next appointment in three days. Six hours after discharge, though, she was trying to ride out the pain at home when her husband heard her muttering \u201clightheaded\u201d in the bathroom and ran to her in time to catch her as she collapsed. \u201cShe was pale as a ghost, sweating, convulsing,\u201d said her husband, Sergio De Pablos Velez. \u201cThere was blood on the toilet, the trash can \u2014 like a scene out of a horror movie.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>An ambulance rushed her to the hospital, where doctors realized she no longer had enough blood flowing to her organs. She received two blood transfusions. Without them, several doctors who reviewed her records told ProPublica, she would have soon lost her life.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            De Pablos Velez and her husband, Sergio, at home in Austin\n    \n            (Ilana Panich-Linsman for ProPublica)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Vilardo and the doctors who saw De Pablos Velez in the emergency room did not respond to requests to speak with ProPublica or declined to be interviewed. St. David\u2019s Medical Center, which is owned by HCA, the largest for-profit hospital chain in America, said it could not discuss her case unless she signed privacy waivers. The hospital did not respond to ProPublica\u2019s questions even after she submitted them. The De Pablos Velezes say that a hospital patient liaison told them after the ordeal that the hospital would conduct an internal investigation, educate the emergency department on best practices and share the results. It never shared anything. When ProPublica asked about the status of the investigation, neither the liaison nor the hospital responded. </p>\n\n<p>Mingea, who supervised Vilardo\u2019s care during checkups, reviewed the clinic\u2019s records with ProPublica and agreed that De Pablos Velez should have been counseled about miscarriage management options at the clinic, weeks before she ended up in the ER. She said she did not know why she wasn\u2019t but pointed ProPublica to the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound criteria, which is hanging on the clinic\u2019s wall and is used to teach residents.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>She was adamant that her clinic, which she described as \u201cvery pro-choice \u2014 about as much as we can be in Texas,\u201d regularly provides D&amp;Cs for miscarrying patients. \u201cI feel badly that Sarah had this experience, I really do,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody deserves to be counseled about all their options.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Doctors had five opportunities to counsel De Pablos Velez about her options and offer her a D&amp;C, said Dr. Jodi Abbott, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine, who reviewed case records. If they had, the life-or-death risks could have been avoided.</p>\n\n<p>De Pablos Velez \u201cbasically received the same care Porsha Ngumezi did, only Porsha died and she survived,\u201d said Abbott. \u201cShe was lucky.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/sophie-chou\">Sophie Chou</a> contributed data reporting, and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/mariam-elba\">Mariam Elba</a> contributed research.</p>",

The need to explore this phase is urgent, experts told ProPublica, given the way state abortion bans have disrupted maternal health care. </p>\n\n<p>Although most early miscarriages resolve without complications, patients with heavy bleeding can hemorrhage if they don\u2019t get appropriate treatment \u2014 which includes a procedure called dilation and curettage, or D&amp;C, that is now tangled up in legislation that bans abortion. As women recounted being left to lose dangerous amounts of blood, and ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/porsha-ngumezi-miscarriage-death-texas-abortion-ban\">told the story of a mother who died in a Houston hospital while seeking miscarriage care</a>, reporters searched for a way to gain a broader understanding of what was happening in the state. </p>\n\n<p>We consulted dozens of researchers and clinicians to develop our methodology and understand how to look at early miscarriage outcomes in the emergency department.</p>\n\n<p>Our latest analysis, of hospital discharge data from Texas, found that after the state made performing abortions a felony in August 2022, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-abortion-ban-miscarriage-blood-transfusions\">the number of blood transfusions during emergency room visits</a> for first-trimester miscarriage shot up by 54%.</p>\n\n<p>The number of emergency room visits during first-trimester miscarriage also rose by 25%, a sign that women may be returning to hospitals in worse condition after being sent home, more than a dozen experts told ProPublica.</p>\n\n<p>Experts say the spike is a troubling indicator of delays in care.  </p>\n\n<p>The most effective way to prevent severe blood loss during miscarriages, experts said, is a D&amp;C, which uses suction to remove remaining tissue, allowing the uterus to close. The procedure is also used to terminate pregnancies.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Elliott Main, an expert on maternal hemorrhage and the former medical director for the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, said the increase in transfusions suggested to him that doctors working under abortion bans are now delaying those interventions for miscarrying patients for longer \u2014 \u201cuntil they\u2019re really bleeding.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>These findings add to ProPublica\u2019s growing body of reporting revealing that maternal outcomes have gotten worse after the state\u2019s abortion bans. In February, we published an analysis of second-trimester pregnancy loss hospitalizations, which found that <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-maternal-mortality-analysis-methodology\">the rate of sepsis climbed by more than 50% after the state banned abortion</a>. That study focused only on inpatient stays in Texas hospitals. However, many of the clinicians and researchers we spoke with told us that that focus would limit what we could say about miscarriage care earlier in pregnancy; most people experiencing first-trimester pregnancy complications would likely be seen in a shorter emergency department visit, rather than an inpatient stay.</p>\n\n<p>This methodology lays out the steps we took to examine early miscarriage outcomes in the emergency department, to help experts and interested readers understand our approach and its limitations.</p>\n\nIdentifying First-Trimester Emergency Visits\n<p>We purchased seven years of discharge records for inpatient and outpatient encounters at hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers from the Texas Department of State Health Services. These records contain deidentified data for visits, with information about the encounter, including diagnoses recorded and procedures performed, as well as some patient demographic information and billing data.</p>\n\n<p>We limited our analysis to visits with a diagnosed pregnancy loss across both the inpatient and outpatient datasets. We followed a methodology that maternal health researchers have used for many years to identify \u201cabortive outcomes\u201d \u2014 instances of pregnancy loss at less than 20 weeks, which includes diagnoses like ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage. Researchers have typically identified these cases in order to exclude them from metrics assessing complications in childbirth. In contrast, we focused our analysis only on those encounters with a pregnancy loss diagnosis. Medical experts suggested that it's possible more women are self-managing abortions at home; since a self-managed medication abortion would present like a spontaneous miscarriage, however, we can\u2019t differentiate those patients in our data.</p>\n\n<p>We also limited our analysis to either emergency department visits or inpatient stays that began in the emergency department. The state\u2019s outpatient data also includes encounters for outpatient procedures and data for ambulatory surgery centers, which we excluded to focus on emergent hospital care. Ultimately, our analysis focused on 35,500 first-trimester visits per year that came into hospitals through the emergency department, excluding a small number (about 1,400 per year) of inpatient stays that did not begin in the emergency room.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>To limit our analysis to pregnancy loss in the first trimester, we looked for a diagnosis code indicating gestational weeks. In cases where a long hospitalization had multiple gestational week codes recorded over the course of the stay, we took the latest one. We excluded any row that had a gestational week code of 13 weeks or more, which marks the start of the second trimester. The vast majority \u2014 78% \u2014 of emergency department visits for pregnancy loss had a code indicating unknown gestational week or no gestational week diagnosis code at all. We included those visits in the first-trimester category. Clinicians told us that a pregnant patient coming to the emergency department in her first trimester is less likely to have had a doctor\u2019s appointment establishing gestational age. Since pregnancy loss in the second or third trimester is more serious, and because it is easier to establish gestational age in a pregnancy that is further along, an emergency department doctor would likely be able to establish a gestational age over the course of treatment in those cases.</p>\n\n<p>We then filtered our list of visits to ones where the patient was female and between the ages of 10 and 54, to exclude rows with potential errors. This removed 2,692 visits, or 1.1% of all visits we\u2019d identified.</p>\n\n<p>The number of emergency department first-trimester hospitalizations were relatively stable prior to COVID-19. In 2022, the first full year after the state passed its six-week abortion ban, the number of encounters jumped by 11%. And in 2023, the year after the state criminalized abortion, they rose again, increasing by 25% from pre-COVID levels.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>While we could identify an increase in visits, we could not identify patients across visits, which means we can\u2019t say how many of these visits represent the same person returning to the emergency department multiple times for the same pregnancy loss. Texas has seen an increase in live births since the state banned abortion \u2014 about 2.7% in 2022, compared with the pre-COVID average, and declining slightly in 2023. But this increase in births \u2014 and, by extension, pregnancies \u2014 does not explain the rate of change in emergency visits, which far surpasses it.</p>\n\n<p>Clinicians also told us that the threshold for diagnosing pregnancy loss increased after the state banned abortion. To assess how many relevant visits our analysis might be leaving out, and whether we were missing more visits after hospital policy changes, we looked for visits without a pregnancy loss code but with a diagnosis of \u201cthreatened abortion\u201d or \u201cearly pregnancy hemorrhage,\u201d indicating uterine cramping or bleeding in early pregnancy. Since clinicians told us that these diagnoses might range from light spotting to significant bleeding, and since bleeding in pregnancy is common and does not always indicate a miscarriage in progress, we did not include these visits in our main analysis. However, we also identified a 23% increase in visits with those codes \u2014 from an annual average of 70,936 prior to COVID to 87,431 in 2023.</p>\n\nIdentifying Transfusions\n<p>Next, we identified pregnancy loss visits with a transfusion, which typically indicates that there has been a dangerous loss of blood.</p>\n\n<p>For our inpatient dataset, where procedures performed during a hospitalization were recorded as ICD-10-PCS codes, we identified visits with a blood transfusion using a list of codes <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-infant-health/php/severe-maternal-morbidity/icd.html\">defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. The outpatient dataset, which uses Current Procedural Terminology codes, has just one code \u2014 36430 \u2014 for blood transfusions.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to COVID-19, there were 840 first-trimester pregnancy loss emergency department visits each year, on average, with a blood transfusion. In 2022, the first full year after the state passed its first abortion ban, transfusions climbed to 1,076 \u2014 an increase of 28% from pre-COVID years. By 2023, the first full year after abortion was criminalized, that number climbed to 1,290 \u2014 an increase of 54% compared to pre-COVID. That\u2019s 450 more visits with a blood transfusion in 2023 than the pre-COVID average.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n            Blood Transfusions in First-trimester Pregnancy Loss ER Visits Spiked After Texas Banned Abortion\n                <p>After the state\u2019s first abortion ban went into effect in September 2021, blood transfusions increased. After abortion became a felony in August 2022, they increased more.</p>\n\n    \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Note: For emergency department visits involving a pregnancy loss at less than 13 weeks gestation, or with an unknown gestational week.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Even as the number of visits to the emergency department increased, the proportion of those visits with a transfusion also went up, from 2.5% in pre-COVID years to 2.8% in 2022 and 3% in 2023 \u2014 suggesting that the increase in transfusions may not be explained by an increase in encounters alone.</p>\n\n<p>Experts who reviewed ProPublica\u2019s data wondered if the increase in transfusions might be driven by more women experiencing complications of ectopic or molar pregnancies, rare nonviable pregnancies in which the likelihood of a blood transfusion is much higher than for a spontaneous miscarriage. The data did not bear this out. When we excluded visits with ectopic and molar pregnancy diagnoses, the increase in the number of pregnancy loss transfusions was even higher \u2014 it rose by 61% by 2023.</p>\n\n<p>To understand whether there were increases in the numbers of transfusions in other maternal visits over the same time period, we also looked at blood transfusions in delivery events, using the federal methodology to identify birth complications. In hospital births, the number of transfusions increased by 6.7% in 2022 and 9.9% in 2023 compared with the pre-COVID average \u2014 an increase, but smaller in magnitude than the increase in first-trimester pregnancy loss hospitalizations.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/sophie-chou\">Sophie Chou</a> contributed data reporting.</p>",

This [FY \u201826] includes $848.3 billion for DoD's [Defense Department\u2019s] discretionary budget and $113.3 billion in mandatory funding for DoD via [the FY \u201925] reconciliation [bill now before the Senate] totaling $961.6 billion total for the Department of Defense.\u201d</p><p>That was a Senior DoD Official briefing reporters last Thursday, on newly-released details of the Trump administration\u2019s defense budget request for the fiscal year 2026, which begins October 1, 2025 and ends September 30, 2026.</p><p>In the best of times, the DoD budget process is difficult to understand, but this year it is even more complicated than most. The final defense budget figure depends not only on passage of the FY 2026 Appropriations Bill, but also on the FY 2025 reconciliations bill.</p><p>In addition, there are some interesting differences among the Pentagon, House and Senate on how the money is to be spent.</p><p>Ideally, a President sends his annual budget proposal to Congress early in the year\u2014late January for example. Congress holds authorization hearings followed by appropriation hearings, and the bills get marked up and passed before the next federal government fiscal year begins on October 1.</p><p>But when it comes to defense, for 11 of the past 12 fiscal years, DoD has had to operate under continuing resolutions (CRs) for some months because Congress in those years was unable to pass the necessary defense appropriations bills until after the new fiscal year began.</p><p>From DoD\u2019s point of view, that has caused problems because under CRs spending levels normally remain the same as the previous year. CRs also prohibit new starts, disrupt production schedules and generally interfere with defense planning. The situation becomes even more complicated in years of presidential transition.</p><p>The fiscal 2025 defense budget was originally put together under the Biden administration. Congress, after President Trump was elected, delayed passage of the Biden fiscal 2025 defense spending plan, approving two short-term CRs. Finally, after Trump became president, Congress approved a full year CR in mid-March 2025. That put DoD funding for this current fiscal year at $852 billion, just one percent above what it was in FY 2024.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Trump administration was working with DoD officials on the FY 2026 defense budget, which the Biden administration back in 2024, had projected would be $876.8 billion.</p><p>Then, on April 7, 2025, during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump, after mentioning that he had built up the U.S. military during his first term in office, suddenly said, \u201cWe have great things happening with our military.\u201d</p><p>Trump went on to say something that he had not said publicly before: \u201cWe also essentially approved a budget\u2026you'll like to hear this, of a trillion dollars, $1 trillion and nobody's seen anything like it. We have to build our military and we're very cost conscious, but the military is something that we have to build and we have to be strong because you got a lot of bad forces out there now. So, we're going to be approving a budget and I'm proud to say, actually the biggest one we've ever done for the military.\u201d</p><p>Trump\u2019s statement about $1 trillion for defense in FY 2026 then became the marching order, but how to do it was the question. A month later, the answer appeared publicly in the form of the FY 2025 reconciliation bill.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA. The world's leading minds on national security from both the public and private sectors will be there. Will you? </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcbconference.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apply for a seat at the table today.</strong></a></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em></em></p><p>Since the January presidential inauguration, the Trump administration and Republican leadership had been working on this reconciliation bill in order to change much of the Biden FY 2025 budgeting by aligning all spending, taxes, revenue, and the debt limit with a new, agreed-upon FY 2025 Trump budget.</p><p>Among many features of this FY 2025 Trump reconciliation bill was the insertion of a $150 billion lump sum for defense programs, to be paid out of U.S. Treasury funds available through 2029. There had been no congressional hearings\u2014the number just appeared.</p><p>In early May, when Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released its full government fiscal 2026 \u2018skinny\u2019 budget, public mention was first made of the $150 billion defense package in the reconciliation bill -- and that some $113 billion of it was to be earmarked for the Pentagon\u2019s fiscal 2026 budget.</p><p>That meant DoD\u2019s FY 2026 base budget remained near FY 2025\u2019s $852 billion, but you reached Trump\u2019s announced $1 trillion for overall defense spending by adding the $113 billion in the reconciliation bill along with funds for nuclear weapons paid for by the Energy Department.</p><p>Back in May, at the time of that OMB announcement, Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) said, \u201cFor the defense budget, OMB has requested a fifth year straight of Biden administration funding, leaving military spending flat, which is a cut in real terms\u2026I have said for months that reconciliation Defense spending does not replace the need for real growth in the military's base budget.\u201d</p><p>He was joined at that time by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky), the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, who said, \u201cMake no mistake: a one-time influx reconciliation spending is not a substitute for full-year appropriations.\u201d</p><p>On May 22, in a 215-to-214, largely party-line vote, the House passed its version of the FY 2025 reconciliation bill, containing the $150 billion defense package. The reconciliation bill is now up for debate in the Senate. An advantage for the Trump administration in the reconciliation process is that Senate rules allow for a simple majority vote (51 votes) for reconciliation bills, bypassing the usual 60-vote threshold on controversial measures needed to overcome a filibuster.</p><p>Meanwhile, House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees have held hearings on the Trump fiscal 2026 DoD budget request with mixed results.</p><p>On June 12, the House Appropriations Committee passed its version of the FY 2026 DoD funding bill that followed the OMB May proposal, keeping the numbers close to the FY 2025 level and reaching the $1 billion Trump goal by adding the earmarked $113 billion in the pending FY 2025 reconciliation bill.</p><p>However, questions were raised at the June 18 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was one of the witnesses.</p><p>Chairman Wicker said, \u201cWhat we have in front of us is an inadequate budget request with precious little detail and no follow on data about fiscal years 2027, 2028, or 2029. We must assume, and in fact we have heard, that OMB intends to maintain defense spending at $893 billion across the four years of this administration. So even with a one-time $150 billion [fiscal 2025] reconciliation [bill] infusion, this would leave us at 2.65% of GDP by 2029, below 3 percent of GDP and well below the 5 percent of GDP that we really need.\u201d</p><p>Wicker went on, \u201cI understand that if you put reconciliation and the budget request together for this year [FY2026] it exceeds 3 percent, but if we go back to that same baseline for the next three years, after that we'll be under 3 percent. Do you intend to fix that?\u201d</p><p>Hegseth agreed that going below 3 percent would be very dangerous, adding, \u201cSo does the President of the United States which is why this budget increases from FY25 1.3 percent [if you include reconciliation bill\u2019s $113 billion] and puts us at 3.5 percent of GDP on defense.\u201d</p><p>President Trump recently returned from the NATO summit at The Hague where he took credit for the allies adopting a 2035 goal of 3.5 percent for member countries\u2019 core defense spending. It could be embarrassing for the President to find himself below that amount back home.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap. Ours happens to come in the form of a M-F newsletter that keeps you up to speed on national security. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscribe\" target=\"_self\">Sign up today</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Another question raised at Wednesday\u2019s Armed Services hearing was exactly how the reconciliation bill defense money would be spent. At issue was the tradition known as \u201ccongressional intent,\u201d for Congress to designate spending amounts for specific defense items in legislation.</p><p>At the June 18 Armed Services hearing, Wicker asked, \u201cWe will put funds in the reconciliation bill, working with the House and working with the Administration, to get the [President\u2019s] signature on the bill. And we will make clear alongside that the specific congressional intent [on defense items]\u2026Mr. Secretary [Hegseth] do you commit to following congressional intent unequivocally on reconciliation.\u201d</p><p>After Hegseth gave a qualifying answer, Wicker demanded, \u201cDo you commit to following congressional intent unequivocally in reconciliation?\u201d This time, Hegseth answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I mention this because last Wednesday, Chairman Wicker released what he called an \u201cupdated legislative text of the defense reconciliation bill.\u201d It showed his committee had cut down to $1 billion the $3.3 billion it had previously allocated to deployment of military personnel in support of border operations.</p><p>However, the next day, Thursday, at a Pentagon press conference called to discuss the FY 2026 defense budget, details of which had just been made available, a Senior Defense Official made clear the figure DoD had for the reconciliation bill was different. He said, \u201cThe $5 billion we're requesting [from the reconciliation bill] is for border security for our troops to actually be there as well as for detention support.\u201d</p><p>The Defense Official added of the reconciliation funding, \u201cIt's the first time the Department of Defense has received mandatory money like this. It's ten-year money with a lot more flexibility than the average discretionary dollar provides.\u201d Remember, under traditional circumstances, congressional intent language in statutes determines how defense money is to be spent.</p><p>Under the original reconciliation bill, DoD had 90 days after the legislation became law to send the House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees their plans for spending the $150 billion. What was to happen thereafter is not spelled out, but it\u2019s clear the \u201cflexibility\u201d that the Defense Official has seen is not recognized by Sen. Wicker and, I expect, others on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Will today\u2019s complex circumstances be repeated?</p><p>I saw a hint in something the Senior Defense Official said to reporters last Thursday. Asked about the top defense budget figure for FY 2027, he said, \u201cWe have not yet discussed what that will look like for [FY] '27. But unless the president's tone changes, I imagine we'll stick with $1 trillion for national defense spending.\u201d</p><p>After the June 18, Armed Services hearing, Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said, \u201cAs I understand it, OMB is saying we are going to have a flat defense budget for the next four or five years. Are we playing reconciliation every year from now on?\u201d</p><p>The answer is maybe.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

Exact figures remain difficult to verify, as independent assessments vary. But CCTV claims that the missile\u2019s range is <a href=\"https://interestingengineering.com/military/china-nuclear-missile-can-hit-anywhere-in-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">approximately</a> 12,000 kilometers (7,460 miles), putting most of the continental United States and Europe within reach. So, why does this matter?</p><p>While the details of the DF-5B match some already disclosed details, the notion that state television is putting such a public focus on this is \u201cunusual and perhaps speaks to a willingness on China\u2019s part to begin signaling its nuclear growth in a more public manner,\u201d according to Matt Korda, Associate Director at the Federation of American Scientists\u2019 Nuclear Information Project.</p><p>\u201cChina has not traditionally commented on the details of its weapon systems and instead almost always sticks to high-level talking points. Perhaps this portends a shift in the country\u2019s communications strategy,\u201d Korda, who also serves as Associate Senior Researcher for the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction Program, tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>.</p><p>While the original DF-5 missile, <a href=\"https://as.com/actualidad/politica/china-da-detalles-del-monstruo-nuclear-heredero-de-la-guerra-fria-con-un-potencial-de-200-veces-hiroshima-n/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">developed</a> during the Cold War, was outfitted with a single warhead, the DF-5B\u2019s multi-warhead capacity\u2014alongside its purported accuracy within 500 meters\u2014 represents a significant leap in China\u2019s second-strike capability and nuclear survivability.</p><p>Andrew Erickson, a professor of strategy at the Naval War College and visiting China-focused scholar at Harvard University, believes that the renewed focus on this issue \u201cis part of a comprehensive effort to attempt to coerce and intimidate its adversaries regarding the military scenarios about which Beijing prioritizes most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeijing\u2019s goal is to show that it can match or exceed its adversaries on each rung of the escalation ladder; and also has the capability to utilize rungs, or combination of rungs, that its adversaries either do not possess or are more hesitant to use,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Andrew Scobell, Distinguished Fellow for China at the United States Institute of Peace, said, \u201cChina\u2019s communist rulers are feeling more insecure than usual, and this disclosure is their way of signaling \u2018don\u2019t mess with Beijing\u2019 to Washington and other capitals.\u201d</p><p> \u201cThe message is: China\u2019s nuclear weaponry and delivery systems are more capable today than ever before with a longer reach and greater accuracy,\u201d he tells <em>The Cipher Brief</em>.</p><p><strong>A Rapidly Expanding Arsenal</strong></p><p>China\u2019s nuclear arsenal <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2025/06/chinas-nuclear-arsenal-surges-20-in-one-year-reaching-over-600-warheads-sipri/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">remains</a> smaller than those of Russia or the United States, but it is growing at an unprecedented rate. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reports that China has increased its warhead count by about 100 in the past year, rising from 500 in 2024, to <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2025/06/chinas-nuclear-arsenal-surges-20-in-one-year-reaching-over-600-warheads-sipri/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">over 600</a> by January 2025.</p><p>The SIPRI report notes that China is \u201cexpanding its nuclear arsenal <a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/nuclear-risks-grow-new-arms-race-looms-new-sipri-yearbook-out-now\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">faster than</a> any other nuclear-armed state.\u201d Experts estimate that by 2035, if current trends continue, China could possess as many as 1,500 nuclear warheads\u2014a threefold increase that would still place it behind the United States and Russia, which together hold nearly 90 percent of the global stockpile.</p><p>But Multiple Independently target-able Reentry Vehicles (MIRVs) \u2014allow a single missile to carry several nuclear warheads, each aimed at a different target. This dramatically complicates interception, as the warheads can overwhelm defenses by arriving on separate trajectories, making coordinated response far more difficult and costly.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

Depending on deployment strategies, this could enable China to deploy several ICBMs comparable to those of Russia or the United States by the decade\u2019s end.</p><p><strong>Implications for Deterrence and Stability</strong></p><p>China\u2019s shift comes as the framework for nuclear arms control faces significant strain. With New START, the last remaining treaty limiting Russian and U.S. strategic nuclear arsenals, set to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-warns-outlook-extending-last-nuclear-arms-pact-with-us-does-not-look-2025-02-10/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">expire</a> in early 2026, and no successor agreement in place, the global arms control architecture appears increasingly obsolete.</p><p>Some experts warn that the world is effectively entering an era of unchecked nuclear competition and worry that the <a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/nuclear-risks-grow-new-arms-race-looms-new-sipri-yearbook-out-now#:~:text=China's%20nuclear%20arsenal%20is%20growing,mountainous%20areas%20in%20the%20east\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">growing</a> deployment of artificial intelligence, space-based sensors, and cyber capabilities could erode crisis stability and introduce new pathways to escalation.</p><p>Advanced systems can compress decision-making time and increase the risk of miscalculation or technical error, particularly in multi-theater conflict scenarios involving China and Russia. According to SIPRI, \u201cthe signs are that a new arms race is <a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/nuclear-risks-grow-new-arms-race-looms-new-sipri-yearbook-out-now\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">gearing up</a> that carries much more risk and uncertainty than the last one.\u201d</p><p><strong>Strategic Consequences for the West</strong></p><p>The implications of China\u2019s buildup extend far beyond Asia. Despite Russia and the United States\u2019 decades-long atomic dominance, China\u2019s rapidly expanding nuclear missile arsenal indicates a profound shift in global strategic dynamics.</p><p>For the West, experts emphasize that China\u2019s nuclear buildup is raising the stakes of deterrence and complicates arms control efforts. It also demands an urgent reassessment of defense postures\u2014particularly as Beijing builds a more flexible, survivable, and modernized nuclear triad \u2013 the ability to launch nuclear weapons from land-based missiles, submarine-launched missiles, and strategic bombers. This capability enables Beijing to more credibly challenge Western military presumptions.</p><p>\u201cAdvanced nuclear weapons and delivery systems are the ultimate backstop supporting Beijing\u2019s efforts to impose a Sisyphean sense of futility on its enemies while supporting the ultimate warfighting options should that preferred approach ultimately fail to deliver,\u201d Erickson said.</p><p>Analysts with the Federation of American Scientists have <a href=\"https://fas.org/publication-term/arms-control/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">observed</a> that China\u2019s expanded ICBM infrastructure enables more flexible deployment, blending fixed silos with mobile launchers and dual-use capabilities, which complicate both detection and preemption. And as the U.S. continues to serve as the primary security guarantor for Europe and the Indo-Pacific, it faces the potential challenge of confronting multiple nuclear-capable adversaries simultaneously. For example, if drawn into parallel conflicts\u2014such as a war in Ukraine and a Taiwan Strait crisis\u2014experts worry that its conventional forces could become overstretched, increasing a reliance on nuclear deterrence.</p><p><strong>The Next Phase of the Nuclear Race</strong></p><p>DF-5B represents more than just a technical advancement for Beijing; it is a calculated message to the world. China\u2019s modernization efforts are now a tangible reflection of the leadership\u2019s ambition to move closer to nuclear parity\u2014particularly in capability and survivability\u2014with the United States and Russia.</p><p>With arms control faltering and nuclear parity drawing near, the world is poised for a new era of strategic competition, marked by high stakes, blurred red lines, and faster-moving threats.

Deterring China is already a complex endeavor that is made even more challenging in today\u2019s tense U.S.-China environment.</p><p>Korda believe that engaging China in arms control talks will be challenging, as Beijing would \u201chave to accept some degree of transparency to join a verifiable arms control regime, and it has traditionally preferred to rely on opacity to safeguard its smaller nuclear arsenal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn addition, China is likely concerned that the United States\u2013\u2013particularly through its ever-expanding missile defense architecture, is seeking to erode its state of mutual vulnerability with its nuclear adversaries,\u201d he said.</p><p>According to Korda, China likely perceives time to be on its side as it continues to expand its nuclear arsenal and \u201cwill likely wait to engage in significant talks until it gains the leverage it thinks it needs to become a more equal negotiating partner.\u201d</p><p>Erickson contends that Beijing\u2019s strategic ambiguity remains central to its doctrine: a tactic and a message.</p><p>\u201cChina doesn\u2019t want us to understand their deterrence strategy; that lack of clarity is baked into the ambiguity,\u201d he notes. \u201cFor twenty years of dialogue on these issues, the Chinese government and Chinese experts outside of government did not engage meaningfully. I don\u2019t believe the PLA wants us to understand them.\u201d Still, others see it differently.</p><p>\u201cConventional wisdom in Washington holds that nuclear arms control is dead, but I do not agree.

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION --</strong> The core lessons from the Cold War should guide us as we face the new \u201cAxis of Aggressors\u201d today. First among these, is that we need to win the technology race.</p><p>Advanced technology made in United States did more than just put an American on the moon, it also solidified our economic foundation, empowered long-term entrepreneurial American leadership, and protected our national interests. </p><p>Maintaining this technology leadership should continue to be our priority today. Despite the Biden and Trump Administrations trying to limit the sale of U.S. software used to design semiconductors to Chinese groups, the U.S. government simply has not taken enough meaningful action to actually protect America\u2019s leadership position.</p><p>China is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-publish-policy-boost-risc-v-chip-use-nationwide-sources-2025-03-04/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">embracing</a> loopholes and openly flaunting strategic workarounds in our export policy that allows for the continued development of high-quality semiconductor chips with U.S. technology in China, despite our efforts to restrict Chinese access to such tools.</p><p>Along these same lines, Beijing plans to expand the use of open-source chip technology such as RISC V, in order to ween off its reliance on the West and spur the development of advanced chips in China. By leveraging RISC-V, Chinese companies are using open source software derived in the West to design their own processors for AI, cloud computing, and even military applications without violating current U.S. export restrictions.</p><p>And this shift is happening now.</p><p>Chinese tech giants like Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei have invested heavily in RISC-V research and development, looking to exploit this back-door access to western open source technology. Additionally, Chinese government-backed initiatives are pouring billions into this effort, positioning it as a national priority.</p><p>This should not have been a surprise: after all, <a href=\"https://jamestown.org/program/examining-chinas-grand-strategy-for-risc-v/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">experts</a> have been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/opinion-restoring-america/3289231/how-china-tech-threatens-us-cybersecurity/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">warning</a> for years that this day would come, and China<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-publish-policy-boost-risc-v-chip-use-nationwide-sources-2025-03-04/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> reportedly</a> plans to issue policy guidance to boost the use of RISC-V chips.</p><p>This has not gone completely unnoticed, though. <a href=\"https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/press-releases/gallagher-rubio-select-committee-members-urge-sec-raimondo-safeguard-american\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Congress</a> has been looking at this technology and China\u2019s ability to exploit it, and has rightfully raised a red flag, while the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security has been ramping up <a href=\"https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2024/12/us-strengthens-export-controls-on-advanced-computing-items#:~:text=BIS%20amended%20the%20Export%20Administration,Control%20Classification%20Numbers%20(ECCNs).\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">export controls</a> on advanced chip products.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

The stories highlighted how towing companies can begin the process to sell people\u2019s cars after 15 days, one of the shortest windows in the country.</p>\n\n<p>Reporters heard from dozens of drivers across Connecticut who had to pay exorbitant fees or had their vehicles sold when they couldn\u2019t afford the charges. Many told reporters about the severe consequences they experienced after their cars were towed or sold, including the loss of jobs, personal mementos and housing.</p>\n\n<p>While some people\u2019s cars might not have been towed under the new law, which takes effect Oct. 1, it doesn\u2019t solve all the problems that vehicle owners raised.  </p>\n\n<p>Here are some of their stories, as well as whether the changes in the new law would have helped them.</p>\n\nTowing Home Health Aides\n<p><em>Not fixed: The bill does not address this issue.</em></p>\n\n<p>Home care worker Maria Jim\u00e9nez circled the Hartford apartment complex for low-income seniors, looking for a place to park. Jim\u00e9nez drives patients to and from errands like doctor\u2019s appointments and grocery shopping. Her patient that day last November used a cane, and Jim\u00e9nez planned to park close so that her patient wouldn\u2019t have to walk too far.</p>\n\n<p>Unsuccessful, Jim\u00e9nez stopped in front of the building\u2019s entrance. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI turned on the hazard lights and left the car on, just long enough to let her know I had arrived, since I didn\u2019t have her phone number,\u201d she said. Jim\u00e9nez said she told a few bystanders she would be right back and asked them to keep an eye on her car. </p>\n\n<p>She said she went inside only briefly, and when she returned, the car was gone. Bystanders told Jim\u00e9nez the car had been towed and that they\u2019d pleaded with the truck\u2019s driver, to no avail.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Tracy Wodatch, president and CEO at Connecticut Association for Healthcare at Home, said many of her members complain about getting ticketed or towed when they\u2019re doing their jobs helping people.</p>\n\n<p>When it happens frequently enough at a particular complex, she said, an agency might speak with the landlord to ask for a designated spot. But there isn\u2019t a statewide mandate.  </p>\n\n<p>New Jersey passed a law in 2018 allowing home health care workers, visiting nurses and others to apply for a placard similar to an accessible parking tag to place in their cars.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMaybe we can talk to the legislators off session to see if there\u2019s anything we can do,\u201d Wodatch said.</p>\n\n<p>The company that towed Jim\u00e9nez, MyHoopty.com, was in Watertown, and Jim\u00e9nez was stranded over 30 miles away in Hartford. \u201cHow will I get there if I don\u2019t have a car?\u201d she recalled thinking.</p>\n\n<p>MyHoopty owner Michael Festa said the vehicle was parked in the fire lane without its hazard lights on for 17 minutes before it was towed and that the apartment complex had hired MyHoopty to prevent such parking violations.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is a critical safety issue, particularly at an elderly housing complex where the emergency access can be a matter of life and death,\u201d Festa said. (MyHoopty has <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/connecticut-dmv-tow-companies-car-sales\">appeared</a> in <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/connecticut-towing-dmv-lost-belongings\">other stories</a> in our series.)</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    Get in Touch\n<p>If you have information about health workers and caregivers being towed while on the job, email Dave Altimari at <a href=\"mailto:daltimari@ctmirror.org\">daltimari@ctmirror.org</a> or Ginny Monk at <a href=\"mailto:gmonk@ctmirror.org\">gmonk@ctmirror.org</a>, or call 203-626-4705.</p>\n\n\n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The apartment complex owners didn\u2019t respond to calls and emails for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Jim\u00e9nez said she makes about $290 a week. By the time she got to MyHoopty, the company told her the bill was more than $400.</p>\n\n<p>Her husband footed the bill. But it wasn\u2019t easy: \u201cThe only reason I could afford it is because I work mornings, I work nights,\u201d he said.</p>\n\nShort Meters and Unpaid Tickets\n<p><em>Not fixed: The bill does not address this issue.</em>  </p>\n\n<p>Marie Franklin paid the parking meter and dashed into Hartford housing court for a December 2023 hearing that would determine if she would get evicted from her apartment. She worried about the parking. People can wait for hours for the judge to call their cases, but the Hartford Parking Authority limits nearby meters to two hours.</p>\n\n<p>So people facing eviction sometimes run the risk of getting a parking violation, getting their cars towed or missing their names being called for hearings, which can cause them to lose their housing in a default judgement for not showing up to court.</p>\n\n<p>Joshua Michtom, a Hartford City Council member and an attorney who has represented children and parents in juvenile court, said although there\u2019s a nearby parking garage, it\u2019s more expensive and it fills up.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou have to be there, but then you don\u2019t know how long you\u2019re going to have to wait,\u201d Michtom said. \u201cAnd the courts are not particularly forgiving if you\u2019re not there the moment your case gets called.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When Franklin\u2019s name was finally called, a judge rejected her plea to stave off eviction. Dejected and stressed about losing her home, she walked out of court only to discover her 2015 Volvo was gone. Franklin had more than a dozen unpaid parking tickets, some of which were nearly 20 years old. She\u2019d forgotten about some, and others were for vehicles she no longer owned. About half of the tickets were for exceeding the meter limit or parking over the line near the courthouse.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI had paid for the parking meter and everything,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cThey drive around, and they look for people\u2019s cars.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Marie Franklin\u2019s car was towed during her eviction hearing.\n    \n            (Shahrzad Rasekh/CT Mirror)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Jill Turlo, CEO of the Hartford Parking Authority, said the agency\u2019s officers use license plate scanners to find people with outstanding tickets. Turlo said \u201chigh-traffic metered areas,\u201d like the street the courthouse is on, are \u201cregularly patrolled by parking enforcement.\u201d Turlo said that the parking authority has not received any requests to extend the time for metered parking near the courthouses.</p>\n\n<p>While towing cars for unpaid parking tickets is a common practice for cities, Minnesota passed a law last year barring such tows, seeing them as an unfair burden on low-income families. Several cities, including Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, have also stopped such tows after a California appeals court ruled that towing cars for unpaid parking tickets violated people\u2019s rights against warrantless seizures, said Rebecca Miller, an attorney with the Western Center on Law &amp; Poverty.</p>\n\n<p>Hartford has one of the strictest policies in Connecticut. A city ordinance allows tows after two or more unpaid tickets that date back to September 2012. Other cities including Danbury and New Britain don\u2019t tow for unpaid tickets. Norwalk and Waterbury will tow if there are four unpaid tickets; Stamford tows for three unpaid tickets or more than $250 owed, officials in those cities said. The limit in Bridgeport is $100, and New Haven\u2019s is $200.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe do have an ordinance where we can boot a car for unpaid tickets, but we haven\u2019t used it in years,\u201d said Deborah Pacific, director of the Danbury Parking Authority.</p>\n\n<p>When Franklin went to eviction court, she had been trying to hold onto the place she and her daughter lived while she looked for a new job. Between unpaid fines, late fees, and towing and storage charges, it would have cost almost $3,000 to get her car back, she said.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    Get in Touch\n<p>If you have information about towing near courthouses, email Dave Altimari at <a href=\"mailto:daltimari@ctmirror.org\">daltimari@ctmirror.org</a> or Ginny Monk at <a href=\"mailto:gmonk@ctmirror.org\">gmonk@ctmirror.org</a>, or call 203-626-4705.</p>\n\n\n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>\u201cI would have chose to pay whatever I owed to my housing. So my car, there was nothing I could do,\u201d Franklin said.</p>\n\n<p>The vehicle was towed by Metro Auto Body &amp; Towing, which did not return calls and emails for comment. It was later sold by the lender.</p>\n\n<p>After losing her car and housing, Franklin moved to Florida to stay with her son.</p>\n\nParking Sticker in the Wrong Place\n<p><em>Fixed: Apartment residents now have 72 hours if caught without a parking permit or with an expired one.</em></p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s often little discrepancies that lead to big consequences. When Tishawn Tillman moved into his Hartford apartment in September, he got a parking sticker that allowed him to park in the building\u2019s private lot. He said he wasn\u2019t sure where to put it, so he stuck it on the driver\u2019s side window. </p>\n\n<p>But less than a month later, his car was towed by Cross Country Automotive in Hartford.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere is absolutely no legal documentation in my lease that says that this has to be strictly on the windshield,\u201d Tillman said.</p>\n\n<p>Minor rule violations such as parking crooked or not backing into a space have caused people\u2019s cars to be towed and then sold when they couldn\u2019t afford the fees. Stories like Tillman\u2019s drove legislators to act. Under the new law, the towing company would have had to warn Tillman, giving him 72 hours to get a new sticker and place it in the right spot. The law also says towers have to get permission from the apartment complex to tow a vehicle unless it\u2019s blocking traffic or parked in a fire lane.</p>\n\n<p>Tillman said he assumed his car had been stolen. But the police told him it had been towed.</p>\n\n<p>Tillman contacted Cross Country: \u201cI asked them, \u2018Did you see my sticker?\u2019 And they said, \u2018We didn\u2019t see the sticker.\u2019\u201d He said he called the apartment manager, but he wouldn\u2019t help.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I realized that neither of the parties were going to budge on the matter, I told them that I wasn\u2019t going to pay the fine, even if I had the money, which I didn\u2019t at the time,\u201d Tillman said.</p>\n\n<p>Tillman said his bill was \u201c$200 but growing every day.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He filed a complaint with the attorney general\u2019s office, which said it unsuccessfully tried to resolve the issue through its voluntary mediation program and recommended he complain to the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Sal Sena, Cross Country\u2019s owner, submitted a letter to the attorney general saying there are signs all over the parking lot explaining the rules. The apartment manager, Jack Matos, wrote to the attorney general that he talked with Sena about giving TIllman a discount on the towing fees.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI reiterated Tishawn needs to make sure that it\u2019s placed on the windshield,\u201d Matos wrote.</p>\n\n<p>Frustrated, Tillman eventually gave up trying to get his car back.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI went from being a self-made young man with his own apartment and car to having to burn a hole in my pocket just to get to and from work on ride-share services like Uber and Lyft,\u201d he said.</p>\n\nUnable to Reclaim Car Despite Having the Title\n<p><em>Fixed: The law allows vehicle owners to reclaim their cars with other documents besides DMV registration.</em></p>\n\n<p>Shaleah Carr needed two more weeks until her DMV appointment in April to register the Chevrolet Malibu she had just bought from her mom. It was the earliest appointment she could get.</p>\n\n<p>Her boyfriend had taken the car to his brother\u2019s house to work on it when they decided to take it for a test drive. But the car broke down on U.S. Route 5 in South Windsor, and police called for a tow. </p>\n\n<p>Her boyfriend told the tow truck driver that the car was registered to Carr\u2019s mother and that Carr had the title and proof of insurance. But the towing company, Tolland Automotive, wouldn\u2019t release the vehicle to Carr because she wasn\u2019t the registered owner, said the company\u2019s owner, George Fellows. The vehicle was towed on a Friday afternoon, and by the time Carr was able to get to the lot on Monday morning, she owed more than $300.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI told them I\u2019m on one income and I can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Carr said. \u201cI just paid my rent for that month, and I even asked, \u2018Do you guys do payments?\u2019\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Since then, her Malibu has been sitting in the company\u2019s lot.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Shaleah Carr couldn\u2019t reclaim her car even though she has the title.\n    \n            (Shahrzad Rasekh/CT Mirror)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Carr\u2019s dilemma has happened to people whose cars have been towed across Connecticut \u2014 they\u2019ve been unable to quickly register their cars and then blocked from reclaiming them because they\u2019re not registered in their names yet. By the time they can register their cars, so much time has passed that the tow bill is too expensive or the company has sold their car.</p>\n\n<p>The new law gives consumers time to register their car before it can be towed and requires towers to release vehicles if presented with the title or a bill of sale as proof of ownership. The law also requires towers to accept other forms of payment besides cash and demands towers have business hours on weekends so fees don\u2019t accrue while they\u2019re closed.</p>\n\n<p>Fellows said police called them to the scene. \u201cThen we found out that this guy didn\u2019t own the car at all,\u201d Fellows said. Without the owner there, \u201cit had to come back to our shop.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Carr called her mother. \u201cI was like, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to come up here,\u2019 but even if she does, she can\u2019t really do much,\u201d Carr said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have the money to get it back either.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Carr said the last time she called Tolland Automotive, the bill was $800. Given that she paid her mother only $500 for the car, she said, it almost wasn\u2019t worth trying to get it back anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Fellows said Carr\u2019s mother did come into the office earlier this month with proof of registration, and he is willing to release the vehicle if she pays what is owed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all on them,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean they knew what the issue was back then.

He propped up his cellphone next to his laptop and hit record on a video app.</p>\n\n<p>There were several people in the meeting with Sharon, who at the time was a pediatrician with the University of Minnesota. Two hospital leaders, Sharon\u2019s boss and a lawyer were there, too. But the person Sharon was most wary of was in the lower-right corner of the grid of faces: Dr. Nancy Harper, the director of the child abuse team at University of Minnesota Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital in Minneapolis.</p>\n\n<p>Sharon suspected that the discussion, about the care of a 3-month-old named Hank, was going to be contentious. He worried that someday, perhaps even in court, he might need evidence of his role caring for Hank. He was prepared to argue with Harper if she challenged his clinical judgment, but it was quickly apparent that the quality of the care he provided was not at issue.</p>\n\n<p>Hank was born small and was not eating well or gaining enough weight; sometimes, according to his parents, he just seemed to be in pain. (ProPublica is using a nickname for the child at the parents\u2019 request.) At an appointment in January, a doctor ordered an endoscopy, a procedure where a tiny camera is threaded through the body, and also suggested an MRI.</p>\n\n<p>The scans of Hank\u2019s brain showed fluid pooled under both sides of his skull. The blood was old, possibly months old, and Hank was admitted to the hospital. Sharon met him the next day.</p>\n\n<p>A member of Harper\u2019s team named Dr. Caroline George also evaluated Hank that day. In her opinion, according to court records, the bleeding was \u201cconsistent with abusive head trauma.\u201d Sharon had suggested other possible causes, including an injury from birth, an infection or even spontaneous bleeding. Sharon wrote in the child\u2019s medical record that it\u2019s \u201clikely we will never identify the exact mechanism that caused his injury.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Three days after Hank was admitted, Sharon said he learned that a county child protection services worker was preparing to come to the hospital to take custody of the baby, as well as his 2-year-old brother, William.</p>\n\n<p>Sharon said that he was stunned that no one had spoken to him since he was Hank\u2019s primary doctor. So he did something that seemed to put him at odds with George, Harper and hospital leadership: He told Hank\u2019s parents, CPS and police he didn\u2019t think the bleeding alone was enough evidence to say this was abuse.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Sharon was also concerned that separating a sick infant from his parents based only on a suspicion of abuse would cause more harm to Hank. Working with the detective assigned to the case, he admitted William, though the older boy was not sick, so that the whole family could stay in the hospital under the supervision of a nursing assistant while doctors continued to treat and monitor Hank.</p>\n\n<p>But four days later, according to Sharon, his supervisor told him that he was being removed from Hank\u2019s care team, and that he should not communicate further with the parents. When Sharon asked why, he said he was told it was at Harper\u2019s recommendation. \u201cThe care,\u201d he said, \u201cchanged the second she got involved.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In less than 48 hours, a judge determined that Hank and William were in need of child protection services and their parents were forced to leave the hospital without them. The same day, Sharon said, he was summoned to the first of two meetings with hospital leadership and Harper. When his supervisors scheduled the second meeting \u2014 titled \u201cReview of CPS Patient\u201d in the emailed invitation \u2014 less than a month later, Sharon came prepared to record it.</p>\n\n<p>Before all this, Sharon had an appreciation for Harper\u2019s formidability and for her influence in the world of child abuse pediatrics. She began her career as a pediatrician in the U.S. Navy before leading a child abuse team at a hospital in Texas. In 2014, she became the director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Safe and Healthy Children.</p>\n\n<p>A certified child abuse pediatrician for almost 16 years, the 56-year-old Harper consulted on suspected cases of abuse for several Twin Cities hospital systems, testified as an expert witness in child abuse trials across the U.S. and lectured on diagnosing signs of abuse. She was also the vice president of the Ray E. Helfer Society, a national nonprofit organization for physicians who work on the medical aspects of child abuse and neglect, and she became its president in 2023.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Harper testifies for the prosecution at a 2021 trial.\n    \n            (Coburn Dukehart/Wisconsin Watch)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Sharon, now 53 years old, was also well-respected. Originally from Israel, he came to the U.S. in 2003 to continue his medical studies. He began as a fellow at the University of Minnesota in 2006 and had been on faculty for 12 years. Specializing in infectious diseases, he became medical director of the university\u2019s pediatric COVID-19 clinic and was a contributing member of the state Health Department\u2019s Long COVID Guiding Council. Sharon was also a hospitalist, meaning he directed the care for admitted patients like Hank, coordinating with other doctors and specialists.</p>\n\n<p>As the online February meeting progressed, it became clear to Sharon that, in a face-off with Harper, his medical expertise and the fact that he considered many of the people on the call to be friends counted for little. The lawyer noted that differing medical opinions could open the hospital or the doctors themselves up to a lawsuit. George added that the differences in opinions had also \u201cmade things difficult for particularly law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child abuse expert,\u201d said Dr. Sameer Gupta, the chief medical officer of the hospital, on the call. \u201cBut, you know, my experience is this: Try to be completely aligned. That\u2019s one story that\u2019s coming from the medical team as much as possible, to avoid the potential for, one, litigation, two, to let the experts really drive the ship.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>Sharon became increasingly agitated during the call, shaking his head. He was angry that the conversation had revolved around protocols and the hospital\u2019s legal liabilities, rather than Hank\u2019s care.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think I did the best any doctor can do at that point in making sure that my patient is getting the best care while I\u2019m not trying to hide any potential abuse,\u201d he said during the meeting, the video of which he shared with ProPublica. \u201cI felt very uncomfortable that CPS are showing up unannounced and taking two children away from the parents without having a discussion with the doctors who take care of this patient. I hope no one expects me not to say something when that happens in front of me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But Harper seemed to suggest that Hank might have been seen by too many doctors, and that Sharon had interfered with her team\u2019s ability to \u201cframe\u201d the case to CPS and law enforcement. She said she did not consider it her role to be concerned about what could happen to a family after a diagnosis.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d she said, \u201cif I spent all of my time worrying about \u2026 what\u2019s going to happen with child protection and foster care or the cost for the legal stuff afterwards, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do my job.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sharon began to protest. He said he had been reading the scientific literature on abusive head trauma and found it unconvincing, a conclusion more and more doctors were coming to. Harper cut him off. \u201cIf I spent two weeks reading the literature on COVID, would you consider me as qualified as you are?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for decades.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Gupta abruptly shut down the conversation. He said that Sharon\u2019s plan to keep the family in the hospital was the \u201cwrong decision and will never, ever happen again,\u201d and then he ended the call.</p>\n\n<p>As the screen went blank, Sharon let out a long, deep sigh. Though disturbed and frustrated, he did not yet realize his actions on behalf of Hank and his family would affect his career. Over time, Sharon came to see Harper as the main driver of a campaign to get him to fall in line with the child abuse team.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s very black and white, right and wrong, no gray area,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is not the way to do medicine or pediatrics.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>Harper did not respond to requests for comment. She and a spokesperson for University of Minnesota Physicians, which is the clinical practice for the university\u2019s medical school faculty, also did not respond to a detailed list of questions. But the spokesperson wrote that the Otto Bremer Trust Center for Safe and Healthy Children, as it is now called and which is led by Harper, provides \u201ctrauma-informed medical care and psychosocial support while addressing research, prevention, advocacy, policy and education.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen healthcare providers and community organizations refer patients to CSCH, the team only makes decisions about diagnoses and subsequent medical care based on expert assessment of medical evidence (e.g., medical history, physical exam, lab and radiological findings, input from other medical specialists and information provided by caregivers),\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cFurther investigations and legal determinations are outside of our team\u2019s scope.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for Fairview Health Services, which owns Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital, said in a statement that although Harper is an employee of University of Minnesota Physicians, \u201cwe obviously take these concerns seriously and are actively reviewing the matter.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur highest priority is the safety, dignity, and wellbeing of our patients and families \u2014 especially in moments of crisis. We are aware of concerns being raised regarding the conduct of a University of Minnesota Physicians (UMP)-employed provider who practices in a UMP-led clinic within the M Health Fairview Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cWe are in close communication with our academic partners and are evaluating any steps we may need to take to preserve the trust our patients and families place in us.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<p>Harper\u2019s arrival in Minnesota coincided with the fallout of a high-profile tragedy: the 2013 death of 4-year-old Eric Dean.</p>\n\n<p>Dean lived with his family in sparsely populated Pope County, in west-central Minnesota. <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/eric-dean-the-boy-they-couldn-t-save/273325741\">According to an investigation by The Minnesota Star Tribune</a>, teachers and caregivers reported signs that Dean was being abused to child protection workers at least 15 times before his stepmother threw him across a room, causing injuries that would kill him. She is in prison serving a life sentence.</p>\n\n<p>In response, then-Gov. Mark Dayton signed an executive order in 2014 creating the Governor\u2019s Task Force on the Protection of Children. The next year, along with a slew of other reforms, the state Legislature created a $23.35 million grant to give counties money based partially on the number of open child protection investigations.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        <p>She\u2019s very black and white, right and wrong, no gray area, which is not the way to do medicine or pediatrics.</p>\n\n    \n        \n        \u2014Dr. Bazak Sharon\n\n    \n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The number of child abuse cases soared. For instance, in Hennepin County, where Minneapolis is located, cases of physical abuse more than doubled from 2015 to 2016, before dropping over the next several years. Child abuse experts attributed the rise to what Joanna Woolman, a law professor who specializes in child abuse law, called \u201ca moment of hyper-awareness around medical child abuse and child abuse in general.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe were convening a task force that was heavily made up of people with the view that we needed to do more, have more eyes on, be more aware,\u201d added Woolman, who is also the executive director of the nonprofit Keeping Families Connected Minnesota, which provides free legal services to families going through child protection proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>A subspecialty of pediatrics first recognized by the American Board of Pediatrics in 2006, child abuse pediatrics focuses on the diagnosis and documentation of signs of abuse. A diagnosis can help determine whether a parent loses custody of their child or faces criminal investigation. In cases where children die, it can mean murder charges. Harper was one of the first certified child abuse pediatricians in the country \u2014 the board counts over 350 subspeciality certifications nationwide \u2014 and is one of seven currently certified in Minnesota.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPhysicians with less training on child abuse and neglect both over- and under-identify injuries in children, whether they\u2019re physical abuse injuries, sexual abuse injuries,\u201d she testified in a 2019 trial. \u201cA child with a missed injury could come back later with a more serious injury or even die. And so these are sort of issues where we realize that we needed expertise.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Harper was hired as director of the Center for Safe and Healthy Children by the University of Minnesota the same year as Dayton\u2019s executive order. According to testimony she gave in a 2019 criminal trial, the university recruited her to build up the center and create a regionwide child abuse consultation system.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m on call, I can be covering up to six different places where children can be seen,\u201d Harper testified.</p>\n\n<p>In 2016, the Otto Bremer Trust, a private charitable organization based in St. Paul, announced a $2.5 million grant to fund Harper\u2019s ambitions to expand the center, which is based at Masonic. Harper is also program director for the university\u2019s Child Abuse Pediatrics Fellowship, a three-year training program, giving her influence over the next generation of child abuse pediatricians. A spokesperson for the trust added that it does not have any \u201crole in the day-to-day operations of the Center.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Hennepin County has a contract with Harper\u2019s employer, University of Minnesota Physicians, to provide medical consultation, expert witness testimony and case consultation with county attorneys. According to testimony Harper has given in the past, she and her team handle about 700 cases of suspected abuse each year. She has testified that 10% to 20% of those wind up confirmed for physical abuse, although it is difficult to determine if these figures are accurate since child protection case records are not public. She has given different answers on the witness stand when asked if she has ever testified for the defense; in 2021, she said she\u2019d testified for the defense in a \u201chalf dozen or a dozen\u201d cases. In 2023, she said she\u2019d done so twice.</p>\n\n<p>In 2018, Harper\u2019s center began cohosting an annual Child Abuse Summit with the Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office. In 2022, she received an introduction during a panel discussion from Dan Allard, senior assistant Hennepin County attorney, that illustrated the close relationship between Harper and her team and county prosecutors.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you haven\u2019t heard Dr. Harper testify, she does a wonderful job. She knows her stuff,\u201d Allard, who is also the head of the county attorney\u2019s child abuse team, said at the summit. \u201cWe just barely try to keep up understanding what she\u2019s talking about. So we just kind of let her go.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In response to a detailed list of questions, Daniel Borgertpoepping, a spokesperson for the Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office, wrote, \u201cSince our office represents Hennepin County in CPS matters, we are unable to comment.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Before Sharon\u2019s encounter with Harper, he hadn\u2019t given much thought to her team\u2019s practices, which included evaluating and treating some of the worst cases of physical and sexual abuse of children. While he said he had referred a dozen or so cases of suspected neglect to her team, he viewed their work as a bleak side of pediatrics. He was happy to avoid it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI had a lot of respect for the child abuse doctors, like, \u2018Thank you for doing that for us,\u2019\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>But for roughly 15 years, the world of child abuse pediatrics has been roiled by criticism of the diagnosis once known as shaken baby syndrome and now categorized <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/shaken-baby-syndrome-abusive-head-trauma-controversy\">under the umbrella term abusive head trauma</a>. A triad of symptoms \u2014 brain bleeding, brain swelling or injury, and blood in the retina \u2014 was once considered evidence that a child had been violently shaken, even if there were no other injuries or even bruising.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>In court testimony, Harper has said that both shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma are considered scientifically valid diagnoses by \u201cthe mainstream medical community,\u201d and that the controversy is more of a legal one than a medical one. She has acknowledged there are medical conditions that mimic possible signs of abuse, including bruises, bone fractures and head trauma symptoms, but she said that her assessments take all of that into account in concert with specialists like neurosurgeons and radiologists.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe take a very detailed history from the family. We do a physical examination, look at past medical history, other medical conditions, the initial laboratory and X-ray reports,\u201d she testified in 2023.</p>\n\n<p>Sharon readily concedes that he wasn\u2019t an expert in child abuse medicine. But as he and the other doctors tried to understand the bleeding in Hank\u2019s brain as well as his lack of weight gain, he spent his evenings reading the scientific and legal literature about shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma, scribbling notes to himself. He read a key American Academy of Pediatrics statement reaffirming its belief in the diagnoses; he also read studies that challenged the science underlying them.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is wrong to fail to advise parents and courts when these are simply hypotheses, not proven medical or scientific facts,\u201d Sharon wrote on a copy of one law review article.</p>\n\n<p>He read about how the first neurosurgeon to posit the theory of shaken baby syndrome said in an interview years later that he was \u201cdisturbed that what I intended as a friendly suggestion for avoiding injury to children has become an excuse for imprisoning innocent parents.\u201d According to the National Registry of Exonerations, over 40 people convicted in cases related to the diagnosis have been exonerated since the 1990s, often over increasing doubts that the three symptoms can be interpreted so definitively.</p>\n\n<p>Sharon also learned that the subspecialty of child abuse pediatrics itself has also been under increasing scrutiny. Perhaps the most famous child abuse pediatrician case became the basis for the Netflix documentary \u201cTake Care of Maya,\u201d in which <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy.html?_gl=1*xft5rk*FPAU*MTgzOTA2ODM1My4xNzQzNDI2Njc1*_ga*MTI5OTQxMTA1Ny4xNzQzNDI2Njc0*_ga_DNE38RK1HX*MTc0NDQ1ODQ4Mi4zLjAuMTc0NDQ1ODQ4My4wLjAuNjczNTkxNzcw*_fplc*ZXk2aXhVSjFtcGIlMkZzSzhJVXQ5blZpJTJGMnNld3VOVW01dDdpcEhhZURvV1pxRG13bENpJTJGaVZoclVMcG1UY2JtRGhzUTZKcVlkSlZIY0pYSWhxUHVsdHAzU0k1T01tVHdsblNHREhzJTJCY3loSEc1QkwxbGhiY1phZUZDRVY1c0ElM0QlM0Q.\">a 10-year-old girl\u2019s pain syndrome</a> was diagnosed by a child abuse pediatrician as Munchausen syndrome by proxy. A jury found the hospital liable for medical malpractice and awarded the family over $200 million; the hospital has appealed. Several families <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25978982-esernio-jenssen-complaint-2024/\">are suing a Pennsylvania hospital</a> for what they say are false diagnoses of abuse by Dr. Debra Esernio-Jenssen, who led its child abuse team. <a href=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/series/flawed-forensics/\">A series of allegations of overzealous diagnoses</a> of abuse have followed Dr. Barbara Knox from her job leading a child abuse team at the University of Wisconsin to similar positions in Alaska and at the University of Florida.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Sharon began to question the scientific nature of shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma after his dispute with Harper\u2019s team. \u201cIt is wrong to fail to advise parents and courts when these are simply hypotheses, not proven medical or scientific facts,\u201d he wrote on a copy of one law review article.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>The child abuse pediatrician community is tightknit. After Knox left Wisconsin, Harper replaced her as an expert witness in some criminal cases. Esernio-Jenssen wrote Harper a nomination letter for a Ray E. Helfer Society award, <a href=\"https://www.helfersociety.org/nancy-harper\">calling her \u201can unstoppable force.\u201d</a></p>\n\n<p>Esernio-Jenssen and Knox, as well as the Helfer Society, did not respond to requests for comment. In a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25978983-esernio-jenssen-complaint-response-2024/\">response to the lawsuit</a>, attorneys for Esernio-Jenssen and her former hospital network wrote that they \u201care being attacked and demonized for protecting children from abuse and following the law,\u201d and that the allegations of bad-faith abuse investigations are \u201cobviously untrue.\u201d The lawsuit is ongoing.</p>\n\n<p>Knox was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25978979-knox-alaska-complaint-2022/\">sued by two families in Alaska</a> who accused her of leveling false accusations of abuse against them. In response, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25979000-knox-affidavit-response-to-complaint-2022/\">Knox said in an affidavit</a> that she has no say over whether child protection takes children away from their parents, that she did not \u201cconspire\u201d with police or anyone else on custody issues or criminal prosecution, and that she did not personally evaluate one of the named children. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2024 after the families agreed to drop the matter.</p>\n\n<p>According to a spokesperson for the University of Florida, Knox resigned her job there as a pediatrician with the Child Protective Team, effective Aug. 15. He declined to comment on the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>From the start, Sharon thought what was happening to Hank \u2014 a child struggling with eating and weight gain, with abnormal results on his endoscopy and weeks-old, unexplained cranial bleeding without any other symptoms of abuse \u2014 fit into his wheelhouse treating complex and even mysterious cases more than it fit into Harper\u2019s. After poring through the literature on abusive head trauma, he was even more convinced.</p>\n\n<p>Sharon followed his supervisor\u2019s instruction not to speak to Hank\u2019s parents. But after the couple\u2019s attorney approached him, he provided a five-page account of Hank\u2019s medical treatment. He included several potential alternative diagnoses.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is clear to me that missing child abuse is as serious as missing bacterial meningitis and should be considered as malpractice,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut also, as a hospitalist, who frequently manage children without clear definitions of their diagnosis, I\u2019m used to ambiguity.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Matthias Zinn, Hank\u2019s neurologist, agreed with Sharon that the fluid in Hank\u2019s brain, what he called \u201csubdural collections,\u201d could not be definitively tied to abuse. He provided a letter to the couple\u2019s attorney as well. Zinn, who said he\u2019s consulted on hundreds of cases of suspected abuse, said Harper\u2019s child abuse team was by far the most aggressive he\u2019s worked with.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt was just crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember speaking to them and saying, \u2018What evidence do you have, other than the subdural collections?\u2019 And they made it clear that they did not respect my opinion.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Zinn has since left the University of Minnesota for a position in Florida.</p>\n\n<p>Both a CPS investigator and a police detective spoke to Sharon repeatedly, and according to Hank\u2019s parents, they also relayed Zinn\u2019s opinion and begged CPS to talk to him as well. But the CPS petition alleging Hank was a victim of abuse only cited George\u2019s assessment. There\u2019s no mention of Sharon or Zinn.</p>\n\n<p>George did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>A spokesperson for Hennepin County declined to comment on individual cases or to respond to a detailed list of questions. But she provided a statement from Kwesi Booker, the director of Hennepin County Children and Family Services, which oversees child protection services. In that statement, Booker said \u201cchild protection social workers appropriately rely on the subject matter expertise of trained medical professionals in situations involving complex medical issues.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Unable to let the matter go, Sharon wrote letters to the hospital\u2019s leadership council about what he called \u201cdangerous overreach\u201d by Harper\u2019s child abuse team. In response, Gupta said he referred the letter for review to the hospital\u2019s Committee for Professional Enhancement. Citing privacy laws, hospital administrators would not tell Sharon the outcome of the committee\u2019s review.</p>\n\n<p>Separately, Gupta wrote Sharon a \u201cpeer review\u201d letter informing him that, in several of his cases, there were concerns about his conduct, professionalism and a disregard for hospital protocol. Sharon said he was aware of his reputation for being strong-willed and, at times, dismissive or even rude to colleagues. The letter warned him against doing anything that could be seen as \u201cretaliatory\u201d toward other members of the staff. Gupta gave three examples related to Sharon\u2019s purportedly improper procedures for prescribing medications for pediatric COVID-19 patients; he also referred to Sharon\u2019s interaction with the child abuse team.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYour documentation in the chart and communication with law enforcement was contrary to what was being stated by the child abuse team,\u201d Gupta wrote in the peer review letter. \u201cThis created confusion with the community workers and with the family in a situation in which consistency is very important.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Gupta did not respond to repeated requests for comment or to a list of questions.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n\n<p>Hank\u2019s family had a limited view of what was going on behind the scenes at Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital, even though Hank\u2019s mother, Kay, worked in the neonatal intensive care unit there. She recognized Sharon and knew of George, though she hadn\u2019t worked closely with either. Because Hank\u2019s parents both work in the pediatric field and for the privacy of their children, they asked that ProPublica not use their full names.</p>\n\n<p>The day after Hank\u2019s admission, Kay and her husband, Ross, explained to George about the baby\u2019s difficulty with breastfeeding, his inexplicable pain and his inability to tolerate formula. When George asked her about possible accidents or injuries, the only thing Kay could think of was a time when she was driving and slammed on the brakes with Hank in his car seat.</p>\n\n<p>After she read the CPS petition alleging her children were victims of physical abuse, Kay said that she came to suspect that George had been trying to collect information to use against her and her husband, not to treat Hank.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think she was sitting there hoping that I was just going to confess or tell her that I thought my husband might have done it,\u201d Kay said. \u201cAnd I was just hoping that she was going to help me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>While Hank and William were in foster care, police confiscated the couple\u2019s cellphones, laptops and baby monitors, and interviewed various family members and friends. In April 2022, Hennepin County decided not to pursue criminal charges.</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>CPS found no additional evidence of abuse, and after nearly four months, a judge ordered both boys returned to the couple, though it was on the condition that a grandparent live in the home full time as well. In June, just before a trial to determine if Hank had been abused, CPS agreed to begin the process of dismissing the matter, though the agency still made a \u201cfinding of maltreatment\u201d by an \u201cunknown offender.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In late July, the Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office signed off on the dismissal. It had been nearly seven months since Hank was first admitted to the hospital.</p>\n\n<p>Around the same time, Kay and Ross took Hank for genetic testing, which showed he carried an abnormal gene duplication with unknown effects. He was also put on medication that resolved his stomach sensitivity issues and increased his appetite. One of Sharon\u2019s theories was that the bleeding under his skull was due to poor feeding, dehydration or vitamin deficiency, though no one has been able to identify a definitive cause.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s just been our little mystery baby, but he is a beautiful, healthy, thriving little 3-year-old,\u201d Kay said.</p>\n\n<p>William, she said, still has nightmares about being taken from his parents. At 5 years old, he insists on sleeping in their bed every night. Defending themselves, Kay said, plus the cost of additional caregivers amounted to roughly $100,000 for the family.</p>\n\n<p>Kay never met Harper and only later came to understand the role she played. Because there was no trial, she never had the chance to confront Harper or George, or lay out any of the arguments that she and her husband had been falsely accused of abuse.</p>\n\n<p>But just before the case closed, Kay saw an advertisement for the 2022 Child Abuse Summit, with Harper as a featured panelist. She bought a ticket to the event and sat right in front of Harper.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey do these things and probably never have to see the people again, outside of places where they\u2019re in charge,\u201d she remembered thinking. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to see me.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<p>Sharon did not know it at the time, but he was far from the only person struggling in recent years to keep a family from losing their children after Harper\u2019s involvement. In his job as an attorney for indigent parents at Hennepin County Adult Representation Services, Scotty Ducharme has dealt with horror stories and seen cases of extreme child abuse up close. But when allegations have arisen almost exclusively from a medical diagnosis from a child abuse pediatrician, which he calls a \u201cCAP,\u201d he has also seen signs that not all the doctors on the child\u2019s treatment team are in lockstep.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you read the medical records written by the CAPs versus the regular doctors in the cases I\u2019ve worked on, you can see the breadcrumbs by the regular doctors who don\u2019t believe what the CAPs are saying,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve only caught, on the record, doctors directly contradicting each other a few times.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            \u201cI\u2019ve only caught, on the record, doctors directly contradicting each other a few times,\u201d said Scotty Ducharme, a former attorney for indigent parents at Hennepin County Adult Representation Services who is now in private practice.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In the spring of 2023, Ducharme met Mar\u00eda Alejandra Ram\u00edrez Rodr\u00edguez and her husband, Cristian Andr\u00e9s Guzm\u00e1n de la Ossa, a couple in their 20s. Recent arrivals from Colombia who spoke no English, they brought their 4-week-old son to Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis after noticing bruises on his thighs, back, forehead and face. They had taken photos of previous bruises as well, which they shared with doctors. (ProPublica is not naming the child to protect his privacy.) The couple also brought him to the hospital when he was 12 days old because his umbilical stump wouldn\u2019t stop bleeding.</p>\n\n<p>Harper examined the baby and reviewed X-rays of his skeleton. The results were alarming; he had 14 healing rib fractures, as well as fractures in his arms and legs in various states of healing. Harper wrote that the baby was \u201cat grave risk for further injury, morbidity and mortality,\u201d and the Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office filed an expedited petition to permanently sever the parents\u2019 rights. The baby was placed in foster care with a woman who worked as a nurse.</p>\n\n<p>When Ducharme looked at the medical records, he saw that the baby had gone through a number of blood tests, including ones to check for clotting disorders. Several metrics were marked slightly outside of the normal range, including a reading for a protein tied to a genetic clotting disorder called von Willebrand disease. Ducharme zeroed in on a particular note, perhaps a \u201cbreadcrumb,\u201d written by the pediatrician who saw the baby before Harper; he wrote that the baby would need more follow up from the hematology department \u201cif more bruising develops.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>While in the care of the foster parent, the baby developed new bruises and Harper evaluated him again. A new abuse investigation was opened against the foster parent, and he was moved to a second foster family \u2014 in this case, a pediatrician and her husband. Once again, the baby developed new bruises, according to his visitation supervisor.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is medical, something weird is going on here,\u201d Ducharme remembered thinking.</p>\n\n<p>But according to notes from the CPS investigator, Harper declined to change her determination or to perform additional blood clotting disorder tests as the first doctor had advised: \u201cWould not be any different now so they did not repeat those tests,\u201d he wrote. He added that in Harper\u2019s opinion, whoever bruised the baby in April was the most likely offender in subsequent incidents.</p>\n\n<p>In her notes, Harper also questioned whether the marks noticed on the baby while he was living with his second foster family were true bruises. Instead, prosecutors posited a new theory in the case: that Ram\u00edrez and Guzm\u00e1n were surreptitiously abusing their son during visits, even though the visits were supervised by a woman who works as an observer in CPS cases. To Ducharme, that strained credulity. He became concerned that Harper was too unwilling to change her diagnoses, and that prosecutors were reluctant to challenge her.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShe has this level of cachet with prosecutors, it\u2019s like a trauma bond. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s right more than 90% of the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re unwilling to see her failures.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But not everyone is. In several cases in recent years, judges and juries have found Harper\u2019s diagnoses unconvincing. In 2024, a Wisconsin judge barred Harper from telling the jury that a child died as the result of \u201cabusive head trauma, non-accidental injury, child abuse, or murder.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDr. Harper sees herself as an advocate, at least in part, and this blurs her role as scientist and clinician with the role of advocate against child abuse, further calling into question her fidelity to the scientific validation of abusive head trauma diagnoses, especially when it is a close call,\u201d the judge said.</p>\n\n<p>In another Wisconsin case, Paul Marshall was found not guilty in 2023 of shaking his 7-week-old son, Fox, to death. Harper examined the boy at Children\u2019s Minnesota, a hospital in St. Paul. A spokesperson for Children\u2019s Minnesota declined to comment on the case.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe were put through the grinder,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe don\u2019t get our son back, and we don\u2019t get a lot of the closure that we should have had as a family. That was robbed from us.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                        \n\n    \n        \n\n                            \n                                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n\n            The Marshalls at home with their two daughters. \u201cWe don\u2019t get our son back, and we don\u2019t get a lot of the closure that we should have had as a family. That was robbed from us,\u201d Paul Marshall said.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n            \n                    \n    \n                    \n<p>After Ducharme became convinced that there was a medical explanation for Ram\u00edrez\u2019s baby\u2019s injuries, he prepared a memo that pointed out a number of possible contributing factors, including that Ram\u00edrez had gone days without eating while she was pregnant and traveling across the U.S.-Mexico border from Colombia and had a difficult delivery in Minneapolis. Ram\u00edrez got her own medical records from Colombia which showed that, as a child, she\u2019d also experienced unexplained bruising.</p>\n\n<p>To challenge the prosecutors\u2019 theory that the baby\u2019s new bruises were from further abuse by the parents, Ducharme spoke to their visitation supervisor. She provided a sworn affidavit saying that she did not witness any abusive behavior from the parents, and that she\u2019d become so stressed in part from the pressure to say she had witnessed abuse that she asked to be taken off the case. She also wrote that CPS workers were lying to and about the couple, claiming that the foster parents spoke Spanish, which they did not, and that Ram\u00edrez and Guzm\u00e1n were unreliable about keeping visitation appointments.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe parents attended every visit. They never cancelled,\u201d the supervisor wrote. \u201cEven when their tire popped on the way to their first supervised visitations, they got an Uber and were only about five minutes late.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A judge ruled that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that the parents were abusing their baby at visits and ordered a second medical opinion. But before that could happen, the county agreed to drop the termination of parental rights petition after Ram\u00edrez and Guzm\u00e1n agreed to acknowledge that their son \u201csustained serious injury\u201d while living with them, without admitting guilt. The case was converted to a regular child protection matter, which allowed the couple to have home visits. They eventually regained custody, and the case was closed in April 2024.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no accountability. There\u2019s no finding of fact,\u201d Ducharme said. \u201cYou think: \u2018You get your baby back. None of the rest of it matters.\u2019 But it matters.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The couple found the entire experience bewildering and traumatic. Although they are now reunited, they missed six months of their newborn son\u2019s life. Ram\u00edrez didn\u2019t have the chance to breastfeed after the first foster parent began feeding her son formula instead of the breast milk she was pumping.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t see him crawl. We didn\u2019t see him turn over \u2014\u201d Guzm\u00e1n said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t see him sit up,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Mar\u00eda Alejandra Ram\u00edrez Rodr\u00edguez and her husband, Cristian Andr\u00e9s Guzm\u00e1n de la Ossa, brought their 4-week-old son to Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis after noticing bruises on his body. After an evaluation by Harper, their son was sent into foster care for months before he was returned to them.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Although they worry about doing anything that might draw attention from immigration authorities, in late May <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25978998-ramirez-guzman-complaint-2025/\">they filed a federal civil lawsuit</a> against Harper and the institutions she works for. Ducharme, who left his job at Hennepin County and is now in private practice, is representing the couple in the lawsuit, which alleges that Harper acted in \u201cbad faith,\u201d and that because of her actions there was no \u201cgenuine investigation\u201d into the baby\u2019s medical condition.</p>\n\n<p>According to a spokesperson for Harper\u2019s employer, University of Minnesota Physicians, they have not been served with the lawsuit yet and have not responded to the allegations.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy, after they didn\u2019t find any physical abuse, did the hospital not keep doing exams to see if there was something medically wrong with him?\u201d Guzm\u00e1n asked. \u201cThey robbed us of our child without any real explanation.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<p>In late May 2023, a year and a half after Hank\u2019s case, Sharon was on his way home from work when he got a phone call. A new case had come into the emergency room at Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital that needed his consultation: a 3-month-old boy named Daniel. An MRI had shown fluid on his brain. CPS was already investigating whether this was abuse.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNot again,\u201d Sharon recalled thinking. He turned his car around.</p>\n\n<p>At the hospital, he learned the unusual circumstances that had brought Daniel to the hospital: His mother, a pediatric nurse, had volunteered her son for an academic study that needed the MRIs of healthy children as a baseline. Someone on the research team noted fluid in Daniel\u2019s brain, and a report was made to child protection services.</p>\n\n<p>After meeting with the parents, examining Daniel and reviewing the MRI report, Sharon wrote up a one-page note. Among other things, he recommended that CPS continue assessing Daniel for possible abuse. But after what had happened with Hank\u2019s case the year before, Sharon also put his views on the record.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOne should practice extreme caution attributing isolated intracranial fluid collection to abusive head trauma when no additional clinical signs or symptoms are found,\u201d he wrote, \u201cas the evidence to support this is controversial and has been questioned by many authorities (medical as well as legal).\u201d</p>\n\n<p>After a day in the hospital, Daniel and his parents, Grace and Paul, were allowed to go home together, although they said the CPS investigation remained open for a month. George, the same doctor involved in Hank\u2019s case, asked Daniel\u2019s parents to bring him back two weeks later, where Grace said he screamed as he was pinned down for additional X-rays and to check for bruises. According to medical records, George determined that Daniel had experienced an \u201caccidental trauma\u201d but did not attribute the cranial fluid to abuse.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, according to Sharon, his supervisor called to tell him that, once again, Harper was concerned about the legal liability created by his note, and that his opinion about the bleeding was \u201cbeyond the scope\u201d of his practice. Struck by the similarities in Daniel\u2019s and Hank\u2019s cases, Sharon wrote another letter reiterating his concerns from the conference call in February 2022. He said that he\u2019d spoken to many colleagues at the hospital who shared those concerns, and that he strongly believed \u201cour organization must acknowledge and address these concerns in a transparent manner.\u201d</p>\n        \n    \n                            \n    \n                    \n<p>In late June, University of Minnesota records show that three complaints were filed within days of one another against Sharon. Because the complaints were closed without discipline, they are protected personnel data under Minnesota law.</p>\n\n<p>The first complaint was filed the same day he said he received an invite to a meeting with Dr. Joseph Neglia, head of the University of Minnesota Medical School\u2019s Department of Pediatrics, physician-in-chief at Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital and one of the people included on the February 2022 call. The second complaint was filed a few days later, while the third came the day before the meeting took place.</p>\n\n<p>According to Sharon, an attorney for University of Minnesota Physicians at the meeting told him he was \u201cweaponizing\u201d his notes. A week and a half after that, Sharon said, Neglia brought him in again and gave him a choice: resign or be terminated on the spot. Sharon was shocked. He ultimately resigned.</p>\n\n<p>Under an agreement with University of Minnesota Physicians, Sharon stayed on the job for several months with strict guidelines, including that he was prohibited from working with the infectious disease division. Neglia warned Sharon in a letter to \u201cmaintain a high level of professionalism and decorum\u201d and not to engage in \u201cany behavior that could be perceived as retaliation,\u201d echoing the language in Gupta\u2019s peer review letter to Sharon.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou will refrain and remove yourself from involvement in any cases of suspected child abuse or potential non-accidental trauma,\u201d Neglia wrote. \u201cThis includes any interactions with or communication with parents or guardians of a patient in such a case.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Neglia did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of his departure, Sharon was one of only a small number of doctors in the country who treated a complicated immune disease with behavioral symptoms in children known by the acronym PANDAS or PANS. Parents of Sharon\u2019s patients were so upset by news of his resignation that <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/doctors-departure-from-the-university-minnesota-a-setback-for-kids-with-rare-traumatic-illness/600317528\">they went to the local newspaper</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The coverage prompted an investigator from the Minnesota Attorney General\u2019s Office to reach out to Sharon, and Sharon said he took the opportunity to share his concerns about the child abuse protocols at his former workplace. He said he has yet to hear back. A spokesperson at the attorney general\u2019s office declined comment.</p>\n\n<p>On a recent April afternoon, Sharon arrived at a restaurant in a suburb of Minneapolis. Tucked in a back corner table was Daniel, now a blond-headed 2-year-old, Grace, Paul and Grace\u2019s mother. Sharon had not seen them since that day in the emergency room two years ago, and the family wanted to thank him for what he\u2019d done. (Because Grace is a pediatric nurse and because she wants to protect her son\u2019s privacy, ProPublica agreed to withhold the families\u2019 full names.)</p>\n\n<p>Grace still feels traumatized by the 24 hours she spent at Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital, not sure if she\u2019d be allowed to take her son home. She remembers that the one person who seemed to be in her corner was Sharon and how it felt to read that single line in her son\u2019s medical report that may have cost Sharon his job.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat was the light in the darkness at that point,\u201d she said.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Daniel with parents, Grace and Paul. Grace still feels traumatized by the 24 hours she spent at Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital, unsure if she\u2019d be allowed to take her son home.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>Since the incident, Grace said, she has had to work with George on cases of suspected child abuse and said she has become more understanding of how parents are treated.</p>\n\n<p>For his part, Sharon characterizes the entire experience as \u201csurreal.\u201d He commutes from Minnesota to Colorado and Wyoming for temporary hospitalist and clinical work, but he is still looking for a full-time job. He wants to get back to treating infectious diseases and thinking about pediatric immunology, and he worries that he could be hurting his own reputation by speaking out about how hospitals deal with cases of suspected child abuse.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, he said he feels that he has to push back against the attempt to get him, and other physicians like him who may disagree with a child abuse pediatrician, to \u201cfall in line.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>After leaving his job, Sharon got a tattoo on the inside of his left forearm, a quote attributed to Albert Einstein he said reflects his thinking and his actions at Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital: \u201cUnthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.\u201d</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/mariam-elba\">Mariam Elba</a> contributed research. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/melissa-sanchez\">Melissa Sanchez</a> and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/Agnel-Philip\">Agnel Philip</a> contributed reporting.</p>",

Sign up to receive <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/the-big-story?source=www.propublica.org&amp;placement=top-note&amp;region=national\">our biggest stories</a> as soon as they\u2019re published.</p>\n\n        \n\n    \n      \n  \n\n\n\n                    \n<p>In 2023, while Kristi Noem was governor of South Dakota, she supplemented her income by secretly accepting a cut of the money she raised for a nonprofit that promotes her political career, tax records show. </p>\n\n<p>In what experts described as a highly unusual arrangement, the nonprofit routed funds to a personal company of Noem\u2019s that had recently been established in Delaware. The payment totaled $80,000 that year, a significant boost to her roughly $130,000 government salary. Since the nonprofit is a so-called dark money group \u2014 one that\u2019s not required to disclose the names of its donors \u2014 the original source of the money remains unknown. </p>\n\n<p>Noem then failed to disclose the $80,000 payment to the public. After President Donald Trump selected Noem to be his secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, she had to release a detailed accounting of her assets and sources of income from 2023 on. She did not include the income from the dark money group on <a href=\"https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/E8FA62012957FA1C85258C130032F362/$FILE/Noem%2C%20Kristi%20%20final278.pdf\">her disclosure form</a>, which experts called a likely violation of federal ethics requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Experts told ProPublica it was troubling that Noem was personally taking money that came from political donors. In a filing, the group, a nonprofit called American Resolve Policy Fund, described <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/932286963/202413209349300031/IRS990ScheduleG\">the $80,000</a> as a payment for fundraising. The organization said Noem had brought in hundreds of thousands of dollars. </p>\n\n<p>There is nothing remarkable about a politician raising money for nonprofits and other groups that promote their campaigns or agendas. What\u2019s unusual, experts said, is for a politician to keep some of the money for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf donors to these nonprofits are not just holding the keys to an elected official\u2019s political future but also literally providing them with their income, that\u2019s new and disturbing,\u201d said Daniel Weiner, a former Federal Election Commission attorney who now leads the Brennan Center\u2019s work on campaign finance.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>ProPublica discovered details of the payment in the annual tax form of American Resolve Policy Fund, which is part of a <a href=\"https://www.theamericanresolve.com/\">network of political groups</a> that promote Noem and her agenda. The nonprofit describes its mission as \u201cfighting to preserve America for the next generation.\u201d There\u2019s little evidence in the public domain that the group has done much. In its first year, its main expenditures were paying Noem and covering the cost of some unspecified travel. It also maintains social media accounts devoted to promoting Noem. It has 100 followers on X.</p>\n\n<p>In a statement, Noem\u2019s lawyer, Trevor Stanley, said, \u201cThen-Governor Noem fully complied with the letter and the spirit of the law\u201d and that the Office of Government Ethics, which processes disclosure forms for federal officials, \u201canalyzed and cleared her financial information in regards to this entity.\u201d Stanley did not respond to follow-up questions about whether the ethics office was aware of the $80,000 payment.</p>\n\n<p>Stanley also said that \u201cSecretary Noem fully disclosed all of her income on public documents that are readily available.\u201d Asked for evidence of that, given that Noem didn\u2019t report the $80,000 payment on her federal financial disclosure form, Stanley did not respond. </p>\n\n<p>Before being named Homeland Security secretary, overseeing immigration enforcement, Noem spent two decades in South Dakota\u2019s government and the U.S. House of Representatives, drawing a public servant\u2019s salary. Her husband, Bryon Noem, runs a small insurance brokerage with two offices in the state. Between his company and his real estate holdings, he has at least $2 million in assets, according to Noem\u2019s filing.</p>\n\n<p>While she is among the least wealthy members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet, her personal spending habits have attracted notice. Noem was photographed wearing a gold <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/style/kristi-noem-venezuela-prison-rolex-watch.html\">Rolex Cosmograph Daytona watch</a> that costs nearly $50,000 as she toured the Salvadoran prison where her agency is sending immigrants. In April, after her purse was stolen at a Washington, D.C., restaurant, it emerged she was carrying <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/noem-felt-bag-dragged-thought-grandchild/story?id=121138202\">$3,000 in cash</a>, which an official said was for \u201cdinner, activities, and Easter gifts.\u201d She was criticized for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/noem-travel-taxpayers-south-dakota-homeland-security-c2655e00a16d44bba46c60a14a638f5d\">using taxpayer money</a> as governor to pay for expenses related to trips to Paris, to Canada for bear hunting and to Houston to have dental work done. At the time, Noem denied misusing public funds. </p>\n\n<p>Noem\u2019s personal company, an LLC called Ashwood Strategies, shares a name with one of her horses. It was registered in Delaware early in her second term as South Dakota governor, around 1 p.m. on June 22, 2023. Four minutes later, the nonprofit American Resolve Policy Fund was incorporated in Delaware too. </p>\n\n<p>American Resolve raised $1.1 million in 2023, according to its <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/932286963/202413209349300031/full\">tax filing</a>. The group reported that it had zero employees, and what it did with that money is largely unclear.</p>\n        \n    \n                    \n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n            Noem\u2019s Ashwood Strategies received an $80,000 fundraising fee in 2023 for raising $800,000 for the nonprofit, according to the group\u2019s tax filing.\n    \n            (Internal Revenue Service. Screenshot and highlights by ProPublica.)\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n                    \n<p>In 2023, the nonprofit spent only about $220,000 of its war chest \u2014 with more than a third of that going to Noem\u2019s LLC. The rest mostly went toward administrative expenses and a roughly $84,000 travel budget. It\u2019s not clear whose travel the group paid for.</p>\n\n<p>The nonprofit reported that it sent the $80,000 fundraising fee to Noem\u2019s LLC as payment for bringing in $800,000, a 10% cut. A professional fundraiser who also raised money for the group was paid a lower rate of 7%. </p>\n\n<p>In the intervening years, American Resolve has maintained a low public profile. In March, it <a href=\"https://www.thedakotascout.com/p/pac-with-ties-to-kristi-noem-behind\">purchased Facebook ads</a> attacking a local news outlet in South Dakota, which had been reporting on Noem\u2019s use of government credit cards. Noem\u2019s lawyer did not answer questions about whether the group paid her more money after 2023, the most recent year for which its tax filing is available.</p>\n\n<p>The nonprofit has an affiliated political committee, American Resolve PAC, that\u2019s been more active, at least in public. Touting Noem\u2019s conservative leadership under a picture of her staring off into the sky, its website said the PAC was created to put \u201cKristi and her team on the ground in key races across America.\u201d Noem traveled the country last year attending events the PAC sponsored in support of Republican candidates.</p>\n\n<p>American Resolve\u2019s treasurer referred questions to Noem\u2019s lawyer. In his statement, Noem\u2019s lawyer said she \u201cdid not establish, finance, maintain, or control American Resolve Fund. She was simply a vender for a non-profit entity.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>While Noem failed to report the fundraising income Ashwood Strategies received on her federal financial disclosure, she did provide some other details. She described the LLC as involving \u201cpersonal activities outside my official gubernatorial capacity\u201d and noted that it received the $140,000 advance for her book \u201cNo Going Back.\u201d The LLC also had a bank account with between $100,001 and $250,000 in it and at least $50,000 of \u201clivestock and equipment,\u201d she reported.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that Ashwood Strategies is Noem\u2019s company only emerged through the confirmation process for her Trump Cabinet post. South Dakota has minimal disclosure rules for elected officials, and Noem had not previously divulged that she created a side business while she was governor.</p>\n\n<p>Noem\u2019s outside income may have run afoul of South Dakota law, according to <a href=\"https://southdakotasearchlight.com/2024/04/05/from-fringe-to-foreground-loose-cannon-lawmaker-departs-as-leading-legislative-voice/\">Lee Schoenbeck</a>, a veteran Republican politician and attorney who was until recently the head of the state Senate. The<a href=\"https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/3-8-1\"> </a><a href=\"https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/3-8-1\">law requires</a> top officials, including the governor, to devote their full time to their official roles.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way the governor is supposed to have a private side business that the public doesn\u2019t know about,\u201d Schoenbeck told ProPublica. \u201cIt would clearly not be appropriate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Noem\u2019s lawyer said South Dakota law allowed her to receive income from the nonprofit.</p>\n        \n             \n\n                                    \n        \n                        <p>Do you have any information we should know about Kristi Noem or other administration officials?

    "description": "<p><strong>EXPERT Q&amp;A \u2014 </strong><em>NATO leaders convened in The Hague this week for a summit aiming to strengthen the alliance's defenses, with the ever encroaching threat of Russia in mind. The meeting was largely a success, with all members (barring Spain) pledging to meet a new 5% GDP defense spending target. It was also a moment for NATO to project unity and recommit to collective defense, following skepticism from the administration of President Donald Trump, who was receptive and praised the alliance \u2014 saying it is not a \"rip-off\" as he has previously said. Ukraine, while a key topic at previous summits in recent years, was notably on the backburner this time around.<br /></em></p><p><em>The Cipher Brief caught up with General Philip Breedlove (Ret.), a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, for a post-summit debrief to see what positives came out of the gathering and where he is looking next, from how NATO members go about expanding defense capabilities to whether the alliance offers more support to Ukraine and pressures Russia. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. You can watch the full discussion at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFz40aEAdyw\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief's YouTube channel</a>.</em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><p><em></em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong><em>Did things end the way you thought they needed to end this week at the Hague?</em></p><p><em>General Breedlove: </em>We had a great summit. Let's give some credit to Secretary General [Mark] Rutte and the members of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) because we needed unity. When the U.S. president arrived, they had come to unity on the 5% spending commitment. And I think that set the stage. Our president was the first president in the history of NATO to get the organization to seriously invest when he pushed hard on the 2%. So, it went very well.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong></em><em>This felt like a summit that was almost tailor-made for the president. It was an easy pop-in, not a lot of debate, not a lot of back and forth. They knew what to expect going into it. Do you think that that helped fuel the outcome?</em></p><p><em><strong>General Breedlove:</strong> </em>Yes. Very few people understand how NATO works. The secretary general is actually very important, but he's not the decider. He works for the NAC, just like the Supreme Allied Commander of Europe (SACEUR) works for the NAC. Secretary General Rutte has managed the process extremely well to get everybody to where he needed them to be. We need to give him some credit for organizing all of the nations to get them to the right place.</p><p>I think their vision was to keep this short, to the point, get to the things that the U.S. president wants to accomplish, get those accomplished, and come out of this with a big unifying statement. And who is that unifying statement for? Of course, it's for all of our nations and our alliance. But the most important recipient of that message is Mr. Putin.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief Threat Conference is happening October 19-22 in Sea Island, GA.

He tries to peel off individual countries and leaders. Secretary General Rutte pulled the team together, got them on the same playbook, moved out and didn't waste any time. And I think that's exactly how this U.S. president likes to work.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: </strong></em><em>It was clear going into this that Russia is the real threat to NATO. It's still a little bit unclear as to where President Trump is going to come down on Russia when it comes to how much pressure he's going to be willing to apply. We saw a little bit of movement toward the possibility of more support for Ukraine. What do you think the options are there? And if you\u2019re the Russian president, how are you looking at the outcome of this summit in particular?</em></p><p><em>General Breedlove</em><em>: </em>I'm both encouraged and discouraged on this front. I think there are a lot of people who believe we're ready now and we should be going in with the next round of heavy sanctions on Russia, to go after fuels and the shadow fleet. Our U.S. secretary of state, in his statement, said we're not going there now because it might preclude some sort of a ceasefire or peace agreement in Ukraine. So, he's going to hold off. Russia won that round. That's what they want. Keep stalling, keep the Americans thinking there's going to be a deal, and keep attacking Ukraine. So, we've got to move past that. And I think eventually this is going to happen.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

A key component is the 1.5% dedicated to defense- and security-related spending, a broad category that covers everything from critical infrastructure cybersecurity to upgrading transportation infrastructure for military logistics. Experts say this is a needed area to bolster defense posture, in addition to the traditional purchase of jets, tanks and arms.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Earlier this week, Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery urged NATO to adopt the 1.5% commitment in a </em></em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/nato-s-critical-1-5-percent\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><em>piece in The Cipher Brief</em></em></u></a><em><em>.

Success or still a lot of work?</em></p><p><em><strong><em>RADM Montgomery: </em></strong></em>I think with an alliance like NATO, there is always a lot of work. You've got 32 countries, you have 32 ideas, you have 32 threat assessments. But I actually think it went exceptionally well. It went exceptionally well because Secretary General Rutte did a great job corralling the players, with the exception of Spain. But he did a great job with 31, and then he did a terrific job managing President Trump \u2014 and that's no easy feat.</p><p>This was a landmark summit. The Hague 2025 will be remembered for a true commitment to deterring Russia, and if necessary defeating them if they were to invade a NATO state. And the five percent is certainly part of it, but the language, the direction, the focus, the corralling back in of the United States, all that happened at this summit.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Craving more expert insights into national security? Subscribe to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxe0CtWYQdk\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s YouTube channel</a> to watch our interview with RADM Mark Montgomery.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em>One thing that wasn't really discussed in any kind of depth was Ukraine. Obviously with Russia being sort of the looming cloud over NATO, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on that.</em></p><p><em><strong><em>RADM Montgomery: </em></strong></em>I fully support Ukraine and I think we should do as much as we can to help them. I recognize, though, that this 5 percent and the discussion of whether Article 5 applies really was about signatory states. There's a deep, deep issue there that we have to be agreed that we're going to defend Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, particularly. I think they're the four most vulnerable states if they're attacked.</p><p>Separate from that is the issue that right now the European country in combat with Russia that was illegally invaded by Russia, Ukraine, has relied heavily on NATO support because most of NATO recognizes that if you don't deter Russia here, their next ambition could be Moldova, but it could be Estonia. It could be Romania or Georgia, or it could be the Suwalki Gap and a land bridge to Kaliningrad.</p><p>So with all that in play, it was critical that Zelensky got a good reception. I think he did. And the fact that the Ukrainian section was shortened from 42 paragraphs to 10 paragraphs, I don't care. In the end it said we support Ukraine. The NATO contact group is working hard to support Ukraine. European countries are giving Ukraine a lot of money.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

There is no European alternative to the Patriot line at Raytheon or to the AMRAAM line in the United States, which is the weapon that goes in their NASAMs air defense system. There's no European alternative to a million rounds a year of 155mm. You're going to need the U.S. to be involved in that. And therefore, it was critical for the president to say that these lines are available to Ukraine. And he did that on two or three different occasions. It wasn't as clean as I'd like it, but he clearly indicated that was his intention.</p><p><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em></strong></em><em>Next steps for NATO. What do you think?</em></p><p><em><strong><em>RADM Montgomery: </em></strong></em>First, glad to see the 5%. I was really glad that they broke it down to 3.5-1.5, mostly because they'd have never gotten a 5% on planes, tanks, and ships. You'd have had more than Spain break away then \u2014 you might've had the UK, France, and Germany. Or they'd put a due date like 2050, something that doesn't really matter. I'm disappointed it slipped to 2035. It should have been 2032 like the Eastern Europeans wanted. Most of the Eastern Europeans, by the way\u2014Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Poland\u2014are passing through 4% already and heading to 5% within the next 12 months. And that's just on aircraft, ships, and tanks kind of stuff.</p><p>What I really loved about this was the 1.5%. This is about getting cyber right and critical infrastructure protection right. It's about building your defense industrial base. But talking about cyber and critical infrastructure, when you say what's next for NATO, at the last summit, they approved a NATO critical infrastructure center. They put it at SACEUR, and that's critical because what we have to do now is take that center as it comes online in the next year, SACEUR\u2019s war plans, and this money and build the infrastructure that's necessary for the United States to flow our forces from the United States, the UK forces from across the channel, the French forces from deep in Europe\u2014those brigades, divisions, and even corps\u2014to be able to flow across Northern Europe from the ports and the airfields in Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Luxembourg, France, and get to the fight. That is not protected right now. That critical infrastructure is not prioritized and protected in a meaningful way. </p><p>So, in my mind, the big NATO takeaway is 1.5 percent, the cyber center, and a SACEUR with a war plan. If we can now build ourselves the ligature to deter Russia and if Russia is foolish enough to attack, defeat Russia in an invasion of an Article Five-defended country.</p><p><em><strong><em>Are you Subscribed to</em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong> </strong></em><u><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> on YouTube?

On that last and arguably most important front, the gathering at The Hague produced surprising results. </p><p>By the end of the summit, President Donald Trump\u2019s famous disdain for NATO had morphed into a gush. \u201cThis was a tremendous summit,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/world/europe/nato-increase-military-spending-trump.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the president said</a> at a news conference, \u201cI enjoyed it very much.\u201d </p><p>Trump spoke in glowing terms about the alliance - \u201cI left here differently,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/25/trump-nato-iran-ukraine/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a> and promised U.S. support for NATO\u2019s Article 5, which compels each member state to respond to an attack against any other, and which he had previously called into question. Trump was also clearly pleased with the summit\u2019s main achievement \u2013 a collective pledge by members to contribute 5% of their GDP to defense, something the U.S. president had wanted for years.</p><p>Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges (Ret.), former Commander of U.S. Army Forces in Europe, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em> that the summit\u2019s \u201cbest outcome\u201d was NATO\u2019s success at bringing Trump back into the fold.</p><p>\u201cThere was a huge sigh of relief in The Hague that he even showed up, Hodges told us. \u201cThere was some anxiety about that, or that he might blow it up somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was there, he stayed for the entire thing. He met with President Zelensky. We got an agreement on 5 % [spending]...and then a public affirmation of American commitment to the alliance by the president. That's pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually think it went exceptionally well,\u201d said Rear Admiral (Ret.) Mark Montgomery, a senior member of the <a href=\"http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cyber Initiatives Group</a> and director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cIt went exceptionally well because NATO Secretary General [Mark] Rutte did a great job corralling the players\u2026and then he did a terrific job managing President Trump and that's no easy feat.\u201d </p><p>The costs of placating the U.S. president included hitting that 5% figure, which may be difficult for many members to meet, and a relegating of Ukraine\u2019s concerns to the summit\u2019s back burner.</p><p> At The Hague, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was pleased by what <a href=\"https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/4008310-zelensky-on-meeting-with-trump-we-spoke-about-how-to-achieve-ceasefire-real-peace.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he called</a> a \u201clong and meaningful\u201d meeting with President Trump, and Trump himself acknowledged Ukraine\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/as-nato-summit-fawns-over-daddy-trump-ukraine-gets-only-words-of-comfort/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">brave battle\u201d</a> in a way he hasn\u2019t done previously. Still, some in Ukraine noted that beyond verbal support from Trump and Rutte, there was little new NATO support for Kyiv.</p><p>\u201cThe problem for Ukrainians is that we are super tired from so many words,\u201d Oleksiy Goncharenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. He noted that June had been one of the worst months of the war in terms of civilian deaths, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been \u201cemboldened\u201d by a failure of the U.S. to hold Moscow accountable. \u201cWe want to see concrete results,\u201d Goncharenko said. \u201cWe want this war to end as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe NATO allies made some brutal and to some extent also cynical trade-offs,\u201d Liana Fix, a Europe expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, told <em>The Cipher Brief</em>. \u201cThey wanted the summit to be a success for Donald Trump and to be about defense spending to secure their own security in the long term. It was not designed to be about Ukraine.\u201d</p><p><strong>A Trump surprise</strong></p><p>President Trump\u2019s pivot didn\u2019t just help with the atmospherics at The Hague. For the moment at least, it means that a bitter and dangerous NATO-U.S. rift has been mended. </p><p>Trump has mused out loud about ending U.S. financial and military commitments to NATO. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/20/trump-says-the-us-doesnt-have-to-meet-nato-spending-goal-00416154\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a> he saw no reason for the U.S. to meet the very 5% spending target he had pushed for \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think we should,\u201d he said \u2013 and on the eve of the summit he <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-iran-israel-nato-e34385f9b6e2ff5d0cf60f8aaea57a40\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">refused to commit</a> to U.S. support for Article 5. It \u201c<a href=\"https://semafor.com/s/i3H1R9WFxZ?email=tgnagorski@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">depends on your definition</a>,\u201d he said.</p><p>All that seemed like rear-view-mirror material by the time the summit wrapped at The Hague. Rutte\u2019s pre-summit flattering of Trump \u2013 including a leaked <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114738606142462442\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">private message</a> in which he praised the U.S. strikes against Iran and told the president he was \u201cflying into another big success in The Hague\u201d \u2013 seemed to have had the desired effect. Trump praised Rutte and the alliance, took credit for the spending pledges, and sought to put to rest any doubts about Washington\u2019s Article 5 commitments. \u201cI stand with it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d Trump said when asked to clarify his position. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t stand with it, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>That full-throated support allowed for a final <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_236705.htm?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=posts&amp;utm_campaign=250625%2Bmulti%2Bdeclaration\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">summit communiqu\u00e9</a> that included a reaffirmation of the \u201cironclad commitment to collective defense as enshrined in Article 5.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was important that the president affirmed it very strongly, clearly and publicly,\u201d Lt. Gen. Hodges told us. </p><p>\u201cDonald Trump committed to Article 5, but European NATO members paid a high price for that,\u201d Fix said. \u201cThe whole summit was about offering 5% to Donald Trump, flattering him and making sure that he stays in the alliance. Of course, it's also in the interest of European NATO allies to increase their defense spending, but they would have never come up with this 5% target. That was specifically for Donald Trump, and it worked.\u201d</p><p>Rutte also managed to achieve near consensus among the NATO members \u2013 32 of them \u2013 with the exception of Spain \u2013 committed to the 5 % ask; ultimately it was split into 3.5 % for core military elements \u2013 troops, missiles, ammunition \u2013 and another 1.5 percent for \u201cmilitarily adjacent\u201d spending that nations may devote to infrastructure and cybersecurity.</p><p>That drew praise from Rear Adm. Montgomery, who had advocated for the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/nato-s-critical-1-5-percent\" target=\"_self\">additional commitment</a>.</p><p>\u201cWhat I really loved about this was the 1.5 %,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about getting cyber right and critical infrastructure protection right.\u201d</p><p>Beyond the detailed spending targets, experts saw value in the unified message put forth at the summit, given recent transatlantic tensions.</p><p>\u201cThe degree to which the alliance acts in a unified voice, utilizes consensus, agrees on broad positions, that's a win for the alliance and a big defeat for Putin,\u201d Admiral James Stavridis, a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, <a href=\"https://thecipherbrief.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9775ab595d580738d839f9d01&amp;id=abf3e0c36b&amp;e=abcf227f11\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told <em>The Cipher Brief</em></a>. </p><p><strong>The skeptics \u2013 and the hurdles ahead</strong></p><p>For all the post-summit cheering, there was also skepticism about the implementation of the new 5 % commitments. </p><p>While Poland and the Baltic states are <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2025/04/14/sharing-the-burden-how-poland-and-germany-are-shifting-the-dial-on-european-defence-expenditure/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">already spending</a> nearly 5% of their GDP on defense, other NATO members hover close to 2% and will face political and economic challenges in meeting the new targets. Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez <a href=\"http://v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">refused</a> to sign on, saying his country would spend 2.1 percent of its GDP on defense, \u201cno more, no less.\u201d Slovakia and Belgium pledged to meet the target but said it would be difficult to do.</p><p>Experts noted that in the push to placate President Trump, NATO\u2019s European members had <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/nato-leaders-set-back-trump-defence-spending-goal-hague-summit-2025-06-24/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">agreed</a> to more than double their military spending at a time when many are already struggling to balance their budgets. Politically, these governments \u2013 particularly those in Western Europe, where the Russia threat is less palpable \u2013 may have trouble convincing their constituents that military spending should spike at the expense of outlays for social programs. </p><p>\u201cTo what extent will populists in Europe make defense spending a topic?\u201d asked Fix. \u201cDo they come up with claims like, \u2018Why should we spend for defense just to please Donald Trump? We could spend for social welfare and make a deal with Russia.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Then there is the timetable.</p><p>The NATO communique calls for members to meet their 5% target by 2035. Experts and some intelligence agencies have warned that while Russia\u2019s military and economy have been weakened, new Russian threats to Europe may arise within three to five years of an end of the Ukraine war. </p><p>Hodges and Montgomery both said they were disappointed by the long timeline. The Ukrainian president did too. </p><p>\u201cThis is slow,\u201d <a href=\"https://time.com/7297698/nato-2025-summit-trump-iran-ukraine-defense-topics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zelensky said</a> of the NATO timeline. \u201cWe believe starting in 2030, Putin can have significantly greater capabilities. Today, Ukraine is holding him up, he has no time to drill the army.\u201d </p><p>Finally, there is the question of how the money will be spent. As <em>The Cipher Brief </em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/can-europe-really-defend-itself\" target=\"_self\">has reported</a>, European defense production has often been slowed or thwarted by continent-wide <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/06/19/this-weeks-nato-summit-will-be-all-about-placating-donald-trump\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">regulations</a>. And while overall defense strategy and standards have been set by NATO commanders, national military budgets and planning are decided by individual nations. Experts stressed the need for NATO\u2019s European members to spend their 5% in a strategic and coordinated fashion.</p><p>\u201cThe most important thing, of course, is capability,\u201d Lt. Gen. Hodges said. \u201cDo we have the actual capability to do what we're supposed to do? Because that's what will deter the Russians, not a sign on the board that says, Hey, we're at 3.5 percent. You know, it's real capability, units that are properly trained, fully manned, that have lots of ammunition, aircraft that fly and ships that sail. That's got to be the focus.\u201d</p><p><strong>Ukraine on the \u201cback burner\u201d</strong></p><p>Russia\u2019s full-scale of invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was the catalyst for a unified NATO front that had eluded the alliance since the end of the Cold War. This week, with the focus on NATO\u2019s overall defense spending, the recent <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts-assess-strikes-response-and-what-comes-next\" target=\"_self\">strikes against Iran</a>, and the wish to please President Trump, support for Ukraine took a back seat.</p><p>The good news for Ukraine came in the 50-minute meeting Trump held with Zelensky on the summit\u2019s sidelines. Trump spoke of the bravery of Ukrainians and said he would consider providing <a href=\"https://thecipherbrief.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9775ab595d580738d839f9d01&amp;id=3b74622b67&amp;e=abcf227f11\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more Patriot missiles to Ukraine</a> to counter Russian air strikes. \"We are going to see if we can make some of them available,\" Trump said. He also did not reject the idea of approving more U.S. military aid to Kyiv. </p><p>But there were no fresh commitments from NATO, only a general pledge of \u201ccontinued support\u201d for Ukraine. The communiqu\u00e9 made no promise of Ukraine\u2019s future membership in the alliance, which was taken as another concession to Trump, who opposes inviting Ukraine to join NATO. And Fix noted that NATO did not publish a Russia strategy at the summit, presumably over a concern that the U.S. would object \u2013 given the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to recognize Russia as the aggressor in the Ukraine war.</p><p>\u201cThis is my biggest disappointment from this summit, that Ukraine was put on a back burner,\u201d Lt. Gen. Hodges said. \u201cI'm glad that President Zelensky showed up, that he was invited and that he attended. I'm glad that President Trump met with President Zelensky\u2026and he was more positive about Ukraine than I'd heard from him in quite some time. But I had hoped that this summit would be another affirmation by the alliance that we're going to do everything we can to help Ukraine.\u201d </p><p>Goncharenko and other members of the Ukrainian parliament were particularly exasperated by the Trump administration\u2019s rationale for not imposing fresh sanctions against Russia. Trump threatened such sanctions following Russia\u2019s recent military strikes and Putin\u2019s intransigence at the negotiating table, but on the eve of the summit, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said sanctions were off the table for now. </p><p>\u201cIf we come in and crush them with more sanctions, we probably lose our ability to talk to them,\u201d Rubio said. </p><p>\u201cI really can't understand it,\u201d Goncharenko said. \u201cSo, in the case of Iran, to make them go to the negotiating table, their nuclear facilities were crushed by American bombing. And it looks like it worked, at least it looks like that for the moment. In the case of Russia, they say, if we crush them, we will lose the possibility to negotiate. I can't understand.\u201d</p><p>Goncharenko argued that the opposite would be a more logical approach. \u201cIf you want to have Russia at the negotiating table with seriousness, you need to crush them first,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don't understand any language except the language of strength.\u201d </p><p>Montgomery was more hopeful \u2013 for Ukraine and for Europe\u2019s overall posture toward Russia. </p><p>\u201cThe Hague 2025 will be remembered as where there was a true commitment to deterring Russia, and if necessary, defeating them if they were to invade a NATO state,\u201d Montgomery told us. \u201cAnd the 5 percent is certainly part of it, but the language, the direction, the focus, the crawling back of the United States, all that happened at this summit.\u201d</p><p><em><strong>This is exclusive Subscriber+Member content. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Are you Subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</a> on YouTube?

    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/north-korea-abudction-nuclear-enrichment",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>In September 2002, North Korea\u2019s supreme leader, Kim Jong-il, admitted to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi that North Korea had abducted thirteen Japanese citizens \u2014 saying that eight were dead and five could visit Japan and return to North Korea. The Japanese public was shocked. Eight dead? At Japan\u2019s request, North Korea returned the remains of two, Megumi Yokota and Kaoru Matsuki to Japan for forensic analysis. The analysis determined the remains did not belong to either person.</p><p>In October 2002, President George W. Bush sent Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia/Pacific Affairs, James Kelly, to Pyongyang for meetings with North Korea\u2019s Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju. During their meeting, Mr. Kang admitted that North Korea had an active gas centrifuge program to enrich uranium for use in nuclear weapons. He rhetorically asked what the U.S. was prepared to do about such a program. The meeting then ended abruptly.</p><p>These are the two issues that continue to poison relations with North Korea. The Mr. Koizumi visit to North Korea was done in the spirit of improving relations; the ideal outcome was North Korea apologizing and returning all the Japanese citizens they abducted and adhering to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and other nuclear commitments, given that in 1998 North Korea launched a long-range Taepo Dong missile that flew over Japan. Mr. Koizumi\u2019s meeting with Mr. Kim was not the success it was meant to be. The Japanese public was irate with the results of the visit.</p><p>To date, the abductee issue continues to be unresolved, with a mandate from the people that there be closure on this sordid chapter of Japan-North Korea relations. Yokota Sakie, the mother of Yokota Megumi, who was a first-year junior high school student when she was abducted in 1977, recently had a press conference imploring the government to bring back the abductees. Ms. Sakie is the only surviving parent of the government-recognized abductees who remain unaccounted for.</p><p>Japan recognizes seventeen citizens abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 80s; five returned to Japan in 2002, but the other twelve are unaccounted for. There are other estimates that there were hundreds of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea during that period.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong><em>Are you Subscribed to </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief\u2019s Digital Channel</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.</em></strong></em></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>North Korea\u2019s highly enriched uranium program continues to be the major stumbling block in resolving the nuclear issue with North Korea. When North Korea was confronted in 2002 with intelligence indicating a clandestine uranium enrichment program for nuclear weapons, Mr. Kang did not deny it; rather, he apparently made it clear that there was nothing the U.S. \u2013 and others \u2013 could do about it. It also speaks to North Korea\u2019s long-held determination to be a nuclear weapons state. So, despite the Agreed Framework of 1994 that was meant to end North Korea\u2019s quest for a nuclear weapon, Pyongyang decided to pursue a clandestine program to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.</p><p>Indeed, North Korea is now quite open about this uranium enrichment program. The failure of the 2019 Hanoi Summit was due to Mr. Kim\u2019s unwillingness to include his uranium enrichment sites, in addition to the Yongbyon plutonium site, in a deal to lift sanctions in return for a halt in all nuclear programs. In fact, Mr. Kim recently visited another enrichment site, apparently at Yongbyon, where he was shown pictures of shining centrifuges.</p><p>North Korea continues to produce fissile material \u2013 plutonium and enriched uranium \u2013 for nuclear weapons, while enhancing their ballistic missile capabilities, with a Hwasong-18, a solid fuel Intercontinental missile (ICBM) capable of targeting the whole of the U.S. Most recently, Mr. Kim talked about North Korea\u2019s goal of having a blue water navy, which would give North Korea considerable reach in international waters, an obvious threat to Japan and other neighboring countries. </p><p>North Korea\u2019s enhanced nuclear and missile programs and their mutual defense treaty with Russia, with over 11,000 North Korean troops in Russia for the war with Ukraine \u2013 in addition to ballistic missiles and artillery and rocket launchers \u2013 requires immediate attention.</p><p>On June 26 there will be an online symposium in the United Nations on the abduction issue. I and hopefully many others will tune in to this symposium, given that it\u2019s an \u201congoing problem and an international challenge that requires immediate resolution.\u201d </p><p><em><strong><em>This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jun/24/abduction-uranium-enrichment-two-issues-poisoning-us-relations-north/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em><strong><em>The Washington Times</em></strong></em></u></a></p><p><em><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in </em></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\"><u><em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief</em></strong></em></u></a><em><strong><em> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</em></strong></em></p>",

Gen. <a href=\"https://newsroom.consilium.europa.eu/events/20250528-eumc-chairmanship-handover-ceremony\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sean Clancy,</a> head of the European Union\u2019s military committee, recently called a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/business/europe-nato-defense-spending.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cglobal reset.</a>\u201d NATO members have agreed ahead of this week\u2019s summit to boost defense spending to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/23/trumps-5percent-nato-spend-target-very-very-difficult-to-meet-greek-pm.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5% of GDP</a>, a huge jump from a 2% target that many in the alliance had struggled to meet. That change is an acknowledgement of both the growing Russian menace and Trump\u2019s threat to withhold support from NATO nations who miss the 5 % mark. </p><p>Trump has also made clear that the U.S. plans to reduce its financial and troop commitments to NATO, and he has shown disdain for the alliance\u2019s European members. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/20/trump-says-the-us-doesnt-have-to-meet-nato-spending-goal-00416154\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump argued that</a> the 5 % NATO target wouldn't apply to the U.S. \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think we should,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think they should.\u201d And as Europe worked a diplomatic channel to bring Iran to the negotiating table, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-giving-iran-window-table-struck-2-days/story?id=123081689\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump said Friday</a> that \"Iran doesn't want to speak to Europe. They want to speak to us. Europe is not going to be able to help in this one.\"</p><p>\u201cEurope is facing a decision point, a crossroads,\u201d Doug Lute, a former U.S. Ambassador to NATO, told The Cipher Brief. \u201cAnd the decision is, will Europe stand up as one of the poles in this new multipolar international system?\u201d</p><p>Another former U.S. Ambassador to NATO, Kurt Volker, said he believes the U.S. commitment to Europe will remain strong, but only if NATO\u2019s European members make good on their new pledges to boost defense spending. </p><p>\u201cWhat I see is a tremendous U.S. push to strengthen NATO,\u201d Amb. Volker said. \u201cThe U.S. has responsibilities globally and especially in Asia and wants to be able to dedicate more resources there. But it can only dedicate more resources and attention if Europe steps up to do more of its own role in securing Europe and in preparing for the defense of Europe, which they are doing.\u201d</p><p>The question, then, for Europe, as the NATO leaders meet: When it comes to defense and security, can Europe go it alone? Or, as Amb. Lute put it, \u201cCan [Europe] assemble the hard power it needs in a rapid, emergency basis under the pressure of time? Can it assemble the hard power required to stand by itself?\u201d </p><p><strong>What Europe is saying \u2013 and doing</strong> </p><p>Recent European pledges and military budgets would suggest that at a minimum, the European \u201creset\u201d is underway \u2013 and that the continent is taking significant first steps to bolster its own defenses. </p><p>To win consensus on the new 5 % spending target, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte split the commitments into 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for \u201cdefense-related\u201d items including infrastructure and cybersecurity.</p><p>5 % may seem a small figure, but it represents a quantum leap for the alliance. Today only 23 of the <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49198.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">alliance\u2019s 32 members</a> have met the previous 2% target. (<a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49198.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NATO estimates</a> that the U.S. spent around <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2024/6/pdf/240617-def-exp-2024-en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3.4% of its GDP</a> on defense in 2024.) The percentages of defense spending were higher during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union posed a clear and regular threat to Western Europe from its side of the Iron Curtain. The numbers dropped precipitously after the Soviet state met its demise in 1991.</p><p>\u201cAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, everybody cashed in and defense spending in Europe fell,\u201d Amb. Volker said. Today, he added, \u201ceveryone recognizes that Europe has taken too much of a peace dividend and they're not prepared. So that's why they're willing to agree to this 5 % target now.\u201d</p><p>NATO has <a href=\"https://semafor.com/s/XicqOC7FOq?email=tgnagorski@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">also pledged</a> to boost its <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-03/nato-is-pushing-for-fivefold-boost-to-ground-based-air-defenses\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">surface-to-air defense</a> capabilities, an area in which the alliance has depended heavily on the U.S. And in March, the European Union took steps of its own to boost military spending, creating a <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/05/27/safe-council-adopts-150-billion-boost-for-joint-procurement-on-european-security-and-defence/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">150 billion Euro ($170 billion) </a><a href=\"https://behorizon.org/european-defence-readiness-2030-a-new-blueprint-for-strategic-autonomy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\u201ccombat readiness\u201d</a> fund for weapons procurement. </p><p>Meanwhile, that 1.5 % allotment for infrastructure and cybersecurity is an \u201cunderappreciated component\u201d of the European commitment, according to Rear Admiral (Ret.) Mark Montgomery, a senior director at the <a href=\"https://www.fdd.org/projects/center-on-cyber-and-technology-innovation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation</a> (CCTI) at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. In a piece for The Cipher Brief titled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/nato-s-critical-1-5-percent\" target=\"_self\">Nato\u2019s Critical 1.5 %,\u201d</a> Montgomery said those funds would be \u201cfundamental to NATO\u2019s ability to project power and sustain forces to fight and win wars.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Everyone needs a good nightcap.

Philip Breedlove told <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cROAM6U0Wm0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cipher Brief.</a></em> He said that a recent tour of eight European countries had convinced him of a broad commitment to spending for \u201clong-term readiness\u201d on defense. </p><p>\u201cMost capitals have determined [that] Mr. Putin is not a partner, he's an enemy,\u201d Gen. Breedlove said. \u201cHe has now three times amassed an army and marched across internationally recognized borders and invaded his neighbors, and we're going to have to deal with him.\u201d </p><p>Beyond the alliance-wide hikes in defense spending, several European countries have made dramatic moves to bolster their own militaries. Earlier this month the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/uk-expand-submarine-fleet-defence-review-calls-warfighting-readiness-2025-06-01/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">British Defense Ministry</a> announced an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-strategic-defence-review-2025-making-britain-safer-secure-at-home-strong-abroad\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">overhaul</a> of its procurement approach, shifting from a focus on heavy armor to smaller, high-tech weaponry. Germany\u2019s chancellor Friedrich Merz <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/friedrich-merz-germany-bundestag-europe-conventional-army/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">has promised</a> to build \u201cthe strongest conventional <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/can-germany-build-europe-strongest-military-ukraine-russia-army-2025-5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">army in Europe</a>,\u201d and earlier this year Germany made its first permanent foreign deployment since World War II, stationing a 5,000-strong brigade in Lithuania. </p><p>\u201cGermany's economy has awakened to this new military-industrial demand signal, especially under new Chancellor Merz,\u201d Amb. Lute said. \u201cThere are step-by-step indicators that Europe has changed its perception of the threat, the direct threat to Europe, but also this change in the transatlantic relationship.\u201d </p><p>For all the pledges, problems abound. Experts warn that a morass of national and continent-wide <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/06/19/this-weeks-nato-summit-will-be-all-about-placating-donald-trump\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">regulations</a> may thwart or delay efforts to build a potent European defense force. Overall strategy and standards have traditionally been set by NATO commanders, but national military budgets, planning and purchasing are the purview of individual nations. And Amb. Lute warned that European political swings may also hamper efforts to jump-start military production. </p><p>\u201cThe government [in Germany] can't simply demand that Rheinmetall, for example, begin to produce where it hasn't produced in the last 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cYou actually have to enter into the capital marketplace. And that counts on a significant and reliable year-after-year demand signal, which has not been the case over the last three decades.\u201d</p><p><strong>Geography matters</strong> </p><p>The most concrete signs of a continent on a war footing can be found along the eastern edges of NATO, in places where proximity to Russia has driven defense policy. While Spain, which sits in southwest Europe, far from any Russian border, spent only 1.3 % on defense last year, <a href=\"http://v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Poland</a> \u2013 which shares a long border with Ukraine as well as a powerful enmity towards Moscow \u2013 has nearly reached the 5 % threshold already. Meanwhile, NATO\u2019s two biggest military spenders per capita are the <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2025/04/estonia-approves-3-2b-defense-spending-spike-locks-in-5-4-percent-gdp-target/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Baltic nations</a> of Estonia and Lithuania; Latvia is close behind. </p><p>\u201cThe most fundamental observation here is that geography still counts,\u201d Amb. Lute said. \u201cSo the closer you are with a land border to Russia and now a newly aggressive, revanchist, neo-imperialist Putin's Russia, the more these hard defensive measures count.\u201d</p><p>Such measures reach beyond military spending. This month NATO held its annual Baltops military exercises, with troops from 20 NATO nations including newly-minted alliance members Sweden and Finland. This year\u2019s drills carried two main aims, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/briefing/2025/05/08/would-vladimir-putin-attack-nato?utm_campaign=r.twib-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email.internal-newsletter.np&amp;utm_source=salesforce-marketing-cloud&amp;utm_term=5/31/2025&amp;utm_id=2084283\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NATO officials said</a>: to test NATO\u2019s readiness for a Russian attack, and put on a show of force that might deter <a href=\"https://click.e.economist.com/?qs=2a1a7489d4af704e47379e58d0ce90f75adab9fab12941322b9108ff3e12fc63ddfe20a25ddfbaf4d174e1e9f36b1b154362fc25373d3800\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the Kremlin</a> from future aggression. </p><p>Meanwhile, five European nations\u2014Finland, Poland, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania\u2014are <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/11/europe/europe-countries-landmine-ban-russia-intl?cid=ios_app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">withdrawing</a> from the international treaty that bans the use or production of anti-personnel landmines, again citing the Russia threat. And Poland has gone so far as to <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/why-polands-president-wants-us-nuclear-weapons/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">request</a> that NATO nuclear weapons be stationed on its soil. </p><p>\u201cDoesn't surprise me at all,\u201d Gen. Breedlove said of the landmine decision and Poland\u2019s remarks about nuclear weapons. </p><p>\u201cRemember, these nations now are really trying to decide, is America a reliable ally or not?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they're going to have to go it alone, they're going to have to take some pretty tough measures to make sure that they can hold, should Russia do what they seem to be continuing to do\u2026and they're going to start taking these more drastic measures because you just can't bet your national sovereignty and existence on a hope.\u201d </p><p><strong>The missing pieces in a European defense</strong></p><p>A r<a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/research-paper/2025/05/defending-europe-without--the-united-states-costs-and-consequences/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ecent report</a> from the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimates that it would take Europe 25 years and <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/research-paper/2025/05/defending-europe-without--the-united-states-costs-and-consequences/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">nearly $1 trillion</a> to replace U.S. military support if Washington withdrew from the continent. </p><p>The report found that key gaps for NATO members would involve aircraft, naval forces, and command infrastructure. NATO officials <a href=\"https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/russia-could-strike-nato-within-five-years-warns-chief/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">have also warned</a> that current air defenses may be inadequate to protect against the range of threats that have featured prominently in the Ukraine war \u2013 high-tech drones, missiles, and fighter aircraft. </p><p>The IISS report makes clear \u2013 and many experts agree \u2013 that for all the commitments to boost European defenses, the continent remains heavily reliant on U.S. capabilities. </p><p>\u201cWhere America is absolutely the key is all of the enablers, all of the things that make an army potent \u2013 long-range precise fires, deep technical intelligence, developing kill chains and target folders in order to strike,\u201d Gen. Breedlove said. He said he sees minimal immediate risk to Europe, given a badly weakened Russian military, but that in the longer term, the Europeans will need to manufacture or obtain a long list of high-end hardware on their own. </p><p>\u201cThere are a few things that really only America can do,\u201d Gen. Breedlove said, listing rapid aerial transport, high-performing air defenses such as Patriot missile batteries, and sophisticated intelligence systems. \u201cThey really don't have the kind of strategic lift that America brings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe're not talking about tank brigades or ships at sea and so forth,\u201d Amb. Lute said. \u201cWe're talking about things like a high-end missile and air defense. Think of the Patriot missile system, which really doesn't have a European rival\u2026the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and in particular, space-based ISR capabilities. We're talking about air-to-air refueling and that strategic mobility, which is the combination of air-to-air refueling and large-body transport aircraft. So systems like that, for which Europe has relied on the United States, are going to have to become increasingly European owned and operated.\u201d</p><p>Lute and others say a fundamental problem for Europe will be that even if the will and funding are there, none of these systems can be produced quickly. It may be that in the short term, while manufacturers in Europe reboot, they will need to spend their money on purchases from American defense firms. </p><p>Amb. Volker said he remains optimistic about Europe\u2019s defense future, provided it maintains its current level of resolve. </p><p>Filling the gap \u201cis not rocket science, it's easy to do,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope needs to be strategic about this.\u201d </p><p>Volker said that while those high-end \u201cenablers\u201d should be a long-term aspiration, Europe\u2019s near-term focus should be on more nuts-and-bolts defense capabilities \u2014 troops, armor, artillery, ammunition, aircraft, and so forth.</p><p>Ultimately, he said, while some countries will reach the 5 % spending target more quickly than others, the consensus on the gravity of the threat is a good sign. </p><p>\u201cThe fact that they are agreeing to the target means that there is a recognition that it's needed,\u201d Volker said. \u201cThat means there will also be movement toward that target. It will be an iterative process as to how we get there. But no one in Europe is contesting the notion that we need to get there.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em></em></p><p><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</strong></em></p>",

U.S. officials reported no injuries or deaths in the attack that Iran had warned was coming.</p><p>As military commanders continue to assess the total damage to Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities from the weekend attack, U.S. officials say they are still unsure of the location of Iran\u2019s near-bomb-grade uranium stockpile.</p><p>We spoke with former CIA Director General David Petraeus (Ret.) about the military mission that seems to have brought a change in behavior from Tehran and about the priority intelligence requirement for the U.S. Intelligence community. <em>Our interview has been</em> <em>lightly edited for length and clarity. </em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><div class=\"expert-block-container expert-list\">\n<div class=\"expert-item\">\n<div class=\"expert-image\">\n<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/gen-david-petraeus\">\n<img alt=\"General David Petraeus (Ret.)\" src=\"https://assets.rbl.ms/60319729/origin.jpg\" />\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"expert-description\">\n<h4 class=\"expert-name\">\n<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/gen-david-petraeus\">General David Petraeus (Ret.)</a>\n</h4>\n<p class=\"expert-about\">\n        General David Petraeus served more than 37 years in the U.S. military with six consecutive commands, five of which were combat, including command of the Multi-National Force-Iraq during the Surge, U.S. Central Command, and Coalition and U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. He is a partner in the KKR global investment firm and chairs the firm\u2019s global institute.\n      </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: The U.S. had the element of surprise in the weekend bombing raid. How important was that?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Gen. Petraeus:</em> </strong>Surprise is always a tremendous advantage if it can be achieved, and it does appear that this was the case here. There certainly was no air defense fire. Certainly, no aircraft from Iran tried to oppose those that were flying through their airspace. And they even hit two of the sites with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. 25 or so of those were used against the first two sites at Isfahan and Natanz, Natanz being the main enrichment site, of course, that was already hit by the Israelis. A very impressive operation, without question. And again, absolutely no opposition from the ground or from the air.</p><p>All of this was done in 25 minutes from entering the airspace to leaving it, having flown all the way from the middle part of the United States, seven apparently B-2 bombers, each carrying two of the massive ordnance penetrators, those 30,000 pound mountain busters, really, bunker buster doesn't quite do it justice, with 5,000 pounds of explosive after they've already burrowed through rock or concrete or what have you.</p><p>There are questions, however, after all of this, and I think we have to be very cognizant of them, the most significant is really how much damage actually was done. And you don't know until the BDA - the bomb damage assessment - process has been concluded and intelligence has determined whether or not the facilities were completely destroyed with all of the centrifuges and with all of the highly enriched uranium that was stockpiled at these different sites. Did some of it get moved in the days before? Did some of the centrifuges as well as the HEU get displaced? Is there a hidden site? There have been rumors about that, as you know, I'm sure.</p><p>And so how much of the nuclear enterprise is left at this point? And here, we would talk just not about the enriched uranium, the highly enriched uranium - the IAEA said they saw some particles that were enriched to as high as 83%, recently noting that 90%-plus is weapons grade - how many centrifuges are left? Are they operational? Could they enrich the HEU, further to weapons grade? And do they have the expertise left to do all of this, noting that I think it's approaching two dozen of the leading nuclear scientists have now been killed by Israel.</p><p>Those are some of the very significant questions that remain to be answered. But without question, this was a very impressive operation carried out by over 125 aircraft, if you count all of the refueling aircraft, you count the F-22 stealth fighters, the F-35 stealth fighter bombers and so forth that escorted them through the airspace, the submarines, the seven B-2 bombers plus jammers, air surveillance, undoubtedly drone surveillance, this was a well-orchestrated effort that shows our men and women in uniform really at their very best.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: Talk to us a little bit about how the bomb damage assessement \u2013 the BDA - works. I'm assuming when they're assessing the damage from this bombing, they're using a lot of overhead images. You served as director of the CIA. I would assume there would be some human intelligence from sources on the ground that would be woven into that. What are the components of the damage assessment? How does it work?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Gen. Petraeus:</strong></em> Every element of intelligence will be employed in this case. Of course, it will include various forms of imagery intelligence. There will be various forms of signals intelligence if they can get it, cyber intelligence; and as you noted, human intelligence. Measurement and Signals, MASINT, is another whole element; even open-source intelligence, if it can be mined and you can find something. There may be people taking photos of this and we\u2019ve seen repeatedly how useful cell phone videos can be in just seeing what took place. So, the bottom line is that every element, every type of intelligence that can be gathered, will be gathered. That\u2019s the science and then the art, of course, is in the fusion of all of this.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: You actually oversaw exercises around this very scenario while you were in Command. I'm wondering if you can talk us through some of the challenges that the U.S. military could have run into as part of this operation. How difficult is an operation like this to actually pull off?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Gen. Petraeus:</strong></em> An operation like this is difficult even without an enemy. 125 aircraft engaged in this - it's a real minuet. Everything is timed out. The fact that it flew from the middle part of the United States all the way across the ocean, across many of the Gulf states and so forth from the Mediterranean to get to Iran and then had to link-up with the F-22s and the F-35s that were presumably already in bases around the region. There are jammers, electronic warfare aircraft. There are aircraft that are performing surveillance tasks, both air surveillance and then others that undoubtedly were looking at the actual targets themselves before and after.</p><p>This was a very complicated operation even without any enemy. We did actually do a rehearsal of a plan to destroy Iran\u2019s entire nuclear program. This operation hit just three sites, of course. The rehearsal was formulated after the September 2009 release of information by the International Atomic Energy Agency that Fordow existed. This was known in intelligence circles prior to that but that was a catalyst for the development of a plan to destroy the entire program, and the means for retaliation and the air and ballistic missile defenses and all the rest of this.</p><p>That was an enormous plan, even bigger than what was carried out over the weekend. We did rehearse that one time in the continental United States. This is all publicly known. And that meant that we flew laps of the U.S. with the B-2 bombers, given how far their route would be if they took off from the U.S., as appears to be the case in this particular situation. And even then, it was very challenging.</p><p><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: </em>It's fascinating. What can you tell us in terms of what would it take to completely destroy Iran's nuclear program?<em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Gen. Petraeus:</em> </strong>A lot more than this, because there are many other sites. To be very clear about it, all you have to do is look at the various maps of what the Israelis have taken out over the past nine days or so, and you'll see what it was that we were envisioning destroying. Now, some of those are new or more developed than they were back at that time. The air ballistic missile defenses are much more capable or were much more capable until Israel destroyed them than what we faced at that time. So, obviously the situation has evolved, but it was a very substantial operation, and very likely would not have been achievable within a single sortie of aircraft, however large. And there would've been a lot of follow-up operations required to ensure that you got everything. And then also to go after what they could have used to retaliate against energy infrastructure, freedom of navigation in the Gulf, our bases and forces and so forth.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: There are fears that Iran may mine the Strait of Hormuz. Once the military operation is over, you mentioned that there are rumors that there may be a hidden site, and one would assume that the intelligence component to this goes into overdrive now. What can you tell us about what is likely happening on the intelligence side?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Gen. Petraeus:</em> </strong>I'm sure that the intelligence side has been in overdrive for weeks, if not months, as this has all been contemplated. That's their job. And of course, sharing with the Israelis and taking what they are getting, because their sources and methods and years of experience and expertise are really unmatched. But now there is a crucial task. The priority intelligence requirement is to identify whether all of the highly enriched uranium has been destroyed, whether all of the centrifuges have been destroyed, and what other human expertise is still alive that could restart a program or continue what they were doing with whatever is left at this point in time.</p><p>That is a huge, huge question. I'm not sure that at the end of the day that they'll be able to answer that with complete certainty. That has always been a challenge.</p><p><em><strong>The Cipher Brief: You mentioned these aren't really bunker buster bombs, they're mountain buster bombs. How likely do you think it would be if these bombs were successfully dropped in the right place, which it looks like they were - how would they work?</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Gen. Petraeus:</em> </strong>No other country has this 30,000lb bomb. No other country has an aircraft that can carry this size bomb. What you would typically do is launch one and try to see what the effect was, and others are going to follow. The same is true of Natanz. You have to burrow down through the subterranean chambers to get to the very bottom, which is where the so-called mission spaces were at Natanz. The Israelis did do that already, and I suspect that the combination of the submarine-launched ballistic missiles and MOPs used there will have finished that off.</p><p>With respect to Fordow, the bomb will penetrate quite a distance. There's plenty out there in publicly available information that shows how far; it depends though on the particular rock, how dense it is, or concrete or what have you. But eventually it burrows all the way down, and then it literally blows up the 5,000 pounds of explosive that are in the warhead portion of the bomb. And again, if you need to, you just pile drive your way all the way down into the center of that structure.</p><p>We'll see what it is that our various imagery intelligence and other forms of intelligence can tell us about how successful this was. There are concerns about photos online, showing trucks outside Fordow in the days leading up to this attack. It\u2019s hard to say how old they were and what was really was going on with them. But that does inject a bit of uncertainty into whether or not all of the HEU was still there, and whether all of the centrifuges were still there. That's going to be a key question for the intelligence community.</p><p><em><strong>This is exclusive Subscriber+Member content. </strong></em><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in </em><a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\"><em>The Cipher Brief</em></a></strong><em><strong> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</strong></em></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION / FINE PRINT</strong> \u2014 \u201cI want to thank and congratulate Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu. We worked as a team like perhaps no team has ever worked before, and we\u2019ve gone a long way to erasing this horrible threat to Israel. I want to thank the Israeli military for the wonderful job they\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>That was President Trump last Saturday night during his announcement of the U.S. attacks earlier that evening on three of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites.</p><p>It should remind people how important Netanyahu and the Israeli military were in Trump\u2019s off-and-on military and diplomatic decision-making during the weeks leading up to the attack.</p><p>Perhaps one key was Trump\u2019s acceptance of Netanyahu\u2019s claim that Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon, which was done publicly last Tuesday. On Air Force One heading home from the G7 meeting, Trump was asked how close he thought Iran was to getting a bomb and he replied, \u201cVery close.\u201d</p><p>At that time, the U.S. intelligence community had assessed that Iran, although increasing the level of uranium enrichment to over 60 percent \u2013 with 90 percent needed for a bomb \u2013 had not decided to build a bomb.</p><p>When Trump was told that his Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard had two months earlier testified to Congress that Iran had not yet decided to build a bomb, he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t care what she said. I think they were very close to having it.\u201d</p><p>For me that was another Helsinki moment \u2013 taking me back to the July 2018 press conference in Helsinki with Russian President Vladimir Putin, after the two leaders had met together. Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to the allegations of Moscow meddling in the U.S. 2016 elections.</p><p>Trump replied, \"President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be.\" And Trump still believes it today.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief has been talking with the foremost experts on the region since the surprise U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear facilities- including former National Intelligence Manager for Iran at ODNI and energy expert Norm Roule and former CIA Director General David Petraeus (Ret.) - about what comes next in Iran.

But, Trump warned, that failure to reach agreement within 60 days once negotiations began could result in serious military consequences for Tehran.</p><p>Those negotiations began on April 12, and after five rounds of talks, on June 9, Iran rejected the Trump administration's proposal for a new nuclear deal which prohibited Iran from domestic uranium enrichment, removed Iran\u2019s current stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, and the set conditions for lifting sanctions on Iran.</p><p>During that April-to-June two-month negotiating period, things were going on secretly. In Israel, its military and intelligence agencies were preparing complex plans for attacking Iran\u2019s top military personnel, offensive missile units, air force and air defenses and radar systems.</p><p>Joint Chief Chairman Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, during a Sunday press conference, talked about the U.S. preparation activities.</p><p>\u201cIn just a matter of weeks, this [bombing Iran nuclear sites] went from strategic planning to global execution,\u201d Caine said. He added, \u201cMore than 125 U.S. aircraft participated in this mission, including seven B2 stealth bombers, multiple flights of fourth and fifth generation fighters, dozens and dozens of air-refueling tankers a guided-missile submarine, and a full array of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft.\u201d</p><p>Another indication that U.S. planning for the Iran attack went on during the nuclear negotiations came from what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said when he appeared with Caine at Sunday\u2019s press conference.</p><p>\u201cIran found out that when POTUS [President of the United States] says 60 days that he seeks peace and negotiation, he means 60 days of peace and negotiation. Otherwise that nuclear program, that nuclear capability, will not exist,\u201d Hegseth said.</p><p>On June 13, one day after the Trump negotiation deadline, Israel attacked Iran with</p><p>fighter-bomber aircraft and armed drones that had been smuggled into Iran. They incapacitated many of its air defenses and offensive missile system and killed top generals and scientists. In a telephone interview with Reuters, Trump said, \u201cWe knew everything [about the Israeli attack], and I tried to save Iran humiliation and death. I tried to save them very hard because I would have loved to have seen a deal worked out.\u201d</p><p>Caine said on Sunday, \u201cIsrael had an incredible military success especially at the beginning and ongoing in degrading Iranian capabilities in degrading Iranian launchers...It's been incredible to watch what our ally Israel has been able to do.\u201d</p><p>He later added, with reference to the U.S. bombing in Iran, \u201cWe took advantage of some of the preparatory work [by the Israelis] that's been done over the past week and a half in terms of axis of approach\u201d to Iran targets. He added, \u201cI won't get into the particulars, but as the secretary [Hegseth] said, it was a U.S. strike. We made sure we were not in the same piece of airspace\u2026That was the extent of it.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

At the time, U.S. Air Force refueling tankers and fighter jets had been moved into position, and the military was working on providing additional protection for American forces stationed in the region.</p><p>There is talk that Trump had the option of calling off the attack at the last minute. But it\u2019s more likely that the President saw the two-week negotiation statement as his attempt to distract the Iranians from U.S. military preparations.</p><p>It\u2019s also worth noting Trump\u2019s use of Truth Social harsh messaging when he claims to be seeking negotiations. For example, on last Tuesday, June 17, Trump wrote, \u201cWe know exactly where the so-called \u2018Supreme Leader\u2019 is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there \u2014 we are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.\u201d</p><p>That is not likely to bring Iran negotiators to the table. Nor would another message Trump sent out the same day: \u201cUNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!\u201d</p><p>There was one lighter, but interesting, moment during Sunday\u2019s Hegseth/Caine press conference.</p><p>Since April, the acting Defense Department Inspector General has been reviewing Hegseth\u2019s use of Signal messaging to describe U.S. military strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen to non-military individuals.</p><p>In his opening statement, Caine said at one point, \u201cI am particularly proud of our discipline related to operational security [secrecy of plans], something that was of great concern to the President, the [Defense] Secretary, [Central Command Commander] General [Erik] Kurilla and me.

    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION --</strong> The weekend bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites in Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow surprised the leadership in Tehran. It shouldn\u2019t have, given Iran\u2019s cavalier behavior and their initial dismissive response to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) censure of Iran for \u201cnot complying with nonproliferation obligations\u201d and Tehran\u2019s response that \u2018Iran would launch a new enrichment center in a secure location and replace the first generation of machines with more modern equipment.\u201d</p><p>Israel\u2019s response was quick and deadly: bombing the three principal Iranian nuclear sites and killing leaders in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).</p><p>The speed and accuracy of the U.S. and Israeli attacks obviously surprised Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Perhaps Mr. Khamenei thought he had more time. He was wrong. Mr. Khamenei may have thought Iran\u2019s 2023 membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in 2023, and the March 2025 joint military exercise with Russia and China may have tempered Israel\u2019s reaction to Iran\u2019s flaunting of Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty obligations. Or perhaps they thought the January 2025 Iran-Russia Strategic Cooperation Agreement would have provided some cover. Or that Iran\u2019s close relationship with China, certainly since the 2021 China-Iran twenty-five-year strategic agreement on energy and geopolitical issues, would have helped them. But this didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>What Iran got were mere statements of support. </p><p>Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, is now in Moscow meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to plead for Russia\u2019s support. Mr. Putin has already said that \u201cThere was no justification for the U.S. bombing of Iran and that Moscow was trying to help the Iranian people.\u201d China\u2019s response to the U.S. bombing was equally predictable, \u201cChina strongly condemns the U.S. attacks on Iran and bombing their nuclear facilities \u2026 calling for an immediate cease fire.\u201d</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Their relationship with Iran goes back decades, and much of it dealt with providing Iran with ballistic missiles and conventional weaponry for its war with Iraq.

    "title": "Could Iran's Judiciary Chief Be the Next Supreme Leader?",
    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/iran-supreme-leader-succession",
    "description": "<p><strong>OPINION \u2014 </strong>As Israel's unprecedented military campaign and targeting of Iranian military leaders and scientists wreaked havoc across Iran last week, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei retreated to a bunker and initiated deliberations over his successor. With the 2024 death of a former leading contender, President Ebrahim Raisi, and Khamenei\u2019s recent sidelining of his son, Mojtaba, the powerful head of Iran\u2019s judiciary and former intelligence minister, Gholam-Hoseyn Mohseni-Ejei, is likely a serious candidate for the role of the Islamic Republic\u2019s next Supreme Leader.<br /></p><p>Mohseni-Ejei possesses formidable credentials for ensuring the survival of the Islamic Revolution, the regime\u2019s highest strategic goal. A longtime insider, his career bridges the two most critical organs of internal regime preservation: the judiciary and the Ministry of Intelligence. He had deep-rooted ties to Raisi, his predecessor as judiciary head, and to the current intelligence minister, Esmail Khatib. These relations reflect decades of institutional collaboration, trust building, and ideological alignment. All three men cut their teeth in the judiciary and intelligence bureaucracy, sharing not only a hardline outlook but close connections with Khamenei. With Raisi gone and the regime under siege, Khamenei may view Mohseni-Ejei as the most experienced and dependable successor to steer the Islamic Republic through a moment of existential peril. If so, he almost certainly will make this known to the Assembly of Experts, the body of clerics that chooses the Supreme Leader.</p><p>Mohseni-Ejei\u2019s ascent is not based merely on his personal ties. It also reflects the growing centrality of the intelligence-security-judiciary triad in safeguarding the regime\u2019s continuity. More recently, as the Israel-Iran war has intensified, Iranian leaders have shifted their focus further inward\u2014 ramping up internal surveillance, searching for traitors, and shutting down communications with the outside world. In this context, his control over the judiciary and having a friend head the Ministry of Intelligence potentially provide Mohseni-Ejei unrivaled leverage over the members of the Assembly of Experts and other powerful figures among Iran\u2019s political factions.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em></em><strong><em>The Cipher Brief has been talking with the foremost experts on the region since the surprise U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear facilities- including former National Intelligence Manager for Iran at ODNI and energy expert Norm Roule and former CIA Director General David Petraeus (Ret.) - about what comes next in Iran.  Watch the interviews exclusively on The Cipher Brief's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@thecipherbrief\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Channel </a>and subscribe to make sure you stay up to date on how the experts see events unfolding.</em></strong></p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p>Under Mohseni-Ejei\u2019s leadership, the judiciary embraced expansive interpretations of national security law to suppress political unrest, ethnic dissent, and defiance of intrusive morality laws. Khatib\u2019s MOIS has worked in tandem, deploying aggressive surveillance and conducting wide-scale arrests to suppress dissent. To relieve some pressure from a public angry about Iran\u2019s failing economy and petty repressive measures such as mandatory hijab, the judiciary has reduced enforcement of some restrictions over the past year. Nonetheless, the collaboration between Mohseni-Ejei and Khatib since 2021 represents one of the most coordinated periods of state repression during the regime\u2019s four-plus decades of existence.</p><p>Crucially, Khamenei\u2019s recent decision to provide the Assembly of Experts with three preferred names\u2014an unprecedented move in the Islamic Republic\u2019s history\u2014suggests a pragmatic urgency favoring survival over process. If Khamenei values institutional loyalty, ideological orthodoxy, and the machinery of domestic control, Mohseni-Ejei may be the logical choice. His past leadership of the MOIS and current control of the judiciary give him operational experience in both managing crises and protecting the Islamic revolution. Moreover, his long-standing ties to Khamenei himself\u2014dating back to his early years monitoring potential \u201cdeviation\u201d within the intelligence services\u2014suggest trust built over decades of mutual survival.</p><p>Critics may cite Mohseni-Ejei\u2019s role in past abuses, including the post-2009 Green Movement crackdown and his promotion of a crackdown on dress code infractions that led to the Mahsa Amini protests of 2022. However, within the current regime such episodes are not stains but qualifications. With the United States now directly involved in the war, Iran\u2019s leadership may gravitate toward a man whose entire career has been defined by countering sedition, exposing conspiracies, and upholding ideological discipline through the courts and the intelligence apparatus.</p><p>In Iran\u2019s increasingly closed and militarized political sphere, the path to supreme authority may not lie in clerical scholarship or charisma, but in institutional command and operational loyalty. Mohseni-Ejei, a consummate enforcer, may well be the last man standing when the Assembly of Experts makes its fateful choice.</p><p><em><strong>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\" target=\"_self\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone\u2019s Business.</strong></em></p><em></em><em></em><em><strong><br /></strong></em>",

    "description": "<p>Steps you can take to report the theft and check if it\u2019s being resold \u2013 as well as how to protect your next one</p><p>Whether you use your bike to commute daily, for a quick trips to the shops or long rides to keep fit, having it stolen can be a nightmare. Here\u2019s what to do if yours goes missing.</p><p>Report the theft to the police and describe the bike in as much detail as possible, giving the model, make and where it was stolen. You should also include a description of any scratches, dents and marks that could help identify it, and a picture if you have one. You can go into your local police station or call 101 in the UK to file a report. Make sure you get a crime reference number.</p><p>Home insurance policies will often cover your bike when it\u2019s at home but you will probably have needed to pay extra to extend this for when you\u2019re out and about, or if you have a valuable bike. Report the loss to your insurer and give it the crime reference number. Your bike will not be covered if you failed to look after it, such as not locking it securely or with a suitable lock.</p><p>Declare your bike stolen on <a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a>, a UK bike database \u2013 you can do this even if you have not registered your bike on there before. It will help improve the chances of your bike being recovered if there are pictures and descriptions of the bike, and where it was stolen.</p><p>Post on bike and cycling forums, such as <a href=\"https://forum.cyclinguk.org/\">Cycling UK Forum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeforums.net/]\">Bike Forum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclechat.net/\">CycleChat</a> in case people come across it when looking to buy a new bike.</p><p>Look on resale sites such as Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace and eBay to see whether someone is trying to sell your bike. You can set up alerts for bikes that are the same make and model. If you find one that looks like yours, alert the police \u2013 they may be able to recover it. It is not advisable to set up a sting or try to deal with the case yourself.</p><p>Alert the local community on neighbourhood forums such as Nextdoor or local Facebook groups and get in touch any bike shops nearby in case someone comes in to the shop and tries to sell one that matches your description.</p><p>Scuff the frame up a bit using sandpaper, paint and stickers so it is less appealing to thieves. Some kitsch, drawn-on hearts might save you a lot of hassle in the future.</p><p>Register it on <a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a> and upload pictures alongside the frame number, which is usually found on the bottom bracket shell between the pedals or on the rear dropouts where the back wheel slots in. This will help the police trace it back to you if it is stolen and recovered.</p><p>Invest in two high-quality locks to make your bike less of a target. At least one of these should be a good-quality D-lock. Be sure to attach the frame to the stand when locking up.</p><p>Take any removable parts with you whenever you leave it.</p><p>Find and apply for your nearest cycle parking. This gives another layer of protection, but be sure to still lock up securely. In cities there are also many cycle hangars, such as Cyclehoop, which are small bike stores on residential streets you can apply for at a small cost each year. <a href=\"https://www.cyclehoop.rentals/\">Check whether there\u2019s one near you</a>.</p><p>Conceal a Bluetooth tracker on your bike to help locate it if it goes missing. The smaller and more discreet the tracker, the better. Good spots to hide them include under the seat or inside the handlebar. Apple AirTag and Tile Sticker are popular among bike owners.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jun/11/what-to-do-if-your-bike-is-stolen-and-how-to-break-the-cycle\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "description": "<p><strong>4 March 1895</strong>: The popularity of cycling among the aristocracy is remarkable as the bicycle used to be looked upon as the poor man\u2019s horse</p><p>The increasing popularity of cycling among the \u2018aristocracy\u2019 is remarkable. Among recent recruits may be mentioned Lord Zetland, Lady Havelock Allan, Sir Joseph Pease, the Earl of Camperdown, the Duke of Westminster, and two of the daughters of the late Earl of Iddesleigh. Heretofore the only objection urged against the pastime has been its vulgarity. The bicycle was looked upon as the poor man\u2019s horse, and those who patronised it were considered very ordinary people. The utility of the bicycle as a means of conveyance, its capacity for causing harmless and elevating pleasure, and its undoubted health-giving qualities were all ignored at the dictates of the fashionable world. The said fashionable world have suddenly discovered the virtues of the cycle, and, ignoring the fact that even butchers\u2019 boys may derive pleasure from the same source, they have taken to it in numbers. The middle class, a large proportion of whom are born snobs, will, now that the only objection is removed, join the ranks in thousand. It will have an effect also even on those who are not snobs.</p><p>Heretofore many professional and business men have been afraid to appear in public on wheels simply because it would damage them from a business point of view. I have known leading doctors who have made a practice of rising in summer at 5am, to enjoy a long ride before breakfast simply because they dared not appear in public except in the irreproachable brougham. For such as these the bar is being removed.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/04/cycling-notes-snobbery-female-riders-and-dispensing-with-a-brake-1895\">Continue reading...</a>",

With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing</span><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1. What is affiliate marketing?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is an affiliate program?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.&nbsp; Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers.

What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;5.

Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads.

What is a cookie?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Cookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents.

If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.</span><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Imagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don\u2019t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That\u2019s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It\u2019s like your computer\u2019s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called \u201cBit Gold.\u201d However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">So, What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:</b></span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain collects information in \u201cblocks\u201d.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blocks form chains, which are called \u201cBlockchains.\u201d</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>Let\u2019s get to know more about the blockchain.</b></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How does blockchain work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Here\u2019s how it works:</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Someone or a computer will transacts</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The transaction is transmitted throughout the network.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A network of computers can confirm the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a block</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The blocks are linked together to create a history.</span></li></ul><p></p>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">And that\u2019s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it\u2019s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.</span></li></ul><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How are Blockchains used?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been\u2014so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is Blockchain Decentralization?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology is safe, even if it\u2019s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called \u201cDecentralization,\u201d meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain guarantees your data's authenticity\u2014not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros and Cons of Blockchain</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Accuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Safe, private, and easy transactions</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Provides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal information</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Cons</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Data storage has limits.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It has a risk of being used for illicit activities&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Frequently Asked Questions About Blockchain</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">I\u2019ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is Blockchain a cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the most prominent blockchain company?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Who owns Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It\u2019s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency&nbsp;</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

if you are a non-fiction writer</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Go for ProWritingAid if you are a fiction writer.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">ProWritingAid is better at catching errors found in long-form content. However, Grammarly is more suited to short blog posts and other similar tasks.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">ProWritingAid helps you clean up your writing by checking for style, structure, and content while Grammarly focuses on grammar and punctuation.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Grammarly has a more friendly UI/UX whereas; ProWritingAid offers complete feedback on big picture writing.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Both ProWritingAid and Grammarly are awesome writing tools, without a doubt. but as per my experience, Grammarly is a winner here because Grammarly helps you to review and edit your content. Grammarly highlights all the mistakes in your writing within seconds of copying and pasting the content into Grammarly\u2019s editor or using the software\u2019s native feature in other text editors.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Not only does it identify tiny grammatical and spelling errors, it tells you when you overlook punctuations where they are needed. And, beyond its plagiarism-checking capabilities, Grammarly helps you proofread your content. Even better, the software offers a free plan that gives you access to some of its features.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>",

People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1) What is an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFT stands for non-fungible&nbsp; token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2) What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information\u2014such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts\u2014in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can\u2019t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3) What makes an NFT valuable?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br />\n</span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn\u2019t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4) How do NFTs work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can\u2019t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFTs also contain smart contracts\u2014small computer programs that run on the blockchain\u2014that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5) What\u2019s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you\u2019ll be able to upload and sell your creations</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain\u2014the bitcoin ledger of transactions\u2014and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10) How do we buy an NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">11) Can i mint NFT for free?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it?</span></h3>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Why are people investing so much in NFT?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><span>&nbsp;Non-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don\u2019t own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet.</span><br /></span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">That\u2019s a wrap. Hope you guys found this article enlightening. I just answer some question with my limited knowledge about NFTs. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to drop them in the comment section below.

Why is email marketing important?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email is the marketing tool that helps you&nbsp; create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak&nbsp; to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them.

What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Again, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be&nbsp; times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your&nbsp; data to decide.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;4. Which metrics should I be looking at?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The two most important metrics for email marketing are&nbsp; open rate and click-through rate.

How do I write a decent subject line?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing&nbsp; the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for&nbsp; A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and&nbsp; simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,&nbsp; then repeated&nbsp; at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example \"Click here to download the premium theme for free.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><br />\n\n<br />6. Is email marketing still effective?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site&nbsp; hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans&nbsp; see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely&nbsp; see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span><br /></span><br />\n\n<br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Buying an email list is&nbsp; waste of time &amp; money.

How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">If the&nbsp; subject line of the email is irrelevant to&nbsp; customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus&nbsp; on sales, offers and discounts.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Submit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers.

It is usually personalized and includes a business perspective. However, it is still an unsolicited email.

The most important thing to prevent this from happening is to respect your recipients' choice to opt-out of receiving emails from you. You can add the links to easily unsubscribe.
