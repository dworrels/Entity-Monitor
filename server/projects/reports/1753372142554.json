The violence erupted along their contested border, where a temple, Prasat Ta Muen Thom, is claimed by both countries. The conflict has a long history, dating back to a 1907 map created during French colonial rule in Cambodia, which has led to conflicting interpretations and decades of tensions between the two countries.\n\nThe current crisis began in late May with the death of a Cambodian soldier in a border skirmish and escalated on July 23, when a Thai soldier lost his leg in a land mine explosion, prompting Thailand to send F-16 fighter jets to strike targets in Cambodia and order the evacuation of border areas. Both nations have accused each other of firing first, with Thailand's prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, condemning what she called Cambodian aggression, and Cambodia's prime minister, Hun Manet, stating that his nation had \"no choice but to respond with armed force against this armed invasion.\"\n\nThe conflict is also unfolding against a backdrop of domestic crisis in Thailand, where Paetongtarn's suspension from office was prompted by a leaked recording of a private phone call with Cambodia's former prime minister, Hun Sen, in which she made disparaging remarks about the Thai military. China has expressed concern over the clashes and is seeking to facilitate talks between the two sides, with its foreign minister criticizing US tariffs as an attempt to undermine the countries' development and China's influence in the region. The border region, which is a stronghold of the Shinawatra dynasty and has cultural and historical ties to both countries, has been a focal point of the tensions, with civilians killed in four Thai border provinces.\n",
      "Source: NYT World News\nTitle: China could be a player in efforts to calm Cambodia-Thailand tensions.\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 15:03:22 +0000\nSummary:\nThe ongoing border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia has escalated into deadly clashes, resulting in at least 12 fatalities and injuring dozens. The tensions began in late May and worsened on July 23, when a Thai soldier lost his leg in a landmine explosion, prompting Thailand to downgrade diplomatic relations with Cambodia. The disputed territory, which includes the Prasat Ta Muen Thom temple, has been a point of contention for years, with both nations accusing each other of firing first.\n\nThe crisis has its roots in a 1907 map created by colonial officials, which has led to decades of disputes and failed attempts at resolution. The border region has a shared cultural heritage, with the province of Surin in northeastern Thailand being an important agricultural center and home to ruins from the Khmer Empire.\n\nChina, which is the largest trading partner of both Thailand and Cambodia, has emerged as a potential diplomatic player in efforts to calm the tensions. China has increased its economic and political influence in the region, investing heavily in infrastructure projects in both countries. Chinese officials have expressed concern over the clashes, promising to play a \"constructive role\" in negotiations between the two countries.\n\nThe situation has been complicated by Thailand's domestic crisis, with Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra being suspended from office amid the crisis and facing calls for resignation. The clashes have raised concerns about a potential coup given Thailand's turbulent history of military takeovers.\n\nIn this context, China's involvement could provide a diplomatic opening to exert its influence and calm the tensions between Thailand and Cambodia. China has recently strengthened ties with Cambodia, and its leader, Xi Jinping, has invested heavily in infrastructure projects in both countries. As a neutral player, China may be able to facilitate talks between the two sides and help resolve the longstanding border dispute.\n",

The clashes center around a disputed temple, Prasat Ta Muen Thom, which is claimed by both countries and has been the source of a longstanding territorial dispute dating back to a 1907 map created by colonial officials. The violence began after a months-long standoff and has prompted evacuations of residents, with Thai authorities accusing Cambodia of firing rockets into civilian areas and Cambodia accusing Thailand of aggression.\n\nThe border clashes are occurring alongside a domestic crisis in Thailand, where Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has been suspended from office amid a political crisis sparked by a leaked private phone call with Cambodian leader Hun Sen. In the call, Paetongtarn appeared to show deference to Hun Sen and made disparaging remarks about the Thai military, leading to calls for her resignation, street protests, and a petition to the constitutional court.\n\nThe crisis presents a potential diplomatic opening for China, which has increased its economic and political influence in both countries and has expressed concern over the skirmishes. China has offered to play a \"constructive role\" in negotiations, and its leader, Xi Jinping, has recently strengthened ties with Cambodia. Thailand has also been expanding its cooperation with China, which has strained relations with the US. The situation remains volatile, with tensions likely to continue as Thailand and Cambodia engage in diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict.\n",
      "Source: CBS - World\nTitle: Thai jets strike inside Cambodia as deadly border clash escalates\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 09:40:42 -0400\nSummary:\n**Summary of the Article**\n\nThe article reports on a significant escalation of clashes between Thai and Cambodian soldiers along their shared 500-mile border. The conflict began on Thursday, with fighting reported in at least six areas along the border, resulting in the deaths of at least 12 people in Thailand, including 10 civilians and one soldier, and injuring 28 others.\n\n**Background and Trigger for Clashes**\n\nThe trigger for the clashes was a mine explosion along the border on Wednesday that wounded five Thai soldiers. Thailand attributed the mine to Cambodia, alleging that it was a newly laid Russian-made mine, while Cambodia denied this and pointed out that many unexploded mines and other ordnance are a legacy of 20th-century wars and unrest.\n\n**Clashes and Airstrikes**\n\nThe first clash on Thursday occurred in the morning near the ancient Ta Muen Thom temple along the border of Thailand's Surin province and Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey province. Thai soldiers reported seeing a drone and then six armed Cambodian soldiers moving closer to their positions, leading to an exchange of fire. Cambodia's Defense Ministry, however, claimed that Thailand deployed a drone first and opened fire, and that Cambodia acted in self-defense.\n\nThe Thai army later launched airstrikes on military targets in Cambodia, while Cambodia accused Thailand of bombing a road near the ancient Preah Vihear temple. Thailand's Foreign Ministry also accused Cambodia of attacking both military and non-military sites in Thailand, including a hospital.\n\n**Evacuations and Diplomatic Fallout**\n\nThe clashes led to the evacuation of communities near the frontier, with Thai villagers fleeing their homes to seek shelter. Thailand's foreign ministry announced that all land border crossings with Cambodia were sealed and urged all Thai nationals to leave Cambodia. The U.S. Embassy in Thailand also issued a warning, advising U.S. citizens to follow direction from Thai security services and consult local government authorities.\n\nThe clashes have also had significant diplomatic fallout. Thailand withdrew its ambassador to Cambodia and expelled the Cambodian ambassador on Wednesday, following the mine blast. Cambodia downgraded diplomatic relations, recalling all Cambodian staff from its embassy in Bangkok. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet wrote to the current president of the U.N. Security Council, asking for an urgent meeting to address what he termed \"Thailand's aggression.\"\n\n**Casualties and Investigation**\n\nThe Thai government reported 11 deaths, including 10 civilians and one soldier, and 28 injuries, including four soldiers. Cambodia has not released any information on casualties on its side. The border dispute has also had political fallout in Thailand, with Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra facing criticism for her handling of a previous border dispute in May that resulted in the death of a Cambodian soldier.\n\n**Current Situation and Future Developments**\n\nThe situation along the border remains volatile, with ongoing clashes and a significant military presence on both sides. The international community is closely watching the situation, with the U.S. Embassy in Thailand issuing a warning to U.S. citizens in the area. The U.N. Security Council may hold an urgent meeting to address the crisis, and diplomatic efforts are underway to de-escalate the situation and prevent further violence.\n",

The clash resulted in casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure, and has escalated tensions between the two nations.\n\n**What Happened on Thursday?**\n\nAccording to Thailand's National Security Council (NSC), the incident began at 7:30am local time when Cambodian forces allegedly deployed drones to monitor Thai troop positions near the border. Thai officials claim that Cambodian soldiers armed with rocket-propelled grenades assembled in the area, and despite attempts to negotiate, Cambodian forces opened fire at 8:20am, prompting a Thai counterattack. Thailand deployed F-16s to strike Cambodian targets and ordered evacuations in Surin Province.\n\n**Conflicting Accounts**\n\nCambodia, however, tells a different story. Officials in Phnom Penh claim that the clash began at 6:30am when Thai soldiers allegedly violated a prior agreement by advancing near Prasat Ta Muen Thom, an ancient Khmer-Hindu temple near the border, and placing barbed wire around its base. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said that the country had \"no choice but to respond with armed force against this armed invasion,\" accusing Thai troops of opening fire first at the temple.\n\n**Casualties and Damage**\n\nThai authorities reported 12 deaths, including 11 civilians and one soldier, and at least 31 injuries, including a child. Thousands have begun fleeing the conflict zone. Cambodia has not confirmed casualty numbers. The NSC accused Cambodia of using heavy weapons, including BM-21 rocket launchers and artillery, which damaged civilian infrastructure in four Thai provinces.\n\n**Background to the Conflict**\n\nThe dispute between Thailand and Cambodia is a longstanding one, dating back over a century to when the borders between the two nations were first drawn during the French colonial occupation of Cambodia. The current wave of tension began in May, following the death of a Cambodian soldier in a border skirmish. A land mine injury to a Thai soldier on Wednesday further inflamed tensions.\n\n**Escalation and Diplomatic Fallout**\n\nThailand has downgraded diplomatic relations with Cambodia, expelling Cambodia's ambassador and recalling its own. Cambodia has banned Thai imports, including fruits, vegetables, electricity, and internet services. Both sides have deployed additional troops to the contested border areas.\n\n**Thailand's Political Crisis**\n\nThe conflict has also exposed Thailand's internal politics, with Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra facing public outrage over a phone call with Cambodian leader Hun Sen, in which she appeared to disparage Thailand's military and take a deferential tone. The call sparked protests in Bangkok, and Paetongtarn has come under mounting pressure to resign.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* A deadly exchange of fire occurred along the disputed border between Thailand and Cambodia on Thursday.\n* Both countries have provided conflicting accounts of the incident.\n* The clash resulted in casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure.\n* The conflict has escalated tensions between the two nations, with both sides deploying additional troops to the contested border areas.\n* Thailand has downgraded diplomatic relations with Cambodia, and Cambodia has banned Thai imports.\n* The conflict has exposed Thailand's internal politics, with Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra facing public outrage over a phone call with Cambodian leader Hun Sen.\n",

The situation has brought relations between the two Southeast Asian countries to their lowest point in decades.\n\n**The Clashes**\n\nOn Thursday, July 24, 2025, exchanges of fire occurred between Thai and Cambodian forces along the border. Each side accuses the other of initiating the violence. Thailand's Prime Minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, stated that Cambodian forces fired into Thai territory first. In response, Thai authorities claim to have deployed F-16 fighter jets to strike targets in Cambodia. The Thai army reported that Cambodia had fired rockets into civilian areas in four Thai provinces. Meanwhile, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet stated that Thai soldiers opened fire on Cambodian troops first, and Cambodian forces responded with armed force about 15 minutes later.\n\n**Casualties and Evacuations**\n\nThai officials reported that 11 civilians and one soldier were killed in the clashes, and at least 31 people were injured, including a 5-year-old boy. Thousands of residents have begun evacuating from the area. However, Cambodian officials did not immediately confirm reports of casualties.\n\n**Context and Background**\n\nTensions between Thailand and Cambodia have been rising for months. A skirmish between Thai and Cambodian troops along the border in late May resulted in the death of a Cambodian soldier. On Wednesday, July 23, a Thai soldier lost his leg when a land mine exploded near the border. In response, Thailand announced that it would downgrade diplomatic relations with Cambodia, recalling its ambassador and expelling Cambodia's ambassador.\n\n**The Border Dispute**\n\nThe border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia dates back to a 1907 map created during French colonial rule in Cambodia. The two countries interpret the map differently, leading to longstanding tensions and occasional military clashes.\n\n**The Impact on Thai Politics**\n\nThe border tensions have contributed to a brewing political crisis in Thailand. In June, Prime Minister Paetongtarn called Cambodian leader Hun Sen to discuss the escalating border tensions. However, a recording of their call, in which Paetongtarn seemed to take a deferential tone and referred to Hun Sen as \"uncle,\" sparked outrage among Thai protesters. Thousands took to the streets of Bangkok to express their discontent, and Paetongtarn faced pressure to resign. Although she apologized, she was suspended by a Thai court in early July.\n\n**Current Situation**\n\nThe situation remains volatile, with both sides accusing each other of aggression. The clashes have resulted in significant human suffering, and the border area remains unstable. The international community is likely to be concerned about the escalation of violence and the potential for further conflict between the two countries.\n",

The latest flare-up began in May with military border clashes that left one Cambodian soldier dead. Since then, the two sides have taken retaliatory measures, including Thailand restricting border crossings and Cambodia halting certain imports.\n\n**Recent Escalation**\n\nOn Wednesday, five members of a Thai military patrol were wounded by a landmine blast in the Nam Yuen district of northeastern Ubon Ratchathani province. The next day, Cambodia fired rockets and artillery into Thailand, killing at least 11 civilians, according to the Thai ministry of public health. In response, Thai F-16s carried out strikes on two Cambodian military targets.\n\n**Clashes and Casualties**\n\nThe conflict intensified near two temples on the border between the Thai province of Surin and Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey, with both sides trading blame. A Cambodian shell hit a Thai house, killing one civilian and wounding three, including a five-year-old. Thailand accused Cambodia of targeting homes and civilian infrastructure, describing its actions as \"inhumane, brutal and war-hungry.\"\n\n**Diplomatic Efforts**\n\nThe violence came hours after Thailand expelled the Cambodian ambassador and recalled its own envoy in protest. Thailand's embassy in Phnom Penh urged its nationals to leave Cambodia \"as soon as possible\" unless they had urgent reasons to remain. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet requested the UN Security Council convene an \"urgent meeting\" to address what his foreign ministry called \"unprovoked military aggression.\" China, a close ally of Cambodia, expressed deep concern about the clashes and called for dialogue.\n\n**Domestic Implications**\n\nThe border dispute has triggered a domestic political crisis in Thailand, where Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was suspended from office pending an ethics probe over her conduct. Paetongtarn held a diplomatic call with Hun Sen, Cambodia's former longtime ruler and father of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, in an attempt to defuse the row. The phone call was leaked from the Cambodian side last month, sparking a judicial investigation.\n\n**Future Developments**\n\nHun Manet announced that Cambodia would start conscripting civilians next year, activating a long-dormant mandatory draft law, citing rising tensions with Thailand as the reason. The conscription law dates back to 2006 but has never been enforced. Hun Manet proposed that conscripts serve for two years to bolster the country's 200,000 personnel, requiring citizens aged 18 to 30 to enlist in the military.\n\n**International Reactions**\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, whose country currently chairs the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), called on Thailand and Cambodia to \"stand down\" and resolve their differences peacefully. The international community is watching the situation closely, with concerns about the potential for further escalation and the impact on regional stability.\n",

The violence stems from a long-standing territorial dispute between the two nations over a contested border area.\n\n**Causes of the Clashes**\n\nThe dispute centers on the Ta Muen Thom temple, a centuries-old Khmer Hindu site located in a border area claimed by both countries. The root of the issue lies in colonial-era French maps that left parts of the border ill-defined. Both Thailand and Cambodia have accused each other of opening fire first, sparking the clashes.\n\n**Escalation of Violence**\n\nThe clashes mark the deadliest escalation in the long-running territorial standoff in recent years. The violence began near the Ta Muen Thom temple, with troops from both sides exchanging fire. The situation rapidly deteriorated, leading to a significant increase in tensions between the two nations.\n\n**Diplomatic Fallout**\n\nThe clashes are not an isolated incident. The day before the violence erupted, Thailand took several diplomatic measures in response to a landmine blast that wounded five Thai soldiers. Thailand:\n\n1. Closed its northeast border crossing with Cambodia.\n2. Withdrew its ambassador from Cambodia.\n3. Expelled the Cambodian envoy.\n\nIn retaliation, Cambodia announced that it would:\n\n1. Downgrade diplomatic relations with Thailand to their lowest level.\n2. Expel the Thai ambassador.\n3.

The Thai government has expressed its preparedness to intensify its military efforts to counter these \"violations\" if Cambodia fails to comply.\n\n**Context of the Conflict**: The article does not provide extensive background information on the conflict; however, it is clear that there have been recent escalations in violence along the Thai-Cambodian border.

By warning Cambodia that it is prepared to \"intensify\" its military efforts, Thailand is signaling that it will not tolerate continued attacks on its territory or citizens.\n\n**Potential Implications**: The situation has the potential to escalate into a more significant conflict between the two countries. If Cambodia does not heed Thailand's warning and the violence continues, Thailand may take more aggressive military action. This could lead to a deterioration in relations between the two nations and potentially draw in other regional actors.\n\n**Current Situation**: The article reports that the cross-border attacks began on Thursday, resulting in an unspecified number of casualties.

At least 12 Thai nationals, mostly civilians, have been killed, and the number of casualties on the Cambodian side is unknown.\n\n**Background to the Conflict**\n\nThe dispute between Thailand and Cambodia dates back over a century, when the borders of the two nations were drawn after the French occupation of Cambodia. The argument gained momentum in 2008, when Cambodia attempted to register an 11th-century temple located in the disputed area as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which Thailand strongly opposed. Since then, there have been sporadic clashes, resulting in the deaths of soldiers and civilians on both sides.\n\n**Recent Escalation**\n\nTensions increased in May after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash, plunging bilateral ties to their lowest point in over a decade. In the past two months, both countries have imposed border restrictions on each other, including a ban on imports and a strengthening of troop presence along the border.\n\n**Events Leading to the Conflict**\n\nOn Thursday, July 24, 2025, both Thailand and Cambodia provided differing accounts of what happened. Thailand's National Security Council (NSC) claimed that Cambodia's military deployed drones to conduct surveillance of Thai troops near the border, followed by Cambodian military personnel gathering near the border with rocket-propelled grenades. Thai soldiers attempted to negotiate, but Cambodian soldiers opened fire, forcing the Thai side to retaliate.\n\nIn contrast, Cambodia claimed that Thai soldiers initiated the conflict by advancing on a Khmer-Hindu temple near the border and placing barbed wire around its base. Thai soldiers then deployed a drone and fired shots into the air, and later pre-emptively opened fire on Cambodian troops.\n\n**Current Situation and Future Prospects**\n\nThe conflict has resulted in significant damage to homes and public facilities, including a hospital and a petrol station, on the Thai side of the border. Thailand has accused Cambodia of deploying heavy weapons, while Cambodia has accused Thailand of using excessive force and carrying out air strikes on Cambodian territory.\n\nThailand's acting premier, Phumtham Wechayachai, has stated that the dispute must be addressed with care and in line with international law. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet has expressed a desire to resolve the dispute peacefully but has also stated that his country has no choice but to respond with armed force against armed aggression.\n\n**Analysis and Outlook**\n\nThe article notes that while there have been serious exchanges of fire in the past, they have de-escalated relatively quickly. However, the current situation is complicated by a lack of leadership with the strength and confidence to pull back from the confrontation in both countries. The article's correspondent, Jonathan Head, believes that the conflict will likely de-escalate, but the situation remains uncertain.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* The conflict between Thailand and Cambodia has a long history dating back over a century.\n* The dispute gained momentum in 2008 over a UNESCO World Heritage Site listing for an 11th-century temple.\n* Tensions increased in May after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash.\n* Both countries have imposed border restrictions and strengthened troop presence along the border.\n* The conflict on Thursday resulted in at least 12 Thai nationals killed and unknown casualties on the Cambodian side.\n* Both sides have provided differing accounts of what happened.\n* The situation remains uncertain, but it is hoped that the conflict will de-escalate quickly.\n",
      "Source: BBC - World News\nTitle: Twelve killed in Thailand-Cambodia military clashes on disputed border\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 10:58:24 GMT\nSummary:\n**Summary of Article: Twelve Killed in Thailand-Cambodia Military Clashes on Disputed Border**\n\nClashes between Thai and Cambodian troops on their disputed border have resulted in at least 12 deaths, with most of the casualties being civilians from three Thai provinces. The fighting, which began early on Thursday, has led to an escalation of a long-standing dispute between the two Southeast Asian neighbors that dates back over a century.\n\n**Background of the Dispute**\n\nThe border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia has its roots in the French occupation of Cambodia over a hundred years ago. The current tensions began to rise in 2008 when Cambodia attempted to register an 11th-century temple located in the disputed area as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a move that was met with strong opposition from Thailand. Since then, there have been sporadic clashes, resulting in the deaths of soldiers and civilians on both sides.\n\n**Causes of the Latest Clashes**\n\nAccording to Thailand, the latest clashes began when Cambodia's military deployed drones to conduct surveillance of Thai troops near the border. Cambodia, on the other hand, claims that Thai soldiers initiated the conflict by advancing on a Khmer-Hindu temple near the border, violating a prior agreement. The temple, known as Preah Vihear, has been a point of contention between the two countries for years.\n\n**Casualties and Evacuations**\n\nThe clashes have resulted in the deaths of 12 people, including 11 civilians and one military personnel, in the Thai provinces of Surin, Ubon Ratchathani, and Srisaket. The victims include an eight-year-old and a 15-year-old. Several people have also been wounded. Thailand has evacuated 40,000 civilians from the area to safer locations. Cambodia has yet to confirm whether it has suffered any casualties.\n\n**Government Responses**\n\nThe Thai government has closed its border with Cambodia, while Cambodia has downgraded its ties with Thailand, accusing its military of using \"excessive force\". Both countries have asked their citizens near the border to leave the areas. Thai authorities have reported that the situation is \"serious\" and that they are in the process of evacuating civilians.\n\n**Current Situation and Future Prospects**\n\nThe current situation is tense, with both countries having strengthened their troop presence along the border in recent weeks. Thailand's acting premier, Phumtham Wechayachai, has stated that the dispute with Cambodia remains \"delicate\" and must be addressed with care and in line with international law. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet has expressed a desire to resolve the dispute peacefully but has also stated that his country has \"no choice\" but to \"respond with armed force against armed aggression\".\n\n**Leadership and Prospects for Resolution**\n\nThe lack of strong leadership on both sides is seen as a major obstacle to resolving the conflict. Hun Manet, the son of former strongman Hun Sen, is still establishing his authority, while in Thailand, there is a shaky coalition government backed by another former strongman, Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin had believed he had a close personal relationship with Hun Sen and his family, but feels betrayed by Hun Sen's decision to leak a private conversation, which led to his daughter being suspended as prime minister.\n\n**Economic Impact**\n\nThe conflict has already had an economic impact, with Cambodia banning imports from Thailand, such as fruits and vegetables, and stopping imports of power and internet services. Both countries have also imposed border restrictions on each other.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the clashes between Thai and Cambodian troops on their disputed border have resulted in significant human losses and have escalated a long-standing dispute between the two countries. The situation remains tense, with both countries having strengthened their troop presence along the border. A peaceful resolution to the conflict will require strong leadership and a commitment to dialogue and cooperation. The international community is likely to be watching closely, as the conflict has the potential to destabilize the region.\n",

      "Source: NYT World News\nTitle: A Timeline of the Latest Conflict Between Cambodia and Thailand\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 10:09:35 +0000\nSummary:\nThe article provides a detailed timeline of the ongoing conflict between Cambodia and Thailand, two Southeast Asian neighboring countries. The conflict has its roots in a long-standing border dispute that dates back to the French colonial era.\n\n**Historical Background**\n\nThe border dispute between Cambodia and Thailand began in 1907, when a map created during French colonial rule in Cambodia was used as the basis for Cambodia's claims to certain parts of the border. However, the map's vagueness led to conflicting interpretations, and Thailand contested it. Despite attempts to resolve the dispute diplomatically, the issue was never fully settled, even after the International Court of Justice intervened in 1962.\n\n**Recent Conflicts**\n\nThe conflict escalated in 2008, with intermittent military fighting breaking out between the two countries. The last major clash occurred in 2011, when fighting focused on a jungle border area, including ancient temples claimed by both sides. The seven-day conflict resulted in at least 15 deaths and displaced tens of thousands of civilians. A ceasefire was declared, and a United Nations court ordered both countries to withdraw troops and establish a demilitarized zone. However, the court did not resolve the dispute over the larger disputed territory, leading to continued clashes.\n\n**Escalation in 2025**\n\nThe border dispute worsened in May 2025, when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a skirmish between the two countries. This incident brought relations between the countries to a low point in years. In an attempt to resolve the tensions, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra spoke with Cambodia's de facto leader, Hun Sen, on June 15.\n\n**Controversial Phone Call**\n\nHowever, a recording of the call, posted by Hun Sen on his Facebook page, sparked outrage in Thailand. Paetongtarn appeared to disparage the Thai military, referring to it as \"the opposite side,\" and called Hun Sen \"uncle.\" She also offered to \"arrange\" anything he wanted. Thai lawmakers condemned her comments, accusing her of violating ethics standards and taking a deferential tone with another country's leader. The controversy led to calls for her resignation.\n\n**Consequences**\n\nOn July 1, Thailand's Constitutional Court suspended Paetongtarn, accepting a petition to remove her from office. She apologized, stating that her conversation with Hun Sen was not motivated by personal gain. However, the situation continued to deteriorate. On July 23, a Thai soldier lost his right leg in a land mine explosion. In response, Thailand downgraded diplomatic relations with Cambodia, recalling its ambassador to Cambodia and expelling Cambodia's ambassador.\n\n**Current Situation**\n\nThe conflict escalated further on July 24, when Cambodian and Thai troops engaged in deadly clashes along their contested border. Thai officials reported that at least a dozen people were killed, and residents were evacuated. The clashes have strained diplomatic relations between the two countries, with no clear resolution in sight.\n",

The Cambodian Defense Ministry reported that two bombs were dropped from a Thai aircraft on a road.\n\n**Background and Causes of the Conflict**\n\nThe conflict between Thailand and Cambodia centers on a disputed territory claimed by both countries, which dates back to colonial-era French maps and unresolved demarcation. The dispute has led to periodic skirmishes since 2008, with the latest round of clashes beginning in late May 2025. The tensions have been fueled by recent landmine incidents that injured Thai soldiers, which Thailand blames on Cambodia.\n\n**Details of the Airstrike and Clashes**\n\nThe airstrike targeted a Cambodian military position near the disputed 11th-century Prasat Ta Muen Thom temple. According to Thai officials, 11 civilians were killed by Cambodian artillery fire. Online video footage showed a petrol station ablaze, allegedly after being hit by a Cambodian rocket. The clashes have prompted Thai authorities to order evacuations of villages in four border provinces.\n\n**Reactions from Both Countries**\n\nCambodia's Foreign Ministry accused Thailand of conducting \"unprovoked, premeditated, and deliberate attacks\" and asserted that the country was acting in self-defense. Phnom Penh condemned Bangkok's actions and called for the withdrawal of Thai troops to \"their side\" of the frontier. Thailand's Foreign Ministry responded by blaming Cambodia for the escalation, citing recent landmine incidents that injured Thai soldiers. The ministry also reported that Cambodian heavy artillery targeted a Thai military base on Thursday.\n\n**Diplomatic Fallout**\n\nThe airstrike and clashes have led to a significant diplomatic fallout between the two countries.

The violence began on Thursday morning, with clashes reported in at least six areas along the border. Both nations have accused each other of initiating the gunfire, which has led to a significant escalation of tensions.\n\n**Causes of the Conflict**\n\nThe conflict has its roots in a long-standing border dispute between the two Southeast Asian nations. The most significant point of contention is the 1,000-year-old Preah Vihear temple, which was granted sovereignty to Cambodia by the International Court of Justice in 1962. However, Thailand has continued to claim ownership of the temple, leading to intermittent tensions and violent confrontations.\n\nThe current escalation began in May when a Cambodian soldier was killed in an armed confrontation over disputed territory. Since then, nationalist passions on both sides have inflamed the situation, with both nations accusing each other of aggression.\n\n**Recent Clashes and Casualties**\n\nOn Thursday, Thai officials reported that at least 12 civilians had died in fresh clashes along the border. The most casualties occurred in Si Sa Ket province, where six people were killed after shots were fired at a fuel station. At least 14 people were injured in three border provinces, according to Thai authorities.\n\nThe Thai army confirmed that it had launched airstrikes on ground targets within Cambodia, while the Cambodian Defence Ministry claimed that Thailand's army used jets to drop bombs on a road near the ancient Preah Vihear temple.\n\n**Diplomatic Relations**\n\nThe conflict has also led to a significant deterioration in diplomatic relations between the two nations. Cambodia announced on Thursday that it was downgrading diplomatic relations with Thailand to their lowest level, expelling the Thai ambassador and recalling all Cambodian staff from its embassy in Bangkok.\n\nThis move was in response to Thailand closing its northeastern border crossings with Cambodia, withdrawing its ambassador and expelling the Cambodian ambassador on Wednesday following a land mine blast that injured five Thai soldiers.\n\n**Nationalist Fervor and Government Response**\n\nNationalist fervor on both sides has heightened tensions further, with Thai Prime Minister being suspended from office on July 1 pending investigation into potential ethics breaches regarding her management of the border row.\n\nThe Thai embassy in Phnom Penh has called upon Thai citizens in Cambodia to depart the country where possible and recommended others avoid traveling to Cambodia unless utterly essential.\n\n**Historical Context**\n\nThe border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia has a long and complex history. The two nations have had intermittent tensions and violent confrontations over the years, including a 2011 conflict that resulted in approximately 20 fatalities and displaced thousands.\n\nThe International Court of Justice has ruled in favor of Cambodia's sovereignty over the Preah Vihear temple, but Thailand has continued to claim ownership.

The conflict began on July 24, 2025, and has raised concerns about the safety of tourists traveling to the region.\n\n**The Conflict**\n\nThe clashes occurred in several areas along the 817-kilometer (508-mile) land border between Thailand's Surin province and Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey province. The Thai army reported that most casualties occurred in the Si Sa Ket province, where six people were killed, including an eight-year-old boy. The Thai foreign ministry accused Cambodian troops of firing \"heavy artillery\" on a Thai military base and civilian areas, including a hospital. In response, the Thai army said a Thai F-16 fighter jet bombed military targets in Cambodia.\n\n**Causes of the Escalation**\n\nThe dispute between Thailand and Cambodia dates back over a century, with both countries claiming sovereignty over certain areas along their border. Tensions were reignited in May 2025 after a Cambodian soldier was killed during a brief exchange of gunfire. Despite agreements to de-escalate tensions, both countries have implemented restrictions on each other, including tighter border controls, trade bans, and diplomatic expulsions.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe border dispute largely stems from a 1907 map drawn under French colonial rule, which was used to separate Cambodia from Thailand. Cambodia has used the map as a reference to claim territory, while Thailand has argued that the map is inaccurate. The most prominent and violent conflicts have been over the 1,000-year-old Preah Vihear temple, which was awarded to Cambodia by the International Court of Justice in 1962.\n\n**Current Situation**\n\nClashes are ongoing in at least six areas along the border, according to the Thai defence ministry. Cambodia has downgraded diplomatic relations with Thailand to their lowest level, expelling the Thai ambassador and recalling all Cambodian staff from its embassy in Bangkok. Thailand had previously withdrawn its ambassador and expelled the Cambodian ambassador in protest against land mine blasts that injured eight Thai soldiers.\n\n**Travel Safety**\n\nThe UK Foreign Office (FCDO) has updated its travel advice, warning British nationals to \"exercise a high level of vigilance in border areas\" and \"follow the instructions of local authorities.\" The US Embassy in Thailand has also released new advice, telling US citizens to \"follow direction from Thai security services and consult local government authorities for the latest information.\"\n\n**Political Fallout**\n\nThe conflict has also had significant political fallout. Thailand's former prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, attempted to resolve tensions via a call with Cambodia's influential former prime minister, Hun Sen. However, her comments were leaked, causing widespread outrage and protests, and leading to her suspension from her position on July 1, 2025.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe conflict between Thailand and Cambodia is a complex and long-standing issue that has escalated into military clashes. The situation remains volatile, and tourists are advised to exercise caution when traveling to the region. The international community is closely monitoring the situation, and efforts are being made to de-escalate tensions and resolve the border dispute peacefully.\n",

The clashes, which involved small arms, artillery, and rockets, left at least 11 people dead, mostly civilians, and 28 injured.\n\n**Background and Trigger for Clashes**\n\nThe trigger for the clashes was a mine explosion along the border on Wednesday, July 23, that wounded five Thai soldiers. Thailand attributed the mine blast to Cambodia, alleging that the mines were newly laid and of Russian origin, not used by the Thai military. Cambodia rejected Thailand's account as \"baseless accusations,\" pointing out that many unexploded mines and other ordnance are a legacy of 20th-century wars and unrest.\n\n**Clashes and Casualties**\n\nThe first clash occurred in the morning near the ancient Ta Muen Thom temple along the border of Thailand's Surin province and Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey province. Thai villagers were seen fleeing their homes to seek shelter as the clashes began. Fighting was ongoing in at least six areas along the border, according to Thai Defense Ministry spokesperson Surasant Kongsiri.\n\nThe Thai army reported that it had launched airstrikes on military targets in Cambodia, while the Cambodian Defense Ministry said that Thai jets dropped bombs on a road near the ancient Preah Vihear temple, a site of past conflicts between the countries. Thailand's Foreign Ministry accused Cambodia of attacking both military and non-military sites in Thailand, including a hospital.\n\n**Each Side Blames the Other**\n\nThe two sides have differing accounts of who initiated the clashes. The Thai army said it saw a drone before seeing six armed Cambodian soldiers moving closer to Thai military positions, and that Thai soldiers tried to defuse the situation but were met with fire from the Cambodian side. Cambodia's Defense Ministry, however, said that Thailand deployed a drone first and opened fire, and that Cambodia acted in self-defense.\n\n**International Response**\n\nCambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet wrote to the current president of the U.N. Security Council, asking for an urgent meeting to address what he termed \"Thailand's aggression.\" Thailand's acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai reported that 11 people had died, including 10 civilians and one soldier, and 28 had been injured, four of whom were soldiers.\n\n**Diplomatic Fallout**\n\nThe clashes have led to a significant deterioration in diplomatic relations between the two countries. On Wednesday, Thailand withdrew its ambassador to Cambodia and expelled the Cambodian ambassador. Cambodia downgraded diplomatic relations, recalling all Cambodian staff from its embassy in Bangkok. Thailand has also sealed all land border crossings and urged its citizens to leave Cambodia.\n\n**Context and Implications**\n\nThe border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia is not new, with periodic flare-ups along their frontier. However, relations have deteriorated sharply since a confrontation in May that killed a Cambodian soldier. The current clashes are far bigger in scale and intensity than usual, and have significant implications for regional stability and international relations. The incident has also had political fallout in Thailand, with Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra facing criticism for her handling of the situation and subsequently being suspended from office pending an investigation.\n",

      "Source: The Indian Express - World\nTitle: Thailand and Cambodia exchange fire in clashes that kill at least 9 civilians\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 03:10:50 +0000\nSummary:\n**Summary of Thailand and Cambodia Clashes**\n\nClashes between Thailand and Cambodia have resulted in the deaths of at least 9 civilians, with thousands more evacuated from their homes. The violence began after a series of landmine incidents injured Thai soldiers near disputed zones, which Thailand claims were newly laid, Russian-made devices. Cambodia has denied these accusations, and the two countries have engaged in a heated exchange of fire, with Thailand conducting airstrikes on what it described as a Cambodian military target.\n\n**Background and Causes of the Clashes**\n\nThe recent escalation follows a string of landmine incidents that injured Thai soldiers near disputed zones. Thailand claims the explosives were newly laid, Russian-made devices, while Cambodia has called these accusations \"baseless.\" On Wednesday, five Thai soldiers were wounded by a mine blast, and a similar incident a week earlier left another soldier without a foot. Cambodian officials insist that Thai troops entered their territory, prompting defensive fire.\n\n**Airstrikes and Clashes**\n\nThailand confirmed that one of its six readied F-16 fighter jets had conducted airstrikes on a Cambodian military target. However, Cambodian officials countered that the Thai aircraft dropped two bombs on a public road near the historic Preah Vihear temple. The clashes erupted in at least six areas, with the first skirmish reported near the Ta Muen Thom temple. A livestream from the Thai side showed residents fleeing to fortified shelters as explosions echoed in the background.\n\n**Civilian Casualties and Evacuations**\n\nThe clashes have resulted in significant civilian casualties and evacuations. Thai officials reported that six people were killed after artillery fire struck a gas station in Si Sa Ket province. Two more civilians died in Surin province, and authorities evacuated around 40,000 residents from 86 villages as shelling intensified.\n\n**Diplomatic Fallout**\n\nThe clashes have led to a significant deterioration in relations between the two countries. Both nations have expelled each other's ambassadors, and Thailand has sealed off all land border crossings. Cambodia has recalled its embassy staff from Bangkok. Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has warned that further aggression would prompt intensified self-defense.\n\n**Historical Context**\n\nThe territorial tensions between Thailand and Cambodia, particularly around the Preah Vihear temple, have simmered for decades. The International Court of Justice awarded sovereignty over the temple to Cambodia in 1962, a decision reaffirmed in 2013 after deadly border clashes in 2011.\n\n**Domestic Impact**\n\nThe violence has triggered political upheaval in Thailand, where Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was suspended after a leaked call with Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen stirred controversy over her handling of the crisis. Thailand's acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai has acknowledged the sensitivity of the situation, stating that Thailand will follow international law.\n\n**Current Situation**\n\nThe situation remains volatile, with both countries on high alert. The clashes have resulted in significant human suffering, and the diplomatic fallout has led to a breakdown in relations between the two countries. The international community is watching the situation closely, and there are concerns about the potential for further escalation.\n",
