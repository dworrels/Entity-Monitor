      "Source: NBC - Top News\nTitle: Trump Announces New Trade Deal with Japan\nDate: Wed, 23 Jul 2025 11:24:55 GMT\nSummary:\nOn July 23, 2025, President Donald Trump announced a new trade deal with Japan, marking a significant milestone in the country's trade policy. According to the agreement, Japan will impose a 15% import tax on goods coming from the United States. In return, Trump said that Japan will make a \"more than a half-trillion-dollar\" investment in the United States.\n\nThe deal, which was announced at the White House, is seen as a significant victory for Trump, who has been keen to renegotiate existing trade agreements and reduce the US trade deficit. The 15% import tax on Japanese goods is expected to generate revenue for the US government and boost domestic industries, such as manufacturing and agriculture.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump stressed that the agreement is a \"win-win\" for both countries, citing the significant investment Japan will make in the US as a major benefit. He claimed that the investment will create jobs and stimulate economic growth, contributing to the overall prosperity of both nations.\n\nThe details of the investment were not disclosed during the announcement, but Trump stated that it would cover a range of sectors, including technology, infrastructure, and energy. He also hinted that the deal could potentially lead to greater cooperation between the two countries in areas such as research and development, defense, and security.\n\nThe announcement was met with mixed reactions from lawmakers and business leaders. Some have praised the deal as a major step forward in trade policy, while others have expressed concerns about the impact of the 15% import tax on Japanese goods. Japan's Prime Minister has yet to publicly comment on the agreement, but it is expected that the government will issue a statement soon.\n\nThe trade deal with Japan is the latest development in Trump's efforts to revamp the US trade policy, which has been a major focus of his presidency. The Administration has already renegotiated trade agreements with Canada and Mexico, and has imposed tariffs on goods from China, citing allegations of unfair trade practices. The deal with Japan is seen as a major achievement for Trump, and could set a precedent for future trade agreements with other countries.\n",

The decision is seen as a blow to Colbert's career and a reflection of the industry's declining ratings and revenue due to cord-cutting and changing viewer habits.

Jimmy Fallon also separately poked fun at Colbert's situation.

As the format continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how late-night hosts will navigate this new landscape, but the united response from Colbert's peers suggests that they are prepared to fight for the future of late-night TV.\n"
