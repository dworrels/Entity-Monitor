      "Source: ABC13 Houston\nTitle: It's a back-to-school shopping spree as families rush to beat tariffs\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 15:05:17 +0000\nSummary:\n### Summary of Back-to-School Shopping Trends\n\nThe article discusses the current back-to-school shopping trends in the United States, highlighting the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on consumer behavior. With concerns about potential price increases due to tariffs, families are starting their back-to-school shopping earlier than ever before.\n\n### Early Shopping and Tariff Concerns\n\n* Two-thirds of Americans with school-aged children have already started shopping for the upcoming school year, with half of them doing so specifically because they are worried about tariffs increasing prices.\n* The National Retail Federation (NRF) survey found that many school essentials, such as backpacks, clothing, and electronics, are imported into the United States, making them susceptible to tariff-related price hikes.\n* As a result, consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores, and summer sales for savings on school essentials.\n\n### Tariffs and Trade Agreements\n\n* Tariffs on most of America's trading partners are set to rise on August 1, unless they can make a trade deal with the United States before then.\n* On July 23, Trump announced a trade agreement with Japan, setting a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. Most countries are operating under a 10% universal tariff, while China faces a 30% tariff until August 12.\n\n### Changes in Spending Habits\n\n* Despite shopping earlier, Americans are expected to spend about $858 per family on clothes, school supplies, and electronics this year, which is 2% less than last year.\n* Shoppers are pulling back on spending and are more focused on value and necessity. There is a trend of \"trading down\" from branded to private-label products as consumers look to stretch their budgets.\n\n### Retailers' Strategies\n\n* Retailers are competing for every dollar and are offering discounts and promotions to attract budget-conscious shoppers. For example:\n\t+ Target's back-to-school event advertises savings of 30% and promises not to raise prices on 20 of the most popular school supplies and backpacks.\n\t+ Walmart says 14 of their most popular school supplies cost less than last year, and 70% of Walmart shoppers plan to spend more time looking for discounts this year.\n\t+ Amazon's four-day Prime event in July saw a 30% increase in spending compared to the previous year, with back-to-school supply sales up 175%.\n\n### Impact of Tariffs on Consumers\n\n* Retail analysts predict that the impact of tariffs on consumers will be felt soon, as retailers start to run through the inventory they imported before tariffs took effect. This should happen this month, with American consumers feeling the impact in about 2 to 4 weeks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the back-to-school shopping season has started earlier than ever before, driven by concerns about tariffs and potential price increases. Consumers are being mindful of their spending, trading down to more affordable options, and seeking discounts and promotions. Retailers are responding by offering savings and competing for every dollar. However, the impact of tariffs on consumers is expected to be felt soon, leading to potential price increases in the near future.\n",
      "Source: Fast Company\nTitle: U.S. automakers voice concerns over Trump\u2019s 15% tariff deal with Japan\nDate: 2025-07-24T13:43:32\nSummary:\nThe article discusses the concerns of US automakers regarding a trade agreement between the Trump administration and Japan, which imposes a 15% tariff on Japanese vehicles imported to the US. The American Automotive Policy Council, representing General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, expressed worries that the deal would put them at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nThe main concern is that US automakers face steeper import taxes on steel, aluminum, and parts (50% on steel and aluminum, and 25% on parts and finished vehicles) compared to their Japanese competitors, who will only face a 15% tariff on their vehicles. This could lead to a significant disadvantage for US automakers in the market.\n\nThe United Auto Workers (UAW) also expressed their dissatisfaction with the deal, stating that it does not hold Japanese automakers to the same standards as US workers and could lead to a \"race to the bottom\" in terms of labor and environmental regulations.\n\nThe agreement, announced by President Trump, aims to add hundreds of thousands of jobs to the US economy and open the Japanese market to American vehicles. However, the UAW and US automakers are skeptical about the deal's potential benefits.\n\nAccording to Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, the agreement will charge lower tariffs on Japanese autos with no US content, putting domestic automakers at a disadvantage. Blunt also expressed skepticism that simply having an open market in Japan will be sufficient to increase US vehicle exports.\n\nThe deal also includes a $550 billion investment in US projects by Japan, directed by the president. However, some analysts argue that this could give Japan and other countries a competitive edge in the US market.\n\nAutos Drive America, an organization representing Japanese automakers such as Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, welcomed the agreement and urged the Trump administration to reach similar deals with other allies and partners.\n\nThe article concludes that the agreement could have significant implications for the US automotive industry and trade relationships with other countries. It may also lead to negotiations between the US and other countries, including Canada and Mexico, to revisit their trade agreements.\n\nSome key points from the article:\n\n* US automakers face a competitive disadvantage due to higher import taxes on steel, aluminum, and parts compared to Japanese competitors.\n* The 15% tariff on Japanese vehicles could lead to increased imports and a disadvantage for US automakers.\n* The UAW and US automakers are skeptical about the deal's potential benefits and express concerns about labor and environmental regulations.\n* The agreement includes a $550 billion investment in US projects by Japan.\n* The deal could have significant implications for trade relationships with other countries and may lead to negotiations to revisit existing trade agreements.\n\nOverall, the article highlights the complexities of international trade agreements and the challenges of balancing competing interests in the automotive industry.\n",
      "Source: Fast Company\nTitle: Trump\u2019s feud with Jerome Powell escalates as he prepares to visit the Fed headquarters\nDate: 2025-07-24T13:15:06\nSummary:\nThe article reports on the escalating feud between President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, which is set to continue with Trump's visit to the Fed headquarters in Washington on Thursday. The tension between the two has been building over several issues, primarily centered around Powell's handling of monetary policy and a contentious renovation project at the Fed's headquarters.\n\nThe main point of contention between Trump and Powell is the Fed's decision to keep short-term interest rates at 4.3% this year, after cutting them three times last year. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates further to boost the economy, which he believes will help him achieve his economic goals. Powell, on the other hand, has maintained that the Fed wants to assess the impact of Trump's tariffs on imports, which could potentially lead to higher inflation.\n\nThe renovation project at the Fed's headquarters has also become a source of conflict between the two. The project, which involves the renovation of the Fed's Washington headquarters and a neighboring building, has seen its estimated cost balloon to $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion. Trump has expressed outrage over the cost overrun, calling it \"disgraceful\" and suggesting that it could be grounds for firing Powell.\n\nWhen asked last week if the costly renovation could lead to Powell's dismissal, Trump said, \"I think it is.\" This statement has raised concerns about the potential threat to the Fed's independence, which is widely regarded as essential for the central bank's effective functioning. Most economists and Wall Street investors believe that the Fed's independence is crucial for maintaining the stability of the financial system.\n\nFiring Powell would be a significant move that could have far-reaching consequences for the economy and the financial markets. It could be seen as a politicization of the Fed, which could undermine its credibility and effectiveness. The article notes that the Fed's independence has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors, who believe that it allows the central bank to make decisions based on economic considerations rather than political pressures.\n\nOverall, the article suggests that the feud between Trump and Powell is likely to continue, with Trump's visit to the Fed headquarters potentially leading to further confrontation. The implications of this conflict are significant, not just for the economy and financial markets but also for the future of the Fed and its role in setting monetary policy.\n",
      "Source: Fast Company\nTitle: Chipotle\u2019s CEO just shared the reason why sales have been down. Many fast food fans will relate\nDate: 2025-07-24T13:10:00\nSummary:\nHere is a detailed summary of the article:\n\n**Chipotle's Sales Down**\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill recently announced its second-quarter financial results for 2025, and the news is not positive. The fast-casual restaurant chain failed to meet its quarterly sales estimates and reduced its targeted annual sales growth. As a result, Chipotle's stock price plummeted over 12% in premarket trading.\n\n**Financial Results**\n\nChipotle reported a net income of $436.1 million (32 cents per diluted share), which is a decrease from $455.7 million (33 cents per diluted share) year-over-year (YOY). Despite a 3% increase in total revenue, which reached $3.1 billion, the company attributed this growth to the opening of 61 new restaurants. However, comparable sales at existing restaurants actually dropped 4%, with smaller bills being a contributing factor. This decline was worse than Wall Street's predictions of a 2.9% decrease.\n\n**Reasons for Decline**\n\nAccording to Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright, the company's decline is due to \"ongoing volatility\" in consumer environment trends. Specifically, Boatwright cited that low-income consumers are looking for value and are sensitive to price points. Additionally, tariffs are estimated to have increased Chipotle's cost of sales by 0.5%.\n\n**Broader Trend**\n\nChipotle's decline is part of a broader trend in the fast food industry. According to a report by Revenue Management Solutions (RMS), fast food restaurants saw a 0.9% decrease in traffic year-over-year during quarter two. At the same time, prices at quick-service restaurants increased by 1.3% year-over-year, although this is less than the 3.1% increase seen in quarter one. The average bill at Chipotle increased by 0.9%.\n\n**Impact on Outlook**\n\nAs a result of its disappointing financial results, Chipotle reduced its targeted annual sales growth. The company's stock price has taken a hit, and investors are likely to be watching closely to see if Chipotle can recover from this decline.\n",
      "Source: CNBC - World\nTitle: Moncler raises prices on tariffs, may postpone store openings if downturn worsens\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 13:09:34 GMT\nSummary:\n### Moncler's Pricing Strategy and Future Outlook\n\nItalian luxury fashion house Moncler has announced plans to raise prices on its products to offset the impact of US tariffs. The company has increased prices by \"mid-single-digit\" percentages for the second half of 2025 and plans to raise them again for the first half of 2026.\n\n### Impact of US Tariffs\n\nThe price increases are a response to the initial impact of US tariffs on Moncler's business. The company is awaiting further clarity on US levies before finalizing its pricing strategy for 2026. Moncler's Chief Business Strategy and Global Market Officer, Roberto Eggs, stated that the company intends to keep future price rises \"more conservative\" to balance higher input costs with customer retention.\n\n### Financial Performance\n\nMoncler's second-quarter sales dipped due to weak tourist flows, despite robust domestic demand in the US and China. Group revenues fell 1% year-on-year at constant exchange rates to \u20ac396.6 million ($536.7 million) in the three months to June 30, below the \u20ac427.2 million forecast by analysts. The US market, which accounts for 14% of Moncler brand sales, recorded a 5% sales uptick in the quarter. However, it is unclear whether this growth was driven by shoppers accelerating purchases ahead of the ramping up of tariffs.\n\n### Regional Sales Performance\n\n* Asia, Moncler's largest market, saw flat sales in the quarter.\n* Europe, the Middle East, and Africa recorded an 8% decline in sales, attributed to a rebalancing of the Japanese yen and soft tourist spending in Europe.\n* Japan was the only Asian country to record negative sales growth.\n\n### Future Plans and Flexibility\n\nMoncler has plans to open a dozen or so new stores in 2026, but the company is flexible on these plans and may postpone some openings if the macro outlook does not improve. The company will finalize its plans for 2026 by October. Moncler's shares were down 4% by 2 p.m. London time (9 a.m. E.T.) on the day of the earnings call.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n* Moncler is raising prices to offset US tariffs, with mid-single-digit percentage increases in the second half of 2025 and further increases planned for 2026.\n* The company's second-quarter sales dipped due to weak tourist flows, despite robust domestic demand in the US and China.\n* Moncler is cautious on the outlook and may postpone new store openings if the economic downturn worsens.\n* The company is keeping a close eye on macro trends and currency movements to inform its pricing strategy.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe article highlights the challenges faced by Moncler and the luxury sector as a whole, including the impact of US tariffs and weak tourist flows. The company's decision to raise prices and postpone new store openings if necessary demonstrates its cautious approach to the current market conditions. As Moncler's Chief Business Strategy and Global Market Officer, Roberto Eggs, noted, \"Clearly, the pricing today for consumers is a concern. I think we need to pay even more attention on this.\" The company's flexibility on its plans for 2026 and its focus on balancing higher input costs with customer retention are key strategies in navigating the complex and evolving luxury market.\n",
      "Source: Russia Today - World\nTitle: EU poised to retaliate over US tariffs \u2013 media\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 12:48:43 +0000\nSummary:\nThe European Union (EU) is preparing to retaliate against the United States (US) over tariffs imposed by the US, according to media reports. The EU has compiled a list of US goods worth \u20ac93 billion ($109 billion) that could face 15% import tariffs unless a compromise is reached with Washington by August. The list of targeted products was finalized on Thursday morning, with Hungary being the only EU member to vote against the measure.\n\nThe EU's move is in response to the US's accusations of unfair trade practices by its trading partners, and the use of tariff threats as leverage in negotiations. The US, under President Donald Trump, has imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminum, prompting the EU to prepare countermeasures.\n\nThe EU's list of targeted US goods includes a wide range of products such as aircraft, automobiles and auto parts, orange juice, poultry, soybeans, steel, aluminum, and yachts. Notably, bourbon whiskey has also been included on the list, despite intense lobbying by France and Ireland, who feared US retaliation against their own wine and spirits exports.\n\nThe proposed EU tariffs would go into effect on August 7, unless a compromise is reached with the US before then. The EU hopes to reach a framework agreement similar to the one struck between the US and Japan, which would exempt certain industries from the 15% US tariff. These industries could include aircraft, lumber, select medicines, and agricultural products.\n\nThe move has been met with criticism from Russian officials, who argue that the EU remains vulnerable to US pressure and portray the bloc's leaders as weak and subservient to Washington's policy agenda. Dmitry Medvedev, the Deputy Chair of Russian Security Council, has remarked that the EU economy is decaying and that Russia should take advantage of the situation.\n\nThe EU, however, says it is seeking a negotiated solution and is preparing countermeasures only in case talks fail. The bloc's trade spokesman, Olof Gill, has stated that the EU's goal is to make the countermeasures \"clearer, simpler, and stronger.\" The EU's proposed tariffs are seen as a way to put pressure on the US to negotiate a resolution to the trade dispute.\n\nOverall, the situation highlights the ongoing trade tensions between the EU and the US, with both sides preparing for a potential trade war. The EU's proposed tariffs are a response to the US's protectionist policies, and the situation is being closely watched by other countries, including Russia, which is seeking to take advantage of the situation.\n",
      "Source: The Globe and Mail - World\nTitle: EU says U.S. trade deal is within reach, while approving potential countermeasures\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 12:14:09 +0000\nSummary:\nThe European Commission has stated that a negotiated trade solution with the United States is within reach, despite the two parties being on the brink of imposing tariffs on each other's goods. The EU's executive arm has been trying to avert a 30% tariff on EU goods imported into the US, which US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose on August 1.\n\n### Background and Current Situation \n\nThe EU and US have been engaged in trade talks, with the EU seeking to prevent the tariffs. On Thursday, EU members voted to approve counter-tariffs on $109 billion (approximately \u20ac93 billion) of US goods, in case the talks collapse. The counter-tariffs would be imposed in two stages, with the first package entering force on August 7, and the second package entering force in two stages on September 7 and February 7.\n\n### Potential Trade Deal \n\nDespite the approval of countermeasures, the EU remains committed to finding a negotiated solution with the US. EU diplomats suggest that a possible trade deal could result in a broad 15% tariff on EU goods imported into the US, mirroring a framework agreement that Washington struck with Japan. This deal would not add to the existing long-standing US duties, which average around 5%.\n\n### Key Aspects of the Potential Deal \n\nThe potential deal could include:\n\n* A 15% tariff on EU goods imported into the US\n* Exemptions for sectors such as aircraft, lumber, and some medicines and agricultural products\n* No reduction in the US's 50% tariff on steel\n\n### US Response and Uncertainty \n\nThe White House has downplayed the report, stating that discussions of a deal should be considered \"speculation.\" Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro told Bloomberg News that the report from the EU should be taken with \"a grain of salt.\" French Finance Minister Eric Lombard and Italian Industry Minister Adolfo Urso expressed skepticism, stating that they were not aware of a draft agreement.\n\n### Possible EU Concessions \n\nIt is unclear what the EU would offer the US to secure a deal. One EU diplomat suggested that the bloc was not looking at a pledge of investment in the US, as Japan has agreed. Another suggested that the EU might reduce some of its own duties, such as its current 10% import duty on cars.\n\n### Implications \n\nThe EU's efforts to reach a deal with the US are aimed at preventing a trade war that could have significant economic implications. A 30% tariff on EU goods imported into the US could lead to retaliatory measures from the EU, resulting in higher prices for consumers and reduced economic growth.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nIn conclusion, the EU and US are on the brink of imposing tariffs on each other's goods, but a negotiated trade solution is still within reach. The EU has approved counter-tariffs on $109 billion of US goods, while diplomats suggest that a possible trade deal could result in a broad 15% tariff on EU goods imported into the US. The US has downplayed the report, and it remains unclear what the EU would offer the US to secure a deal.\n",

According to the article, the Prime Ministers of both countries, Keir Starmer (U.K.) and Narendra Modi (India), have announced a long-awaited trade agreement, which they have described as historic.\n\nThe agreement aims to reduce tariffs on various products traded between the two nations. Specifically, it will lead to lower tariffs on U.K. products such as Scotch whisky and English gin exported to India. Conversely, Indian food products and spices shipped to the U.K. will also face reduced tariffs.\n\nThe article highlights that the agreement was hard-wrought, implying that negotiations were likely difficult and protracted. Nevertheless, the deal is expected to boost trade between the two countries and strengthen their economic ties.\n\nThe Prime Ministers of both nations have expressed their satisfaction with the agreement, characterizing it as a historic achievement. While the article does not provide further details on the agreement, such as its exact terms, timeline for implementation, or estimated economic impact, it suggests that the deal marks a significant milestone in India-U.K. trade relations.\n",
      "Source: France 24\nTitle: Chinese EV maker Zeekr expands EU presence in spite of tariffs\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 11:50:04 GMT\nSummary:\nThe article discusses the expansion of Zeekr, a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, into the European Union (EU) market, despite facing tariffs imposed by the EU on Chinese EVs. Here is a detailed summary:\n\n**Background:** The EU has imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, including Zeekr, due to what it considers to be unfair trade practices. This issue is on the agenda of an EU-China summit in Beijing, where European leaders are attending.\n\n**Zeekr's Expansion:** Despite the tariffs, Zeekr is expanding its presence in the EU market. The company's acting CEO for Europe, Lothar Schupet, shares his insights on the impact of these trade restrictions on the business.\n\n**Tariffs and Trade Restrictions:** The EU's tariffs on Chinese EVs are a result of concerns over unfair trade practices. The tariffs aim to level the playing field for European manufacturers, but they also pose a challenge to Chinese EV makers like Zeekr that are looking to expand into the EU market.\n\n**Zeekr's Strategy:** By expanding in the EU, Zeekr is demonstrating its commitment to the European market. The company's strategy likely involves finding ways to mitigate the impact of tariffs, such as adjusting pricing, optimizing supply chains, or exploring partnerships with local companies.\n\n**Interview with Lothar Schupet:** The article mentions an interview with Lothar Schupet, acting CEO of Zeekr Europe, which likely provides more insights into the company's plans and experiences in the EU market. Unfortunately, the article does not provide specific details from the interview.\n\n**Context:** The EU-China summit in Beijing provides a platform for European leaders to discuss trade issues, including the tariffs on Chinese EVs, with their Chinese counterparts. The summit may lead to some developments or agreements on trade, which could potentially affect Zeekr's business and the broader EU-China trade relationship.\n\nOverall, the article highlights Zeekr's determination to expand its presence in the EU market, despite the challenges posed by tariffs and trade restrictions. The company's strategy and experiences will likely be closely watched by industry observers and may provide valuable insights into the complexities of international trade and the EV market.\n",
      "Source: France 24\nTitle: EU tariffs on chinese EVs strain trade and diplomatic ties with Beijing\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 11:49:11 GMT\nSummary:\nThe article appears to be about the European Union's (EU) imposition of tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) and how it is affecting trade and diplomatic relations with Beijing. Here is a detailed summary:\n\n**EU Tariffs on Chinese EVs**\n\nThe EU has introduced tariffs on Chinese EVs, which is causing strain on trade and diplomatic ties with Beijing. The tariffs are likely aimed at protecting the EU's domestic EV industry and addressing concerns about China's unfair trade practices.\n\n**Impact on Trade**\n\nThe tariffs on Chinese EVs are expected to increase the cost of these vehicles in the EU market, making them less competitive. This could lead to a decline in imports of Chinese EVs, which could have a significant impact on China's economy. China is a major player in the global EV market, and the EU is one of its largest export markets.\n\n**Strain on Diplomatic Ties**\n\nThe imposition of tariffs on Chinese EVs is also likely to strain diplomatic ties between the EU and China. The move could be seen as a protectionist measure by China, which could lead to retaliatory actions. The EU and China have a complex and multifaceted relationship, with the EU being China's largest trading partner.\n\n**Potential Consequences**\n\nThe tariffs on Chinese EVs could have several consequences, including:\n\n* Increased tensions between the EU and China, which could affect not only trade but also cooperation on other issues such as climate change and security.\n* A decline in Chinese EV exports to the EU, which could lead to job losses and economic disruption in China.\n* A rise in protectionism, which could lead to a more fragmented and less open global economy.\n\n**Advertisement and Video Content**\n\nThe article also mentions a video from YouTube, which is not accessible due to browser extension issues. However, this does not appear to be relevant to the main topic of the article.\n\nOverall, the article highlights the complex and sensitive nature of EU-China trade relations, particularly in the EV sector. The imposition of tariffs on Chinese EVs is likely to have significant consequences for trade and diplomatic ties between the two sides.\n",
      "Source: Al Jazeera\nTitle: Fact check: Could Trump\u2019s trade tariffs pay off the US deficit?\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 11:45:42 +0000\nSummary:\nThe article examines the claim made by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could help pay off the US deficit. Lutnick stated that the US is collecting around $30 billion a month in tariffs, which he believes will \"pay off our deficit\" and \"make America stronger.\" However, an analysis of the numbers reveals that this claim is unlikely to be true.\n\nAccording to the article, the US government collected about $100 billion in tariffs from the beginning of the year up to July 11, which is more than double the amount collected during the same period in 2024. In June 2025, the most recent monthly data available, the federal government collected $27 billion in tariffs, a significant increase from $6 billion in June 2024.\n\nIf the government were to continue collecting tariff revenue at the June 2025 pace for a full decade (120 months), it would produce $2.52 trillion in tariff revenue. This estimate is similar to a projection by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which expects tariff revenues to reach $2.8 trillion over the next 10 years.\n\nHowever, the article notes that this amount is only a fraction of the nearly $22 trillion in cumulative deficits projected over the next 10 years. The CBO's baseline projection for the cumulative deficits over the next 10 years is almost $21.8 trillion, which is about seven times the size of the CBO's projected tariff revenues over the same period.\n\nFurthermore, the article points out that the projected tariff revenue under Trump would not fully cover the added deficits just from the \"megabill\" Trump signed into law on July 4. According to CBO estimates, the law will raise deficits by $3.4 trillion beyond their previous trajectory over the next 10 years, which exceeds CBO's tariff revenue projection.\n\nThe article also highlights the uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policies, as he has frequently announced and then paused higher tariffs. This uncertainty makes it difficult to predict how much tariff revenue Trump's policies will generate.\n\nAdditionally, the article notes that Trump's tariff policies have been challenged in court, and if the initial ruling by the Court of International Trade is upheld on appeal, Trump would lose his power to unilaterally enact many of the tariffs he has been imposing. Even if Trump's tariff powers are upheld on appeal, his successor could reverse them by executive order, meaning any tariff revenues would only cover the next four years, not the next 10 years.\n\nIn conclusion, the article finds that Lutnick's claim that tariffs will pay off the US deficit is unlikely to be true. While the Trump administration's tariff revenues have increased significantly, they are still only a fraction of the projected deficits over the next 10 years. Therefore, the article concludes that it is unlikely that tariffs will eliminate the deficit, as Lutnick claimed.\n",
      "Source: Forbes - Business\nTitle: Tariff Uncertainty Hurts Toy Sales In Q2, Hasbro And Mattel Reports\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 07:42:01 -0400\nSummary:\nThe article reports on the second-quarter earnings of Hasbro and Mattel, the two largest toy manufacturers in the country, which showed a decline in sales of traditional toys due to tariff uncertainty. The uncertainty led to delayed ordering by retailers, resulting in a 1% decline in Hasbro's net sales and a 6% decline in Mattel's revenue.\n\n**Hasbro's Earnings**\n\nDespite the decline in sales, Hasbro's CEO, Chris Cocks, expressed confidence in the company's ability to weather any potential tariff impact in the second half of the year. However, he warned that toy companies might have trouble restocking sold-out holiday toys due to delayed ordering during the first part of the year. Hasbro's net sales were down 1%, less than analysts expected, and the company's earnings and revenue beat expectations.\n\nThe company's Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming business had revenue growth of 16% during the quarter, while the consumer products segment, which includes traditional toys, decreased by 16%. The Magic: The Gathering brand, which Hasbro acquired in 1999, saw particularly explosive growth, with revenue up 23% during the second quarter. The recent release of a Final Fantasy Magic set achieved $200 million in revenue in one day, making it the highest-grossing release to date.\n\n**Mattel's Earnings**\n\nMattel's CEO, Ynon Kreiz, stated that the company is well-positioned to navigate the challenges posed by tariffs. However, the company's sales decline was slightly larger than expected, with a 6% decline in revenue. Despite this, Mattel's earnings beat expectations.\n\nMattel is diversifying away from traditional toys by leaning into its entertainment division. The company recently announced the formation of Mattel Studios, combining its film and television units, and hopes to release one to two films per year, starting in 2026 with Masters of the Universe and Matchbox. Mattel also has a Barbie animated film in the works with the company that created Minions and Despicable Me.\n\n**Impact of Tariffs**\n\nThe ongoing tariffs concerns were reflected in Wall Street's reaction to the second-quarter results, with Hasbro's stock ending the day down 0.9% and Mattel's stock down 4.9%. The tariff uncertainty has led to delayed ordering by retailers, resulting in a decline in sales for both companies.\n\n**Diversification Strategies**\n\nBoth companies have been shifting away from traditional toys as their dominant revenue producer for years. Hasbro's acquisition of Wizards of the Coast has proven to be a wise move, with the company's digital gaming business seeing significant growth. Mattel, on the other hand, is focusing on its entertainment division, with plans to release films and TV shows based on its popular brands.\n\n**Holiday Season Outlook**\n\nDespite the challenges posed by tariffs, both companies are optimistic about the holiday season. Hasbro has a strong lineup of new products, including Magic: The Gathering releases, and Mattel is expected to boost sales with its Hot Wheels, new dolls inspired by the Wicked for Good movie, and updates to the Monster High brand.\n\n**Partnership with OpenAI**\n\nMattel recently announced a partnership with OpenAI to use artificial intelligence tools to create new ways to interact with Mattel toy characters. This partnership is expected to broaden the reach of Mattel's brands and enable the company to leverage new technologies to solidify its leadership and innovation.\n\n**Industry Insights**\n\nAccording to James Zahn, Editor-in-Chief of The Toy Book, large companies like Mattel and Hasbro have advantages that help them mitigate the impact of tariffs. They have deep enough pockets to pull certain levers that smaller companies can't manage, which could help them gain market share toward the end of the year if they can deliver products where others cannot.\n",
      "Source: CNBC - World\nTitle: Nestle flags further potential price hikes as tariffs, commodities weigh on margins\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 10:30:39 GMT\nSummary:\n### Nestle Considers Further Price Hikes Due to Tariffs and Commodity Pressures\n\nNestle, the Swiss food giant, has announced that it may implement further price hikes in the second half of the year due to rising commodity costs and US tariffs. The company has already raised prices in the first half of the year, which contributed to a better-than-expected organic sales growth of 2.9% in the six months to June. However, Nestle's margins have been impacted by higher input costs, currency fluctuations, and tariffs.\n\n### Financial Performance\n\n* **Organic Sales Growth**: Nestle's organic sales growth was 2.9% in the six months to June, above analysts' average forecast of 2.8%.\n* **Price Increases**: The company implemented price rises of 2.7%, slightly ahead of the 2.5% forecast by analysts.\n* **Total Reported Sales**: Nestle's total reported sales declined 1.8% over the period to 44.2 billion Swiss francs ($55.7 billion), slightly more than analyst expectations of 44.6 billion Swiss francs.\n* **Underlying Trading Operating Profit (UTOP) Margins**: Underlying trading operating profit (UTOP) margins dipped 0.9% to 16.5%.\n\n### Commodity Prices and Tariffs\n\n* **Coffee and Cocoa Prices**: Arabica coffee prices have more than doubled since early 2023, while cocoa prices have more than tripled.\n* **Impact on Margins**: The company expects headwinds to worsen in the second half, with margins to be \"significantly below\" the first half due to price rises being \"more than offset by the increase in input costs, tariffs, and fx [foreign exchange].\"\n\n### Guidance and Outlook\n\n* **2025 Guidance**: Despite the challenges, Nestle maintained its 2025 guidance for organic sales growth to improve versus 2024 and for an underlying trading operating profit margin of 16% or above.\n\n### Strategic Review and Restructuring\n\n* **Strategic Review**: The company is conducting a strategic review of some of its underperforming vitamin brands, including Nature's Bounty and Osteo Bi-Flex, which could result in divestment.\n* **'Big Bets' Strategy**: Nestle's CEO, Laurent Freixe, has vowed to refocus the business, saying that a slew of acquisitions under his predecessor had \"weakened the fabric\" of the company. The company has identified six priority product categories, or \"big bets,\" which include infant formula, Nescaf\u00e9 Espresso Concentrate, and Purina's gourmet cat food.\n\n### Stock Performance\n\n* **Stock Decline**: Nestle's stock has lagged major rivals such as Unilever and Danone in recent years, and the shares were down 4.9% by 10:50 a.m. London time on Thursday.\n",
      "Source: NYT World News\nTitle: South Korea Jockeys for a Deal With Trump at Least as Good as Japan\u2019s\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 07:20:54 +0000\nSummary:\n### South Korea's Trade Negotiations with the US: A Detailed Summary\n\nThe article discusses South Korea's efforts to negotiate a trade deal with the United States that is at least as good as the one Japan recently secured. Japan's trade agreement with President Trump, announced earlier in the week, has put pressure on South Korea to strike a deal by August 1 to avoid a 25% tariff on its exports.\n\n### Background and Context\n\nSouth Korea's industry minister, Kim Jung-Kwan, arrived in Washington on Wednesday to negotiate a trade deal. He pledged to make an \"all-out effort\" to reach an agreement by the August 1 deadline. The negotiations are crucial for South Korea, as it faces a similar set of issues as Japan, including agriculture and automobiles. South Korea and Japan have similar powerhouse industries and trade relationships with the US.\n\n### Japan's Trade Agreement with the US\n\nUnder the terms of Japan's trade agreement, President Trump agreed to a tariff rate of 15% on Japanese exports. Japan also vowed to buy more American cars and rice, as well as make investments of over $550 billion at Mr. Trump's direction. Specifically, Japan agreed to:\n\n* Increase imports of American agricultural products, including rice\n* Implement new regulations to reduce non-tariff barriers to American autos and auto parts\n* Invest in American infrastructure and industries, including a joint venture with the US in Alaska\n\n### South Korea's Negotiating Position\n\nSouth Korea has limited negotiating levers, as it already committed to drop most of its tariffs to zero in a 2007 trade agreement. The US and South Korea signed a minor revision to that pact in 2018, lifting caps on American car exports to South Korea. However, the American trade deficit with South Korea has increased every year since then, reaching $66 billion in 2024.\n\n### Key Issues on the Negotiating Agenda\n\nThe South Korean delegation will focus on several key issues, including:\n\n1. **Agriculture:** South Korea is resistant to concessions on agriculture, as eliminating tariffs on agricultural imports could devastate the country's farming industry. The government has drawn a \"red line\" and removed the country's beef and rice markets as possible concessions.\n2. **Automobiles:** The US is seeking greater access to the South Korean market for American autos.\n3. **Digital Services:** American tech companies have protested South Korea's enforcement actions against them, as well as restrictions on foreign companies' use of location data.\n4. **Investment:** The US is seeking investments from South Korea in the hundreds of billions, potentially including a $44 billion natural gas pipeline in Alaska.\n\n### Potential Concessions and Compromises\n\nSouth Korea has made significant investments in the US in recent years, including Hyundai's $21 billion commitment to automotive manufacturing. However, the country has hesitated to commit to the Alaska natural gas project due to high costs and decreasing natural gas demand. South Korean officials are emphasizing developing a more cooperative relationship with the US, rather than one that is purely financial.\n\n### Potential Areas of Cooperation\n\nSome potential areas of cooperation between the US and South Korea include:\n\n1. **Shipbuilding:** Hyundai announced a deal with an American company to help build ships in Tampa.\n2. **Semiconductors:** South Korea could offer assistance in developing American manufacturing capacity in semiconductors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, South Korea is under pressure to strike a trade deal with the US that is at least as good as Japan's. The negotiations will focus on key issues such as agriculture, automobiles, digital services, and investment. South Korea has limited negotiating levers, but is emphasizing developing a more cooperative relationship with the US. The outcome of the negotiations will have significant implications for the US-South Korea trade relationship and the global economy.\n",

The company's net income fell 16.3% to $1.17 billion, and revenue dropped 12% to $22.5 billion compared to the same period in 2024. This marks the second consecutive quarter of declining profits and revenue for Tesla.\n\n### Causes of Decline\n\nThe decline in Tesla's performance can be attributed to several factors:\n\n* **Decline in Car Sales**: The company delivered 13.5% fewer cars in the second quarter, which has led to a decrease in revenue. To stimulate demand, Tesla has been cutting prices, but this has also affected its profit margins.\n* **Reputational Damage**: The polarizing actions of CEO Elon Musk have taken a toll on the company's reputation and sales. Musk's recent foray into politics, including his support for Donald Trump's presidential campaign and his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), have sparked a global backlash. His subsequent resignation from DOGE and launch of a new political party, the America Party, have not helped to alleviate concerns.\n\n### Challenges Ahead\n\nThe road ahead looks challenging for Tesla, with several factors contributing to the company's woes:\n\n* **Loss of EV Tax Credit**: The \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" signed by President Trump on July 4 will eliminate the $7,500 federal EV tax credit as of September 30, making Teslas more expensive for consumers.\n* **Scrapping of Clean-Air Penalties**: The same law will also scrap clean-air penalties for automakers that fail emissions standards, which could impact Tesla's revenue stream from selling regulatory credits to competitors. In Q2, these credit sales declined by nearly half to $439 million.\n* **Tariffs**: Tesla's reliance on imported raw materials and components makes it vulnerable to tariffs, which could lead to increased costs. The company has already started to feel the impact of tariffs, with costs increasing by $300 million in the second quarter.\n\n### Musk's Vision for the Future\n\nDespite the current challenges, Musk remains optimistic about Tesla's future. He envisions the company as a robotics and AI powerhouse, built on humanoid robots, automation, and self-driving technology. However, the recent launch of Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin has raised concerns about the company's competitiveness in this space. Waymo, Google's self-driving subsidiary, already operates fully autonomous robotaxis across multiple US cities, covering a larger area than Tesla's service.\n\n### Impact on Core Customer Base\n\nMusk's polarizing actions have had a significant impact on Tesla's core customer base, particularly in the US and Europe. The company's liberal buyers have been alienated by Musk's support for right-wing causes, leading to a decline in sales. According to the article, Musk's actions have \"pushed away the liberal buyers in the U.S. and Europe who once formed the bedrock of Tesla's support.\"\n\n### Future Prospects\n\nMusk warned that Tesla may face \"rough quarters\" ahead, citing the unpredictable environment on the tariff front and the impact of the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" on the company's business. While he remains optimistic about Tesla's long-term prospects, the company's short-term challenges are significant. The combination of slowing demand, price cuts, disappearing EV incentives, and rising tariffs suggests that Tesla's earnings pain may not be over soon.\n",
      "Source: CNBC - World\nTitle: World\u2019s largest olive oil producer warns U.S. consumers of a double whammy from Trump tariffs\nDate: Thu, 24 Jul 2025 05:12:12 GMT\nSummary:\n### Summary of Article \n\nThe article discusses the potential impact of US President Donald Trump's threat to impose 30% tariffs on imports from the European Union (EU) on US consumers, particularly with regards to olive oil. Spain's Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has warned that the tariffs could lead to higher prices and limited access to olive oil for US consumers.\n\n### Background \n\nDeoleo, the maker of household olive oil brands such as Bertolli and Carbonell, has a significant presence in the US market, accounting for more than a quarter of its total revenue. The company has expressed concerns that the tariffs could affect American consumers, given that approximately 95% of the olive oil consumed in the US is imported.\n\n### Impact on US Consumers \n\nThe tariffs, which are set to take effect on August 1, would mark a steep jump from the current 10% duty. Deoleo's CEO, Crist\u00f3bal Vald\u00e9s, has stated that the company's priority is to protect American consumers' access to olive oil, which is an essential food product for their health. Vald\u00e9s emphasized that access to olive oil should not be penalized, but rather promoted.\n\n### Limited US Production \n\nThe US produces a relatively small amount of olive oil, with around 40,000 acres of olives planted exclusively for olive oil production, compared to the EU's 4 million hectares. This limited production capacity makes the US reliant on imports to meet domestic demand.\n\n### Potential Consequences \n\nThe imposition of tariffs could have significant consequences for the global olive oil market. A reduction in US olive oil imports could lead to a supply glut in the EU, resulting in downward price pressure and intensified competition among producers. Analysts at commodity data firm Expana have warned that this could have \"serious repercussions\" for the global market.\n\n### Broader Impact \n\nThe article also notes that the impact of Trump's tariff threats extends beyond olive oil exporters. Other industries, such as Irish whiskey firms, Italian cheesemakers, and French wine producers, have also sounded the alarm over the potential consequences of the tariffs.\n\n### Possible Outcomes \n\nDeoleo is exploring its strategic options and working on logistics and supply chain improvements to respond to different market scenarios. The company is committed to protecting American consumers' access to olive oil and promoting its availability.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nThe EU is currently scrambling to reach a trade deal with the US, and there are hopes that a framework agreement between the US and Japan could pave the way for a breakthrough. However, huge uncertainty persists over whether the US and EU can strike a deal before the tariffs take effect. If a deal is not reached, US consumers may face higher prices and limited access to olive oil, a staple in many American diets. The situation remains uncertain, and Deoleo and other affected industries will be closely monitoring developments in the coming days.\n"
